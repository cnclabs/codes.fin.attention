item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global supplier of broadband fixed wireless access fwa equipment that allows communications service providers often referred to as local exchange carriers  or simply telephone companies to cost effectively deliver integrated high speed data and voice services using radio frequencies rather than wires 
we were originally organized in as a unit within dsc communications corporation  a telecommunications equipment manufacturer 
dsc began developing fixed wireless access systems in in january we created a new corporation that purchased the airspan unit from dsc for million  million of which was due in the form of debt payable over three years beginning february  and the balance through the issuance of million shares of preferred stock 
when alcatel acquired dsc in  we redeemed the preferred stock held by dsc for a cash payment of million 
during february we moved to our own premises in uxbridge  uk our corporate headquarters are in sunrise  florida 
we generated revenue of million in  million in  and million in we have incurred net losses of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow and expect to continue to do so in we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generate revenue from sales of our systems including both hardware and software and from services related to implementation and support activities 
sales of our systems  primarily our as product  constituted of revenues in  in and in following our purchase of the airspan unit from dsc  we continued to sell products developed while we were a division of dsc  which we refer to as our older generation products 
the older generation products allowed only one subscriber terminal on each cdma radio channel  which limits the number of subscriber lines per base station to in  we introduced products that assign radio channels to users only when needed  which significantly expanded the potential number of users per system 
we refer to these products  which also have higher margins than our older generation products  as our newer generation products 
the newer generation products use technology that allocates a cdma channel on subscriber demand and allow a single radio channel to support in excess of subscriber lines 
base stations may be configured with multiple radio channels a large site with radio channels can support up to  subscriber lines 
older generation product sales accounted for of total sales in  of total sales in and less than in we expect future sales of older generation products to be insignificant 
our proprietary software is integral to our products and is not sold separately 
customer service contracts are generally of a short term nature  for days and weeks rather than months  and are sold separately from sales of our systems 
although service revenue does not currently constitute a material portion of our revenue  we believe that going forward  services will increase as a percentage of our revenue 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by sab a and b revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenues are recognized when all of the following conditions are met o an arrangement exists with the customer  o delivery has occurred or services have been endered  o the price for the product or service is fixed and determinable  and o collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales  including sales to our distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue is deferred when  customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist  or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
once these conditions have been satisfied  revenue is recognized 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience 
revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts that relate to a period of cover is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method unless we are not unable to make reasonable estimates under that method  in which case revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple deliveries 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
we recognize revenue for delivered products and services only if i the above product revenue or service revenue criteria are met  ii undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services  and iv the fair value for each of the undelivered elements is known 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we have a direct sales presence in the us  us  australia  brazil  canada  china  czech republic  germany  indonesia  the philippines  poland  russia  and sri lanka 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in the longer term  we expect us sales to increase as a percentage of our total sales 
in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue compared to in we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial percentage of our revenue from fewer than ten customers 
in the year ended december  there were no customers that individually accounted for more than ten percent of the year s revenue 
in the year ended december   suntel private ltd  eircom plc and telbeskid sp 
zo 
o represented  and  respectively  of our revenue 
for the year ended december   suntel private ltd  aliatel as and eircom  plc represented  and  respectively  of our revenue 
while we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on sales to a small number of key customers in the foreseeable future  we believe that the concentrated dependence will continue to lessen 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  geographic area united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south america cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems  volume discounts granted to significant customers and the proportion of total revenue of sales of software  which typically carries a higher gross margin than hardware 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development and testing facilities and equipment 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities including cost associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and for the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  professional and consulting fees and other related expenses including facilities costs 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to general and administrative expenses 
during the third quarter  in an effort to reduce our expenses to a level that supported our revised revenue expectations at the time  we reduced our expenses across all of the above described categories 
in  we expect that research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will remain broadly in line with levels of expenditure in the third and fourth quarter of however  the percentage of revenue that each of these categories represents will vary depending on the rate of our revenue growth and investments that may be required to support the development of new products and our penetration of new markets 
we outsource most of our manufacturing processes to universal scientific industrial co 
and  to a lesser extent  flextronics international and we expect to continue to use contract manufacturers 
we also purchase some of the key components of our products from single vendors for which alternative sources are generally not readily available 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful debt  excess or obsolete inventory  warranty costs  restructuring costs  the valuation goodwill  and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependant on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition within our revenue recognition policy see note in the notes to the financial statements we are required to make a judgement as to the collectibility of the resultant receivable 
we use our judgment in assessing the collectibility of the resultant receivable  and the criteria by which each judgment is made may change in future periods and therefore may change future revenue recognition 
accounts receivable we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods to reflect our current judgment  and changes may occur in the future due to the market environment 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
should we decide in future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or our assumptions change due to changing market conditions  then additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty costs typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring during  we recorded reserves of million in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on subletting excess facilities  and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
valuation of goodwill goodwill  the excess of purchase price including associated expenses paid over net assets of the business acquired  is being amortized over its estimated useful life 
we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the review  we make various assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on goodwill during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that a material impairment charge will not be recorded at the time the review is completed 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in our registration statement and prospectus see item legal proceedings  and may also face litigation for labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 
results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  revenue cost of revenue inventory provision gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt provision general and administrative acquired in process research and development and amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain on extinguishment of debt income tax charge 
gain after tax net loss restructuring in the summer of  we announced our plan to reduce spending levels as a result of the global economic slow down in the telecommunications sector 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating expenses and recorded a charge of million in relation to this program 
included in this charge are costs related to excess facilities and severance 
there was no corresponding restructuring charge in we initially expected to sublease our excess facility space by the end of the first quarter of  however  due to the severity of the economic slow down we now expect to sublet such space by the end of this change in our expectations does not have a material effect on the restructuring provision 
all severance payments will be made by the end of the third quarter the total number of employees being terminated as part of this plan is at december   four of these employees were still working in the company 
as of december  the restructuring charge and its utilization is summarized as follows initial remaining accrued charged accrued restructuring against restructuring charge liability charge facility related 
severance and other included within the third quarter facility restructuring charge is million for the write down of certain fixed assets  mainly furniture and fixtures 
all other charges will result in direct cash outlays 
the fixed assets will be disposed of as part of the sublease program  once the office is sublet 
the realizable value of these assets has been estimated from the expected market price of similar assets 
as a result of our restructuring plan we expect to make savings in the region of million  million and million  within sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenditure  respectively 
the majority of the savings arise from reduced personnel costs 
all savings are cashflow savings on the day that we cease the activity or release the specific personnel  except for our provision for under utilized space in which we are contractually obligated  to december  to pay the full rental amount until a sub lessor is found 
full annual rental on this property  payable quarterly in advance  is million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the growth in revenue was due to the increased demand from the usa  africa and south america  which was partially offset by declines in europe 
africa s and south america s growth occurred as a result of further network build outs and the addition of new customers in those regions 
the strong growth in the usa was significantly aided by fcc mandated usage rules for pcs spectrum that was auctioned in  which require pcs operators to use that spectrum within years of acquiring it or to give it back to the us government 
our increase in revenue was driven by volume  rather than price increases 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the substantial increase in revenue 
during the third quarter of we ceased marketing certain product variants and we also undertook a detailed review of the levels and mix of related inventory 
as a result we wrote down inventory in the third quarter of by million 
excluding the inventory write down  gross margin was for the year ended december  and we were able to keep the gross margin at as a result of cost savings from product design changes and  to a lesser extent  efficiencies from increased volume and introduction of lower priced components in products sold  offset by lower selling prices 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as part of our operating expense reduction program introduced in the third quarter of  we have re focused our research and development priorities to lower our ongoing product development costs 
under the program  we will focus spending only on those products we can sell in large volumes and in markets that we believe are strategic to our long term growth 
the full year effect of this program will be felt in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting a higher headcount and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
during we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers and countries that have been most effected by economic slow downs 
in we created bad debt provisions of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this reflected our higher headcount  additional costs associated with being a public company and the full year costs of our corporate headquarters facility in florida that opened at the end of amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the full write off of purchase contracts and patents 
restructuring provision in the middle of  we announced our plan to reduce spending levels as a result of the global economic slow down in the telecommunications sector 
during the third quarter of  we made a restructuring provision of million to cover employee termination costs and facility closures 
there was no corresponding restructuring charge in interest and other income net interest and other income  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions  foreign exchange gains and losses on cash balances and the cost of purchasing foreign exchange contracts and options 
the decrease in interest income arose from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of million in the year ended december   predominantly on outstanding indebtedness owed to alcatel related to the purchase of the company s assets in january and million in the year ended december  interest expense decreased as a result of the prepayment of the debt to alcatel 
income taxes in general we did not record an income tax benefit for the tax losses generated in the uk because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
the tax provision relates to the repayment of overpaid us federal income taxes 
the tax credit provision of includes a million credit to offset the income tax expense recorded on our extraordinary gain and a million income tax benefit for us tax losses offset against previous years federal income taxes paid on intercompany interest income 
extraordinary gain the company negotiated a settlement of its million promissory note with dsc telcom lp in the first quarter of under the settlement agreement  the company agreed to pay million in the first half of  in exchange for complete forgiveness of the debt owed by the company that was originally repayable in equal installments over three years starting february  in addition  the company and dsc telcom lp mutually released each other from certain claims made by the parties relating to the formation of airspan in january the extraordinary gain of million that arose from this transaction was partially offset by tax on the gain of million to show an extraordinary gain  net of taxes  of million 
net loss net loss decreased by from million in to million in before the inventory provision  bad debt provision  restructuring provision and extraordinary gain our net loss for was million  a decrease over this was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million before provisions  and decrease in research and development costs of million  which were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in net interest and other income of million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the growth in revenue was due to the increased demand of our newer generation  higher priced products predominantly from customers located in europe  asia pacific and usa  in which revenues increased by and and  respectively 
our increase in revenue was driven by volume  rather than price increases 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   resulting from the substantial increase in revenue 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the gross margin improvement reflected primarily the results of product design changes and  to a lesser extent  efficiencies from increased volume and introduction of lower priced components in products sold 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to increased headcount and increased spending on the product development of our packet data product 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting a higher headcount and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses for and included provisions of less than million and million  respectively  for potential bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting a higher headcount and additional costs associated with being a public company 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the write off of purchase contracts and patents 
interest and other income net interest and other income increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  and consisted of interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions  foreign exchange gains and losses on cash balances and the cost of purchasing foreign exchange contracts and options 
the increased interest was from higher cash balances from additional equity capital raised in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of million and million respectively  predominantly on outstanding indebtedness owed to dsc related to the purchase of the company s assets in january income taxes we did not record an income tax benefit for the tax losses generated in the uk because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
the tax provisions relates to us federal income taxes currently payable primarily attributable to intercompany interest income 
the tax provision relates to the repayment of overpaid us federal income taxes 
net loss net loss decreased by from million in to million in  due to increases in interest income 
increases in research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses offset increases in revenue  gross profits and interest income 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  and million of restricted cash that is held as collateral for performance guarantees on customer and supplier contracts and with landlords 
we do not have a line of credit or similar borrowing facility  nor do we have any material capital commitments 
since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of convertible preferred stock  which totaled million net of transaction expenses and an initial public offering of common stock  which we completed on july  in that offering  we issued  shares of common stock for approximately million in cash net of underwriting discounts  commission and other expenses 
we have used the net proceeds of the offering for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million compared to million at december  the reduction was primarily due to the first half settlement for million of the million promissory note payable to alcatel formerly to dsc telecom lp for the year ended december   we used million cash in operating activities compared with million for the year ended december  the cash used in operations is primarily a result of the operating loss and changes in working capital 
the net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  and december  was all related to capital equipment 
our financing cash flows for the year ended december  were a net outflow of million 
the outflows arose from million of payment of long term debt  of which million was paid to alcatel in settlement of the million promissory note  offset by a million decrease in restricted cash 
restricted cash increases whenever the company issues a guarantee secured by cash collateral and decreases whenever such a guarantee is cancelled or expires according to its terms 
we have no material commitments other than obligations under our long term debt  capital equipment leases  operating leases  and the forward exchange contracts mentioned herein 
other matters on october   the company adopted sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the requisite accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recorded a net of tax cumulative effect type adjustment of million at december  in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments 
the company recorded cash flow hedge derivatives assets of million at december  as a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
based on the exchange rate at december   the company would expect to reclassify as gains to earnings during the next twelve months million from accumulated other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
substantially all of these amounts consisted of highly liquid investments with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates of percent from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars  with the remaining predominantly denominated in euro 
for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in euro and the remaining were denominated in us dollars 
our total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  were eur million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us eur 
if the average exchange rate used had been higher or lower by it would have decreased or increased the euro denominated sales value by million 
we expect the proportions of sales in euro to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
since may  we have from time to time entered into fair value currency hedging contracts that lock in minimum exchange rates for payments due to us under some of our sales contracts where those payments are to be made in currencies other than us dollars 
we do not enter into any currency hedging activities for speculative purposes 
there was no impact from such contracts during on earnings  nor were there any fair value hedges outstanding at december  we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposures and may modify our hedging strategies  as we deem appropriate 
we have also entered into cash flow currency hedges 
our operating results are affected by moves in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the rate between us dollars and us pounds sterling 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling 
to manage our pound sterling foreign currency risk we have at various times forecast our likely net spending in pounds sterling until december  and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover at least of the projected exposure 
we have entered into the following forward exchange contracts in november  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in sixteen equal amounts from that date to february at december   there were two payments outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
in may  we entered into two forward exchange contracts 
the first was to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in eleven equal amounts from june to april at december   there were four payments outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
the second was to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in two equal amounts  one in march  the other in april at december   these were outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
in october  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in eight equal amounts  from may to december at december  these were outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
the total forward purchases of pounds sterling for the year ended december   was million pounds sterling  and we paid expenses in local currency of approximately million pounds sterling over the same period 
the effectiveness of the contracts as a hedge was therefore of spending 
the cost of the ineffectiveness was immaterial 
if the expenses in pounds sterling had not been hedged and the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the pound sterling denominated operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million 
during  we incurred the majority of our cost of revenue in swedish krona 
with the move of our printed circuit board sub contracted production from sweden to scotland at the beginning of  we eliminated the krona payments  and for the year ended december  we incurred the majority of our cost of revenue in us dollars 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
