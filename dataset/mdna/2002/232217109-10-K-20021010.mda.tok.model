all references to fiscal years are references to our fiscal year ended april overview cutter buck is a lifestyle brand with broad demographic appeal  targeted at men and women who seek updated classic american styles with the latest textile and fashion innovations 
we sell our distinctive sportswear  fashion and outerwear products through golf pro shops and resorts  corporate accounts  specialty retail stores  international distributors and licensees and other distribution channels 
our flagship company owned retail store is located in seattle 
as of april  we had thirteen additional stores in selected metropolitan markets 
restatement and recent events in consultation with our independent auditors  we restated our audited financial statements for the years ended april  and  and our unaudited financial statements for each of the quarters in those years and the quarters ended july   october  and january  we initially announced our intention to restate certain financial statements on august  that announcement was made after our new chairman and chief executive officer  appointed april  discovered certain accounting irregularities 
in early august  shortly after her discovery  the board of directors appointed a special committee to investigate these irregularities 
the preliminary conclusion of the special committee was that approximately million of shipments to three distributors made on a consignment basis during fiscal had been recorded as sales of inventory for that year 
subsequent to that announcement  the special committee continued its investigation in order to confirm whether any additional accounting irregularities occurred 
the special committee was assisted in its investigation by our regular outside legal counsel  special independent legal counsel  a forensic accounting firm and our independent auditors 
see part i  item business restatement information 
the restatement and the recent events that resulted from the restatement create additional risks and uncertainties as to our future operations 
some of those risks and uncertainties include management believes that recent booking levels have been negatively impacted by recent disclosures by the company and it is uncertain how future sales will be affected 
to date  we have not lost any significant suppliers  however  the willingness of suppliers to do business with us and any required changes in trade terms could negatively impact future margins and costs 
management believes that employee loyalty and perception of job security have been impaired 
as a result  we have provided contingent financial incentives designed to retain certain key employees 
this program will increase future employment related costs significantly 
in addition  there will be recruitment costs to the extent departed officers are replaced and  under present circumstances  that recruitment could be difficult and the associated costs significant 
three lawsuits have been filed against the company and certain former officers 
plaintiffs in these cases have stated their intention to establish a class 
the company has notified its insurance carriers of these lawsuits  but there is a substantial deductible and no assurance can be given that insurance will cover the full costs of the litigation 
the amount of a judgment or settlement  if any  of these cases will impact future operating results and cash flow depending on the amounts  if any  that may be ultimately recovered from insurance 
we have and will continue to incur substantial legal and other professional service costs in connection with recent lawsuits  restating our financial statements along with its related internal investigation  public disclosures  and responding to the nasdaq delisting proceeding and the inquiries of the sec and nasdaq 
while the actual costs cannot be determined  management estimates that the costs associated with the restatement will be at least million 
former officers have made indemnification claims against us related to the sec and nasdaq investigations and the recent lawsuits 
the ultimate cost of such indemnifications cannot currently be estimated nor can the extent to which any costs will be covered by insurance 
as more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  we are out of compliance with certain covenants contained in our current line of credit agreement 
we are in discussions with our lenders and are determining the availability of any alternative forms of credit 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain other credit on terms commercially reasonable 
any changes that may be necessary in our credit arrangements may impact our borrowing costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began implementing a restructuring plan to reduce our operating costs  streamline our organizational structure and focus on those areas of our business that we believe provide the greatest growth and profit opportunities 
the major initiatives of this plan included closing our wholly owned european subsidiary cutter buck europe bv we plan to serve this market through a licensing agreement with a european distributor 
in addition  we are exiting the golf shoe business and the dressier side of our women s line  writing down assets of under performing company owned stores and excess warehouse space and restructuring our women s line sales forces 
we substantially completed these restructuring initiatives at the end of the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the continued slowed economy as well as the discontinued sales lines  we do not expect sales to grow in fiscal we expect to reduce our operating expenses except for those associated with the restatement and increase gross margins as a result of our restructuring activities  however  it is not clear this will allow us to be profitable in fiscal or thereafter 
results of operations the results of operations for the fiscal years and and each of the quarters therein and the first three quarters of fiscal are presented after restatement 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales restated year ended april  consolidated statements of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses design and production selling and shipping general and administrative restructuring and asset impairment total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense factor commission and interest expense  net of interest income license and royalty income  net of other expense total other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended april  compared to the year ended april  net sales during fiscal  total net sales decreased approximately million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to lower consumer and corporate spending on our products due to economic conditions 
the detail of net sales by distribution channel is as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail stores consumer direct international shipping and other during fiscal net sales to the golf distribution channel decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in net sales in this distribution channel was primarily due to inventory saturation in the marketplace and lower consumer demand  due in part to a decline in tourist travel to resorts and destination golf courses 
net sales to the corporate channel decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in net sales to this distribution channel was primarily due to a decline in corporate spending on marketing programs as a result of current economic conditions 
net sales to the specialty retail distribution channel decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to lower consumer spending on our products due in part to soft consumer demand for apparel 
net sales to our consumer direct distribution channel  including company owned retail stores  increased million or  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to additional stores being open during fiscal net sales to our international distribution channel  which include sales of our wholly owned european subsidiary and to distributors and licensees  decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to the slowing global economy  the decline in tourist travel to resorts and destination golf courses  and our decision to close our european operations 
net sales to our other distribution channel  including shipping revenue and liquidation sales  increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales in this distribution channel was primarily due to an increase in liquidation sales 
liquidation sales increased due to the lack of acceptance of the dressier component of our women s fashion collection  an increase in the number of liquidation sales as a result of our implementation of our restructuring plan and lower consumer demand for apparel 
beginning in fiscal year  we realigned our management structure into strategic business units sbus  golf  corporate  fashion formerly specialty retail stores  consumer direct includes company owned retail stores and e commerce  formerly included in other  and international 
the detail of net sales by sbu is as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate fashion consumer direct international shipping and other gross margin in fiscal  our gross margin was of net sales  compared to in fiscal the decrease during fiscal was due to inventory write downs related to our restructuring plan  higher liquidation losses and higher off price discounts driven by the competitive retail environment and our efforts to reduce our inventory levels 
design and production expenses design and production expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the dollar amount of production expenses remained level 
the increase in design expenses was primarily attributable to additional personnel and sample development costs to support our women s line 
selling and shipping expenses selling and shipping expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to decreased commissions and salary costs  travel and sales meeting costs and marketing and fixturing costs 
this decrease in selling expenses was partially offset by increased shipping expenses and store level operating expenses 
the increase in shipping expenses was primarily due to increased facilities costs and depreciation expenses associated with the distribution center which were partially offset by lower salary and contract labor costs 
the increase in store level operating expenses associated with company owned retail stores included in selling and shipping expenses reflects increased expenses associated with the operation of fourteen retail locations during fiscal compared to twelve in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased depreciation and rent expense associated with corporate facilities  depreciation associated with information technology initiatives  increased amortization of deferred compensation  increased bad debt expense related to credit exposures  and increased insurance  legal and accounting expenses 
restructuring and asset impairment in the third quarter of fiscal  we began implementing a restructuring plan to reduce our operating costs  streamline our organizational structure and focus on those areas of our business that we believe provide the greatest growth and profit opportunities 
the major initiatives of this restructuring plan include closing our wholly owned european subsidiary  cutter buck europe bv  establishing a licensing relationship to serve key european markets  refining our company owned retail store strategy  consolidating and restructuring our women s line sales forces  discontinuing our golf shoe business  discontinuing the dressier side of our women s line  closing three under performing company owned retail stores in fiscal  recording a loss on the sublease of a portion of our excess warehouse space and certain management changes 
as a result of implementing our restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of approximately million in fiscal included in the million restructuring and asset impairment charge is a charge related to our european operations of approximately million 
this component of the charge includes termination and severance benefits to be paid as a result of the involuntary termination of approximately employees located in the netherlands  reserves necessary to write down that operation s receivables due to lower than anticipated recoveries  the write down of other current assets  furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements to net realizable value  the recognition of accumulated translation losses and other costs resulting from closing our european subsidiary 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of write downs for our european inventory expected to be sold below cost 
this has been recorded in cost of sales on the statements of operations 
effective may  we entered into a license agreement with eurostyle ltd 
to distribute cutter buck men s and women s golf and classic apparel collections and golf accessories throughout europe 
the license agreement requires certain minimum royalty payments and expires on june  effective may  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement with eurostyle ltd 
to sell inventory  certain accounts receivable balances and fixturing 
we had substantially completed the closure of our european operations as of april  and expect to settle the remaining liabilities in accordance with contract terms which extend into fiscal certain activities will continue in fiscal to collect accounts receivable and to finalize liquidation of the subsidiary 
our restructuring plan included refining our retail strategy 
we engaged a consultant to assist us in this process and performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the assets relating to our retail stores 
we concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant impairment of long lived assets had occurred and decided to close three under performing stores and adjust the net book value of another two full price stores to their estimated fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our estimates of future cash flows are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
assets to be disposed of are measured at the lower of our carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we engaged a second consultant to assist us in renegotiating our retail store leases and decided to close three previously identified under performing stores during fiscal as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million relating to store fixed asset write downs primarily leasehold improvements  lease termination costs and store closure costs 
as we continue to evaluate and refine our retail strategy we may incur additional write downs of the related assets to their estimated fair values or other charges relating to possible store closures 
during fiscal we completed the consolidation and restructuring of our women s line sales forces 
under this initiative  substantially all of the golf and specialty store territories that were previously served by sales representatives dedicated exclusively to our women s products were either combined with existing territories served by sales representatives selling our men s products  converted to territories served by multi line sales representatives or converted to commission only territories effective may  five sales representatives were involuntarily terminated and we recorded a write off of approximately million relating to commission draws and sample receivable balances 
during fiscal we also decided to discontinue our golf shoe business as well as the dressier side of our women s line 
as a result we recorded a charge of million relating to the loss on liquidation of our remaining shoe inventory and million relating to fall fashion inventory expected to be sold below cost 
these amounts are recorded in cost of sales on the statements of operations 
we also recorded a charge of approximately million relating to the write off of prepaid sample expenses for our fall fashion line and severance benefits for five employees who were involuntarily terminated as of april  this amount has been recorded in restructuring and asset impairment on the statements of operations 
also included in restructuring and asset impairment on the statement of operations is a charge of million relating to the transitions of both our former chief executive officer and our former president 
partially as a result of our restructuring  we have excess warehouse capacity at our distribution center 
we have subleased this unused capacity to third parties 
included in restructuring and asset impairment is a charge of million relating to a loss on these subleases 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we decided to abandon additional warehouse space and expect to record an additional charge of million 
at april   we had gross lease obligations of million relating to the total excess warehouse space 
we anticipate receiving sublease income to partially offset this obligation 
due to the uncertainty of estimating future sublease income  actual results may differ significantly from this estimate 
for the year ended april   the total restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows asset impairment  lease obligations  termination benefits  foreign currency translation loss  other restructuring costs  total cash outlays relating to the restructuring and asset impairment charges are expected to be approximately million  of which million has been paid to date 
activity in the accrued liability associated with the restructuring charges consisted of the following total accrued liabilities payments balance at april  due within year due after year lease obligations     termination benefits     other restructuring costs     we expect to record an additional million in charges during the first quarter of fiscal related to the abandonment of warehouse space 
the amounts recorded represent management s best estimate of the costs to be incurred 
the actual amounts incurred could vary from these estimates if future developments differ from the underlying assumptions used in developing the accrual 
costs that relate to ongoing operations are not a part of restructuring charges and are not included in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 classification of inventory markdowns and other costs associated with a restructuring  all inventory adjustments resulting from the discontinuation of our golf shoe business and the dressier side of our women s line and closure of our european subsidiary are recorded in cost of sales on the statements of operations 
as of april   inventory write downs relating to these activities were approximately million 
operating income as a result of the above items  operating income decreased by million  to an operating loss of million in fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal factor commission and interest expense  net of interest income factor commission and interest expense  net of interest income  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with capital leases 
factoring during fiscal was limited to our european operations 
license and royalty income  net of other expense license and royalty income  net of other expense  decreased by million  or  to million  representing of net sales in fiscal  from million and of net sales in fiscal we expect license income to increase in fiscal as a result of entering into a license agreement with eurostyle ltd 
this category includes gains and losses from foreign currency transactions which resulted in a net transaction loss of  in fiscal compared to a gain of  in fiscal and accounted for the decrease in this category 
income taxes we recorded million of income tax benefit in fiscal the effective rate for income taxes in fiscal and was and  respectively 
this decrease in the effective rate resulted primarily from non deductible restructuring and asset impairment charges and may be offset by state tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  net sales during fiscal  total net sales increased million  or  to million 
the detail of net sales by distribution channel is as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail stores consumer direct international shipping and other during fiscal net sales to the golf distribution channel increased million or from the prior year 
although sales to our golf distribution channel remained constant  the number of golf pro shops purchasing cutter buck products increased in fiscal this was primarily due to the growth in the size of our golf sales force including the number of sales representatives that showcase our women s line 
net sales through the corporate distribution channel increased million  or approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal represented approximately of the total increase in net sales for the year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the increased size and effectiveness of our exclusive corporate sales force  increases in product styles and inventory levels of our classics products  relationships with a greater number of promotional products companies that resell cutter buck apparel to corporate accounts and our growing brand strength 
specialty retail store sales increased million or approximately to million in fiscal representing approximately of our net sales in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of specialty retail stores purchasing cutter buck products 
net sales to our consumer direct channel  including company owned retail stores  increased million or to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to additional stores being open during fiscal international sales  which include sales of our wholly owned european subsidiary  distributors and licensees were relatively flat compared to fiscal sales through other distribution channels  including shipping revenue and liquidation sales  increased from million  or of net sales  in fiscal to million  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher liquidation sales to move out of season fashion inventory 
gross margin in fiscal  our gross margin was of net sales  compared to in fiscal the decrease during fiscal was due to higher off channel liquidation sales primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal and higher levels of sales allowances than in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross margin due to lower unit costs and increased sales through our retail stores and higher margin women s line 
design and production expenses design and production expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal design expenses reflect the additional personnel  sample development and travel costs to support our expanding sportswear collection  including our women s line and accessories products 
the increase in production expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel  quality control and travel costs  and costs associated with the strengthening of our embroidery development organization to support our growing embroidery business 
selling and shipping expenses selling and shipping expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling expenses was attributable to increased salaries and commissions  travel and training costs associated with the increase in our sales force and increased trade advertising  showroom costs  and customer service staffing associated with a higher sales volume 
in addition  fixturing expenses increased due to the continued investment in our in store and concept shop fixture program 
during fiscal  we purchased and installed approximately million of in store and concept shop fixturing 
the investment in these fixtures is amortized as a marketing expense over a three year period 
the increase in shipping expenses was primarily due to increased warehouse staffing expense  rent and depreciation expense and packaging supplies costs 
warehouse staffing costs increased as a result of having a more highly skilled workforce and stronger distribution center management 
rent and depreciation expense increased due to the new distribution center and the warehouse management system 
packaging supplies costs increased with the higher levels of inventory 
the store level operating expenses associated with company owned retail stores are also included in selling and shipping expenses and reflect expenses associated with twelve retail locations during fiscal compared to six in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but remained of net sales in both fiscal and fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to increased management and staffing costs  including costs associated with our retail operations and e commerce initiative  increased depreciation and rent expense associated with information technology initiatives and corporate facilities  increased insurance costs  legal and communications expenses  and our corporate social responsibility initiative 
operating income as a result of the above items  operating income decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal factor commission and interest expense  net of interest income factor commission and interest expense  net of interest income  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with capital leases entered into during fiscal and increases in our line of credit

license and royalty income  net of other expense license and royalty income  net of other expense  increased by million  or  to million  representing of net sales in fiscal  from million and of net sales in fiscal this category includes gains and losses from foreign currency transactions which resulted in a net transaction gain of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and accounted for a significant portion of the increase in this category 
income taxes we recorded million of income tax expense in fiscal the effective rates for income taxes in fiscal and were and  respectively 
the effective rate increased as we opened retail stores in additional states  thereby incurring increased state income taxes 
quarterly results and seasonality historically  we have generally experienced our lowest levels of net sales in the first and third quarters ending july and january  respectively 
correspondingly  our highest level of net sales are achieved in the second and fourth quarters  ending october and april  respectively 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to the timing of shipments to golf pro shops and specialty retail stores in the second and fourth quarters 
other factors contributing to the variability of our quarterly results include seasonal fluctuations in consumer demand  the timing and amount of orders from key customers  the timing and magnitude of sales of seasonal remainder merchandise and availability of product 
this pattern of sales creates seasonal profitability and working capital financing and liquidity issues  as we generally must finance higher levels of inventory during the first and third quarters when our net sales are lowest 
as a result  our operating results may fall below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could materially harm the market price of our common stock 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial data  including percentages of net sales  for the eight quarters ended april  the amounts are after the restatement discussed above  and differ from the results disclosed for the quarter ended april  by us in a press release dated june  quarterly results in thousands as restated quarter ended july  oct

this resulted primarily from a decrease in inventory of million  including inventory write downs related to our restructuring plan  depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income taxes of million  noncash restructuring and asset impairment charges of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the restructuring and asset impairment charges and inventory write downs were recorded as part of our restructuring plan 
these decreases were partially offset by a net loss of million  increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and the timing of payments for certain payables 
approximately million of the decrease in inventory relates to classics merchandise  million relates to fashion merchandise  million relates to footwear and accessories  million relates to retail stores and e commerce  million in embroidery work in process and other and million in our european operations 
the decrease in inventory in fiscal resulted from the implementation of our restructuring plan as well as our planned reduction in inventory levels to align inventories with our sales expectations 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million 
this resulted primarily from increases in inventory of million  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  deferred income taxes of million and income tax payable of million 
these increases were partially offset by cash generated from operations  collections of account receivables and the timing of payments for certain payables 
approximately million of the increase in inventory relates to classics merchandise  million relates to footwear and accessories and million relates to retail stores and e commerce 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in fashion inventory  million in embroidery work in process and other and million in our european operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily due to purchases of capital equipment of approximately million 
capital expenditures  including equipment acquired under capital leases  included million for in store fixturing and concept shops  million for computer hardware and software  million for equipment and leasehold improvements associated with company owned retail stores and million for the distribution center and warehouse management system 
capital expenditures during fiscal  including equipment acquired under capital leases  included million for in store fixturing and concept shops  million for equipment and leasehold improvements associated with company owned retail stores  million for the distribution center and warehouse management system  million for the development of our e commerce website and million for computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and other furniture and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal this resulted from net repayments of debt of million and principal payments under capital leases of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the sale of million of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal this resulted from net borrowings of million and the exercise of stock options as well as the sale of million of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
these increases were partially offset by million of principal payments under capital leases 
capital expenditures of approximately million are planned for fiscal  including amounts for information technology initiatives  in store fixtures and concept shops  equipment and leasehold improvements associated with company owned retail stores  computer hardware  software  and furniture and office equipment 
in march  we renewed and modified our loan agreement with washington mutual bank covering our million line of credit 
the loan agreement contains certain restrictive covenants covering minimum working capital  tangible net worth and interest service coverage  as well as a maximum debt to equity ratio and maximum capital expenditures 
our primary need for funds is to finance increased working capital and to fund capital expenditures 
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations  as well as the ability to borrow under bank lines of credit or alternative sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in the short term and during the next fiscal year 
however  our capital needs will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the need to finance increased production and inventory levels  the success of our various sales and marketing programs  expenses associated with the risks and uncertainties related to our restatement  including those risks and uncertainties set forth above and various other factors 
depending upon our growth and working capital needs  we may require additional financing in the future through debt or equity offerings  which may or may not be available or may be dilutive 
we are currently out of compliance with certain financial covenants on our million line of credit 
as a result  our lending banks are not obligated to make credit available to us under the line of credit 
since we announced our intention to restate our financial statements  we have been assessing our credit needs and have been in discussions with our lenders 
after our restructuring we have determined that a credit facility of million would meet our operating needs as compared to the current facility of million 
it is not clear the existing bank will elect to continue the credit line with us at either the existing amount or a lower amount 
however  based on ongoing discussions with alternative sources of financing  we believe that sufficient financing in the form of asset based or vendor financing will be available if the existing lenders or other lenders elect not to extend a sufficient credit line to the company 
if our lenders choose not to continue to lend to the company and we are unable to find alternative sources of financing  our business could be materially harmed 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of april  contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands  operating leases      letters of credit   capital leases    restructuring liabilities   foreign currency exchange risk from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates in connection with the operations of our european subsidiaries 
while these instruments are subject to risk of loss from changes in exchange rates  those losses would generally be offset by gains on the related exposure 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we do not hedge against the euro 
we reduce the risks associated with changes in foreign currency rates by entering into forward  cylinder and option contracts to hedge accounts receivable denominated in currencies other than the euro 
gains and losses on contracts which hedge specific foreign currency denominated commitments are recognized in the period in which the transaction is completed 
in fiscal we incurred a net foreign exchange transaction loss of  compared to a transaction gain of  during fiscal the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is based on quoted market prices 
at april  we had no open foreign currency exchange contracts 
to the extent we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we limit our use of derivative financial instruments to the management of foreign currency risks 
we adopted sfas no 
on may   as required 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our financial statements 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which is included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also maintain an estimate of potential future product returns related to current period product receivables 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheets 
inventories 
inventories  which are predominantly finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
a detailed analysis of inventory is performed on a quarterly basis to identify unsold out of season fashion merchandise 
the net realizable value of the out of season merchandise is estimated based upon disposition plans and historical experience 
the carrying amount of out of season merchandise is reduced to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable

fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques

key variables in determining such estimates include the anticipated timing of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and estimates for brokerage and other related costs
