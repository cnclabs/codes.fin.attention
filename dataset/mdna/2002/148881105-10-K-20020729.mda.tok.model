overview catalyst semiconductor  inc  incorporated october   designs  develops and markets nonvolatile memory semiconductor products including serial and parallel eeproms  flash memory and mixed signal devices 
revenues are derived from sales of semiconductor products designed by us and manufactured by other companies 
our business is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns at various times which have been characterized by reduced product demand  production overcapacity and significant erosion of average selling prices 
throughout fiscal and fiscal  the market for certain flash and eeprom devices  which comprise the majority of our business  experienced an excess market supply relative to demand which resulted in a significant downward trend in prices 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we reduced our manufacturing costs  increased the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the selling prices for certain products that we produce increased  all contributing to the increased gross margin percentages 
during the second half of fiscal  we experienced cancellations of orders by our customers  increased supplies of competitive products  decreased prices and decreasing revenues 
revenues  gross profits  selling prices and net income continued to decline through the second quarter of fiscal in the second half of fiscal  quarterly revenues  gross profits and net income increased slightly 
we could  however  experience an increase in our manufacturing costs  a decrease in our unit shipments and a further downward trend in product pricing in the future  all factors which could adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues 
total revenues consist of net product sales 
a substantial portion of net product sales are made through independent distributors 
revenue from product sales to original equipment manufacturers and from sales to distributors who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights  is recognized upon shipment net of allowances for estimated returns 
when distributors have rights to return products or price protection rights  we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to the end customer 
total revenues decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of our eeprom products and price decreases caused by an excess supply of semiconductors and other unfavorable industry wide conditions 
shipments of our eeprom devices decreased by million to million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in the prior year 
the decrease was also attributable to the deteriorating market conditions 
shipments of our flash memory devices decreased by million to million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in the prior year 
the decrease in flash product sales was also attributable to the deteriorating market conditions 
shipments of our mixed signal products were million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in mixed signal product shipments was due to the limited number of products available for sale and because most of these products were introduced in fiscal international sales contributed of net product sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in percentage of international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to our increased sales in the far east due to increased 
table of contents market demand and our ability to be more competitive in the region as a result of certain cost reductions 
all sales of our products are in us dollars  minimizing the effects of currency fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million or a gross margin of compared to gross profit of million or a gross margin of for fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased selling prices and decreased revenues 
in fiscal  we benefited from the release of million in inventory reserves due to the sale of inventories previously reserved 
it is our policy to fully reserve all inventories that are not expected to be sold in a reasonable period of time from the balance sheet date  generally within the ensuing six or twelve months 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal was due to decreased selling prices and decreases in the level of sales of products with higher gross margins 
we pay certain foreign manufacturing expenses in local currency  primarily baht in thailand and yen in japan 
these expenses in foreign currencies are not material to us 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist principally of salaries for engineering  technical and support personnel  contract engineering services  depreciation of equipment and the cost of wafers used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
r d expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in wafers purchased for development purposes 
as of april   we employed people in research and development activities in addition to the equivalent of more at lxi  compared to employees plus under our informal arrangement with lxi as of april  as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses increased to from 
this increase in percentage was attributable to the decrease in revenues 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist principally of salaries for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities  professional fees and director and officer d o insurance 
sg a expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in personnel related expenses and a million decrease in commissions paid to outside representatives 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to from 
the reason for the increase in the percentage of revenue was the decrease in revenues 
net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  or of revenues in fiscal compared to net interest income of  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to the decreased interest rate paid on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was  or of earnings before taxes in fiscal compared to million or a provision for taxes in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate was due to the full utilization of loss carryforwards in fiscal and tax credits that were available as a result of credit carryforwards 
during fiscal  we generated new tax loss carryforwards and additional tax credits such that as of april   we had combined net operating loss carryforwards and r d and stock option related credit carryforwards totaling  for federal and state purposes  million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal of this total of million of tax credits  million is related to stock option credits which will reduce our tax payments but the benefit will be credited to stockholders equity rather than income when we conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be fully realizable 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our eeprom products and price increases caused by excess demand and other favorable industry wide conditions 
shipments of our eeprom devices increased by million to million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to improved market conditions and increased wafer supplies from our foundry service providers 
shipments of our flash memory devices increased by million to million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in the prior year 
the increase in flash product sales was attributable to increases in the quantity of 
table of contents units shipped and increases in the average selling price asp for such products 
international sales contributed of net product sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal all sales of our products were in us dollars 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million or a gross margin of compared to gross profit of million or a gross margin of for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased revenues  reduced production costs and increased selling prices 
we also benefited from the release of million in inventory reserves due to the sale of inventories previously reserved 
it is our policy to fully reserve all inventories that are not expected to be sold in a reasonable period of time from the balance sheet date 
the increase in gross margin percentage is due to increased selling prices  decreased price per unit assembly and testing costs and our increasing the level of sales of products with higher gross margins 
research and development 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel related expenses 
as of april   we employed people in research and development activities  compared to as of april  as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses decreased to from 
this decrease was attributable to the increase in revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in commissions paid to outside representatives  a million increase in personnel related expenses and million in additional provisions for uncollectable receivables 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to from 
the reason for the decrease in the percentage of sg a as a percentage of revenues is the increase in revenues 
net interest income and expense 
we had net interest income of  or of revenues in fiscal compared to net interest expense  or of revenues  in fiscal the change to net interest income from net interest expense is primarily attributable to increased interest earnings from the increased cash on hand and decreased borrowing from lenders 
the decrease in net interest expense as a percentage of revenues was attributable to decreased borrowing and the increase in revenues 
income tax provision 
the provision for income taxes was million or of earnings before taxes in fiscal compared to  or provision for taxes in fiscal during fiscal  we fully utilized the tax credits that were available as a result of previous years losses 
as of april  we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product shipments and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
specifically  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult judgments inventory reserves we record inventory reserves for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the cost of inventory estimated to be in excess based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual 
table of contents market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs are also required 
inventory reserves are also taken based upon our estimate of the future selling prices of our inventories 
whenever the estimated future selling price is less than the value of and the estimated cost to sell any portion of our inventory  a reserve is taken for the amount by which the cost of the inventory and costs to sell exceed the estimated future selling price 
if we overestimate the future selling prices  we will incur additional losses when the inventory is sold for a lower price or when we establish additional reserves to cover the even lower estimated sales price 
revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated based primarily upon historical experience and provided at the time of shipment 
for sales to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns  we recognize revenue at the time the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount  for a given period of time 
revenue is recognized when a distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
on our sales to end users  we record estimated reductions to revenue for the return of products at the time revenue is recognized 
if market conditions were to weaken  we may face higher volumes of product returns possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time products are returned 
if we were to experience an increased rate of product returns  our sales would be further reduced by the increased reserves taken to cover the increased amount of our products expected to be returned 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  we relieve inventory for the carrying value of the goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and we record the gross margin in deferred gross profit on shipments to distributors  a component of current liabilities on our balance sheet 
deferred margin represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of price concessions 
we do not reduce deferred margin by estimated future price concessions  instead  price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
the difference between deferred margin and the margin actually recognized has not been material in the past  however  since price concessions are highly dependent upon market conditions  there can be no assurance that the difference will not be material in the future 
price concessions are not granted for amounts in excess of the deferred margin 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation allowances we record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered estimated future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we are to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income and shareholders equity in the period such determination is made 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources total cash decreased million to million as of april  from million as of april  net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended april   which was due primarily to net income of  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of  an addition to the provision for doubtful accounts of  an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of  and a decrease in gross accounts receivable of million related to decreased sales and manufacturing activity  an increase in accounts payable of  related to our increased wafer purchases and an increase in other credits of million 
such increases were partially offset by an increase in gross inventories of  an increase in other current assets of  related to an expected refund of income taxes paid in a previous year and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
for the one year period ended april   net cash of million was provided by operations  principally by net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of  additions to the provision for doubtful accounts of  an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  million from the increase in accrued expenses  primarily due to the provision for income taxes and million from the increase in deferred gross profit on shipments to distributors 
such increase was partially offset by an increase in gross accounts receivable of  an increase in gross inventories of million due to the increase availability of wafers  plus million from the decrease in accounts payable due to the decreasing manufacturing activity 
our investing activities used  during the year ended april  and were related primarily to the acquisition of equipment for our manufacturing operations 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended april  was million which was primarily related to the purchase of equipment for our manufacturing operations 
financing activities used million during the year ended april   consisting primarily of million utilized for the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock   of which were repurchased in a private transaction and the remainder of which were open market purchases made through our announced open market repurchase program and approximately million was used to pay off the bank credit line and the remaining capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by the sale of common stock through the exercise of stock options totaled  during fiscal during the year ended april   the cash provided by financing activities was  primarily from  in proceeds from stock option exercises less  used to pay down our lease and bank obligations 
as of april   we were indebted to various creditors in the amount of approximately million 
this amount is comprised of approximately million for wafers and inventory processing and approximately million for other goods and services 
we do not have any material contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make any future payments other than with respect to the facilities lease for our principal business office in sunnyvale which will expire in further  we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions 
the following table shows the aggregate future minimum lease payments  by fiscal year  that we are obligated to pay under the terms of the non cancelable operating leases we currently have for our various facilities  principally our headquarters building in sunnyvale  california in thousands years ending operating april  leases 
table of contents in light of the current economic and competitive climate  we continue to monitor our liquidity resources 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
in our competitive industry  we must constantly consider the need to make significant expenditures in connection with our research and development efforts 
we may use cash to invest in businesses  products and or technologies which we believe to be strategic 
however  we have no present commitments or obligations with respect to any acquisition of other businesses or technology 
we have no present intention to seek additional debt or equity financing  but our need to do so is highly dependent upon factors such as the demand for our products and changes in industry and general economic conditions 
in the event that we do determine to seek such financing  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and any additional equity financing could result in incremental dilution to our existing investors 
effects of transactions with related parties during the fourth quarter of fiscal  catalyst began taking delivery of wafers fabricated at x fab texas  inc xfab  a wholly owned subsidiary of elex nv  a belgian holding company that owns of the outstanding shares of catalyst 
mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and ceo of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the wafers provided by xfab supplement the same designs fabricated at oki semiconductor in japan  our principal wafer fab since other than purchase orders currently open with xfab  there is no purchasing agreement in place with xfab 
each purchase order remains open until the wafers are delivered  which is generally within two months of placement of the order  although in the case of one particular wafer design  the purchase order calls for monthly deliveries over a one year period at a set price for each wafer delivered 
the prices of wafers purchased from xfab are determined by periodic negotiations with the management of xfab and compared to quotes obtained from other prospective wafer fabricators and pricing surveys published by various industry trade organizations 
during the year ended april   our purchases from xfab totaled million 
as of april   the total amount owed xfab was  we have had an informal arrangement since to obtain engineering services from lxi corporation  a california corporation lxi  a provider of engineering services through essex com srl essex  its wholly owned subsidiary in romania 
officers of catalyst  messrs 
vanco  voicu and gay own approximately  and  respectively  of lxi 
the number of full time engineers we use is dependent upon the scope and number of r d projects we have in process at a given time 
for example  during the month of april  essex employed the equivalent of approximately full time engineers to perform the services on our behalf 
these services relate to key development projects of catalyst including development  design  layout and test program development services 
we do not have any contractual commitment to obtain these services from lxi  nor does lxi have any obligation to provide these services to us 
during the fiscal year ended april  we recorded  of engineering fees from lxi for engineering design services provided to us by lxi 
as of april  the total amount owed to lxi was  one of our directors  mr 
lionel allan  also serves as a consultant to us through his consulting company  allan advisors  inc under the terms of his consulting agreement  we paid consulting fees of  per month throughout fiscal the consulting agreement will expire on august  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets including amortizable intangibles and is effective for fiscal years beginning december  as well as interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas no 
does not apply to the impairment of goodwill and non amortizable intangibles 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
certain risks that may affect our future results we desire to take advantage of certain provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  enacted in december the reform act that provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
we hereby caution stockholders  prospective investors in catalyst and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect  our stock price or cause our actual results for the fiscal year and quarter ending april  and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of us 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to many factors and are difficult to forecast 
our operating results have historically been and in future quarters may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as fluctuations in customer demand for our products  volatility in supply and demand affecting market prices generally such as the increases in supply of competitive products and significant declines in average selling prices experienced by us in the five quarters ended april  and during the fiscal years april  and  the need to establish additional inventory reserves due to the expected selling prices falling below the amounts paid to produce and sell certain parts  or if our expectations for sales of our inventory fall below the quantities that we have on hand  charges to bad debt expense caused by accounts receivable that become unlikely to be collected in a reasonable amount of time  if ever  the timing of new product introductions and significant orders of our products  increased expenses associated with new product introductions  process changes and or expanding our sales channels  gains or losses of significant customers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in our product mix  increases in wafer prices due to increased market demand and other factors  prices charged by our suppliers due to increased costs  decreased competition and other factors  foreign currency fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from a limited number of large orders and we expect that the timing of receipt and fulfillment of these orders may cause fluctuations which could be material to our operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast due to the previously described factors 
we base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations as to future revenue and our expenses are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if our expected revenue levels fall below our forecasts  as has occurred again during the most recent fiscal year  net income is likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because a proportionately smaller amount of our expenses vary with our revenue 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature 
we operate in a highly cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
this type of downturn occurred in calendar years and and again during we currently face and in the future may face diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and gross margins and production overcapacity during such downturns  which may last for more than a year 
accordingly  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
for example  we experienced accelerated erosion of average selling prices caused by adverse industry wide conditions during fiscal and throughout calendar year and incurred substantial losses during that period 
during fiscal  the semiconductor market rebounded from its cyclical decline which had a favorable impact on both our revenues and our gross margins into fiscal through the quarter ended october during each of the fiscal quarters ended january  april  july and october  however  the market for our products became more competitive as a result of increased availability of products when demand was decreasing 
since the twelve month period ended october  we have seen increased quarterly revenues but the rate of revenue growth that we experienced may not be sustained and could be reversed 
thus we are concerned about the ability of continued price and other competitive pressures to adversely affect our future operating results similar to the adverse affects on our and operating results 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors 
the improved market conditions we experienced in calendar year and the first ten months of calendar year have deteriorated significantly 
during the latter half of the fiscal year ended april  and in the first half of fiscal  we experienced decreases in orders from customers and found that lower selling prices were necessary to remain competitive in the market 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  market dynamics make our prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our customers products 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the current worldwide economic slowdown and  in the united states in particular  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict  but it may result in reductions in purchases of our products by our customers  longer sales cycles and increased price competition 
as a result  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for any given quarter in fiscal or for the entire year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our products fail to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose customers and revenue 
our product markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology and product obsolescence 
a key factor to our business success is the timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable us to achieve higher product densities and thereby reduce product costs 
for example  most of our products are currently designed and manufactured using a micron cmos 
table of contents eeprom process or a micron flash memory process 
we may not be able to select and develop new products and technologies and introduce them to the market in a timely manner and with acceptable fabrication yields and production costs 
furthermore  our products may not achieve market acceptance 
our failure to complete and introduce new products at competitive price performance levels could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by delays in developing new products  achievement of volume production of new products  successful completion of technology transitions with acceptable yields and reliability  or the lack of commercial acceptance of new products we introduce to the market 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for the supply of wafers 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
oki electric industry  co  ltd 
oki in japan has supplied wafers to us since and was our sole foundry source until the quarter ended april  at that time  an additional foundry  xfab  began to provide a limited number of products to us and the volumes currently provided by xfab are considerably less than oki currently provides 
we do not presently have a wafer supply agreement with oki or xfab and instead purchase wafers on a purchase order and acceptance basis 
our almost exclusive reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the risk of inadequate wafer supplies to meet our production needs  increased prices charged by such independent foundries  the unavailability of or interruption in access to required or more cost effective process technologies  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the risks associated with international operations more fully described below 
we are not always able to obtain sufficient increased quantities of wafers from oki to fulfill some of the current customer demand 
although we have a wafer purchase agreement with umc for certain flash products which runs through february  due to declining flash bookings and other circumstances  we have not ordered any wafers from umc since december on september   we announced an agreement with oki that resulted in a significant increase in foundry capacity available to us for a one year period that commenced in september in return for two payments totaling million 
these payments were added to the cost of inventories purchased during the ten month period ended march and were reflected in our cost of sales as the associated inventory was sold 
the last of the inventories associated with the payment for additional foundry capacity was sold in the quarter ended october as market conditions deteriorated before that inventory was sold we were expensing a portion of such payments during a period in which the selling price of that product decreased  adversely affecting our gross margins 
to address our wafer supply concerns  we plan to continue working on expanding our primary foundry capability at oki and our secondary foundry capability with xfab at its facility in lubbock  texas 
xfab is owned by elex nv which is a stockholder of the company as of july  and mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and ceo of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the addition of xfab as a second foundry source has enabled us to somewhat reduce the risks associated with the sourcing and quantity of our wafer supply and thereby improve control over an important component of our business  however  sufficient capacity may not be available from xfab 
additionally  oki may not continue to provide sufficient capacity in the future and that capacity may not be available from another manufacturer at prices acceptable to us 
even if such capacity is available  the qualification process and time required to make the foundry fully operational for us could take many months or longer and be subject to other factors described 
table of contents below and the prices could be materially higher 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of oki or xfab as a supplier  our inability to obtain additional capacity at oki or xfab  our inability to qualify xfab for additional products  our ability to qualify other wafer manufacturers for desired foundry capacity  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we have incurred significant losses or experienced significant negative cash flow from operations during several recent fiscal years 
we have incurred significant losses or experienced significant negative cash flow from operations during several recent fiscal years 
such negative cash flow during fiscal and significantly reduced our available capital 
during fiscal  we successfully took steps to address and resolve issues relating to our poor cash flow position 
during the fiscal year ended april   our cash on hand decreased by million  principally due to million in repurchases of our stock 
although as of april   we had cash on hand of million  we may not continue to generate sufficient revenue and profits to fund our operations 
we have pursued many measures designed to reduce expenses and conserve our cash in prior periods when we experienced decreased or negative cash flow and we continue to monitor expenses and to conserve our available cash 
however  to the extent we suffer any adverse effects to our revenues or margins because of delays in new product introductions  price competition or other competitive factors  our cash position and our business  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures although we have no present intention to do so 
if required  additional funding may not be available at acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution or the securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available to us or are not available on acceptable terms  further reductions in our operating expenses and capital expenditures may be required to continue operations  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 
our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
any shortfall in revenues or earnings from levels expected or projected by investors or others could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  affecting the market prices for many high technology companies and small capitalization companies and these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
the manufacture of semiconductor wafers is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors that may adversely affect our ability to generate future revenues 
the manufacture of semiconductor wafers for our products is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors typical in the semiconductor industry such as lower than anticipated production yields experienced by outside wafer foundries from time to time  incurring the time and expense to develop alternative foundry sources  experiencing substandard yield during the initial developmental stages of a new process  
table of contents inability to receive sufficient quantities of wafers at favorable prices on a timely basis  especially in periods of increased demand  material disruptions in the supply of wafers as a result of low manufacturing yield or other manufacturing problems  and production transition delays 
our ability to generate future revenues may be adversely affected by such delays and reductions that result in the cancellation of customer orders 
thus  any of the following events could delay shipments  result in the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results the loss of oki or xfab as a supplier  the failure to further develop xfab as a reliable foundry in an expeditious and cost effective manner  any prolonged inability to obtain adequate yields or deliveries from oki or xfab  and any other circumstance that would require us to seek and qualify alternative sources of supply of such products 
although we are exploring and seeking to develop alternative wafer supply sources such as xfab  we may not be able to obtain such alternative sources nor may we have adequate facilities available 
failure to have such supplies available would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition in our markets may lead to reduced average selling prices of our products  reduced sales of our products and reduced gross margins 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by rapid price erosion  declining gross margins  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and heightened international competition in many markets 
average selling prices in the semiconductor industry generally and  for our products in particular  have decreased significantly and rapidly over the life of each product 
we expect that average selling prices for our existing products will decline rapidly in the future and that average selling prices for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
declines in average selling prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the valuation of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  production  distribution and other resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our more mature products  such as serial and parallel eeprom devices  compete on the basis of product performance  price and customer service 
we believe that we compete successfully with respect to each of these factors  however price competition is significant and expected to continue 
principal competitors with respect to our eeprom products currently include stmicroelectronics  atmel  microchip  fairchild semiconductor and xicor  all of which have substantially greater resources than us 
the market for flash memory products has been characterized by long production cycles  irregular yields  competing technologies and  particularly since the first quarter of fiscal  intense price competition resulting in major reductions in average selling prices and corresponding reductions in margins 
our flash memory products compete on the basis of product performance  price and customer service 
however  given the development of higher density lower cost products and the intense price competition prevalent for these products  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against our competitors on the bases of these or other competitive factors 

table of contents we periodically experience an oversupply or shortage of wafer fabrication capacity due to volatile demand and thus we risk forecasting incorrectly and producing excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  which may adversely affect our results 
we have previously experienced periodic oversupply or shortages of wafer fabrication capacity due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
since we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  we risk forecasting incorrectly and producing excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
demand for our products is volatile and customers often place orders with short lead times 
the ability of our customers to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our wafer suppliers to match any customer changes and cancellations 
our inventory may not be reduced by the fulfillment of customer orders and in the future we may produce excess quantities of our products 
to the extent we produce excess inventories of particular products  our operating results could be adversely affected by charges to income that we would be required to recognize due to significant reductions in demand for our products or rapid declines in the market value of inventory  resulting in inventory writedowns or other related factors 
for example  during the last half of fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million due to the rapid decrease in demand for and the selling prices of our products 
such adjustments amounted to less than million in fiscal and were not material in fiscal inventory reserve adjustments in fiscal totaled million which were partially offset by the release of million of inventory reserves taken in previous periods relating to products that were sold during fiscal during fiscal  the net effect of inventory reserve adjustments was minimal 
in addition  in fiscal and to some extent during fiscal and fiscal  our ability to forecast future demand and selling prices diminished 
it is our policy to fully reserve all inventories that we do not expect to be sold in a reasonable period of time from the balance sheet date  generally within the ensuing six or twelve months 
during most of our recent fiscal periods  as a result of reductions in estimated demand for our various products  we have provided additional reserves for excess quantities and obsolescence for certain products  primarily our flash and eeprom products 
in fiscal  the rapid erosion of selling prices also left us with significant amounts of inventory with a carrying value that exceeded its current selling price resulting in adjustments to the carrying value of the inventory to the lower of cost or market value 
we may suffer similar reductions in values of our inventories in the future and we may be unable to liquidate our inventory at acceptable prices 
we rely on outside providers of engineering services and the loss of these services may cause a significant interruption in our supply of engineering resources 
to supplement our limited engineering staff dedicated to product research and development activities  we utilize the services of various outside semiconductor design services 
the most significant is an informal arrangement we have had in place since to obtain engineering services from lxi corporation lxi of which our officers messrs 
vanco  voicu and gay own approximately  and  respectively 
lxi provides these services through essex com srl essex  its wholly owned subsidiary in romania 
the aggregate number of hours of engineering services provided to us varies by quarter 
during the month of april  essex employed the equivalent of approximately full time engineers to perform services relating to key development projects including development  design  layout and test program development services 
because we do not have a formal contractual arrangement with lxi  lxi is not obligated to perform these services 
there is no guarantee that lxi will continue to supply a sufficient number of engineers to fulfill our requirements for outsourced engineering services and we may not be able to procure engineering services from an additional source in a timely manner or at comparable rates 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of lxi as a supplier of outsourced engineering services and  to a lesser extent  the loss of our other providers of outsourced engineering services  our inability to obtain comparable new suppliers of such services  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of engineering resources

we may not be able to sustain market acceptance for our flash memory products 
a significant amount of our net revenues have been and continue to be derived from sales of flash memory products 
flash memory products represented of our shipments during the fiscal year ended april  and represented  and of our shipments  respectively  in each of fiscal years  and the market for flash memory products has been characterized by intense price competition  long production cycles  inconsistent yields  competing technologies  rapidly declining average selling prices  declines in gross margins and intense overall competition 
our operating results in fiscal and were adversely affected by intense price competition caused by increased supplies of products and other adverse industry wide conditions 
intel and other competitors which include advanced micro devices  atmel  fujitsu  hitachi  micron  mitsubishi  stmicroelectronics  sharp  texas instruments and toshiba are expected to further increase flash memory production 
most of these competitors are manufacturing and selling devices with larger memories which are utilized in more recently developed products such as digital cameras 
due to intense competition  limited development resources and other factors  we have decided not to develop any of the higher density flash memory devices at this time 
we may not be able to sustain the market acceptance for our flash memory products 
we anticipate continued price and other competitive pressures  which adversely affected our fiscal and operating results  to adversely affect our future operating results 
we rely on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble  test and ship our products to customers 
we outsource portions of our planning  finish work and test functions for certain products  as well as our inventory management shipping and receiving function to subcontractors who are primarily located in thailand and the philippines 
this reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and currency risks 
such risks could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our customer relationships and result in lower profitability 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
for the fiscal year ended april   international sales comprised of our product sales 
additionally  for fiscal  and  international sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales 
the lower percentage in international sales in was primarily attributable to the transition in japan from marubun corporation  our former distributor which resigned in fiscal  to various smaller alternative distributors that serve similar markets and our inability to compete with the low selling prices in certain far east markets 
in fiscal  we were able to reenter certain far east markets  contributing to the increased international sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our product sales in the future 
however  our international operations may be adversely affected by the following factors greater fluctuations in demand for our products due to the increased sensitivity to pricing changes in certain markets  particularly the far east  fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  political and financial instability  trade restrictions  changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents difficulties in staffing international operations  and longer payment cycles 
currently  all our sales are invoiced and paid in us dollars  reducing our direct exposure to currency fluctuations 
recently  several customers in europe have requested that we develop the ability to invoice them in euros 
except for yoshikawa semiconductor in japan  a provider of wafer sorting services and certain contract personnel costs and incidental manufacturing supply purchases in thailand  over of our purchases are in us dollars  minimizing any direct currency fluctuation risk 
our business however  is subject to other risks generally associated with doing business with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to foreign government regulations and political and financial unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by these or other factors related to our international operations 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue in the past and the loss of one or more of our current customers  additional volume pricing arrangements or an early termination or delay in shipments can affect our results adversely 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue in the past 
for the fiscal year ended april   sales to future electronics  inc  a worldwide distributor  represented of our revenues 
for the fiscal year ended april   sales to future electronics  inc represented of our revenues 
for the fiscal year ended april   sales to memec asia pacific ltd  a distributor in asia  future electronics  inc and yosun industrial corp  a reseller located in taiwan  each represented more than of our revenues  and respectively 
in addition  we have experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to significant customers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
we also do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contact  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer and it may be difficult to replace that revenue source in the short term upon cancellation 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our current customers  additional volume pricing arrangements  an early termination or delay in shipments by one of our major customers 
we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested due to the constraints in our wafer supply 
due to the constraints in our wafer supply  from time to time we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested 
although we strive to increase our supply of wafers and communicate to our customers the scheduled delivery dates that we believe that we can reasonably expect to meet  our customers may not accept the alternative delivery date or may seek to cancel their outstanding orders 
this would result in lower revenues and profits  excess inventories and increased inventory reserves 
our operating results have historically been and in future quarters may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as timing of new product introductions and announcements by us and our competitors  fluctuations in customer demand for our products  volatility in supply and demand affecting market prices generally such as the increases in supply of competitive products and significant declines in average selling prices experienced by us in recent fiscal years 
we rely upon our intellectual property and proprietary technology and may receive notices from time to time that allege we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
in the semiconductor industry  companies place extensive reliance upon their intellectual property and proprietary technology and it is typical for companies to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
for example  we were served with a 
table of contents complaint alleging that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of xicor  inc  a maker of nonvolatile memory products 
we entered into a settlement agreement with xicor in june pursuant to which we have received a license to manufacture the disputed products in exchange for certain royalty payments to xicor in connection with shipments of certain of our digital potentiometer products made subsequent to july   the date on which the complaint was dismissed 
we may receive other notices and or become a party to proceedings alleging our infringement of intellectual property rights in the future 
such claims  if successful  could require us to pay royalties on previous sales of the products which are alleged to infringe 
additionally  in such event  we may not be able to obtain any required licenses of third party intellectual property rights or be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
failure to obtain such a license in any event could require us to cease production of our products until we develop a non infringing design or process 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the cost of litigation of any such claim or resulting damage award 
please see note contingencies contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements item legal proceedings in this report on form k for additional information 
our securities are traded in a limited market 
our common stock was traded on the nasdaq national market from may until it was delisted in august for sustained trading below the minimum level of per share required by the nasdaq stock exchange for continued listing 
our stock was traded on the over the counter bulletin board market until september  when we were re listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the over the counter market was generally less visible to investors and therefore we were unable to meet the liquidity requirements of some major commercial  institutional and private investors thus limiting the market for our securities 
we submitted a request on october  that our securities be listed on the national market  but due to general market and other conditions  our stock subsequently closed below the price per share which is required to qualify for national market listing and nasdaq closed the listing application 
we intend to reapply for nasdaq national market listing if and when our shares trade for an extended period above the level  but we are unable to ascertain the amount of time nasdaq will take to consider such application  if nasdaq will reply favorably to such application or  if additional information is requested  how much time and effort will be required on our part to adequately demonstrate and verify our qualifications 
our backlog may not result in future revenue  which may adversely affect our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue could harm our business 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
our ability to operate successfully will depend  to a large extent  upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly for highly skilled design  process and test engineers  is intense and we may not be able to retain such personnel or attract other highly qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of or failure to attract and retain any such highly qualified personnel 
we depend on manufacturers representatives and distributors to distribute our products 
we market and distribute our products primarily through manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
our distributors typically offer competing products 
the distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
our operating results could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more manufacturers representatives or distributors  or the decision by one or more distributors to reduce the number of our products offered by such distributors or to carry the product lines of our competitors 

table of contents we may not be able to expand our proprietary technology if we do not acquire rights to use key technologies  consummate potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or consummate transactions with such candidates  the failure of which could slow our growth strategy 
we may also have difficulty in acquiring licenses to use proprietary technologies of third parties to expand our product lines 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies of any acquisition we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
our operations could be harmed by earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
additionally  our principal wafer supplier  oki  is located in japan which is also subject to the risk of business disruption by earthquakes 
our operations could be harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters or other key areas of the world 
we may not carry adequate insurance coverage to protect our business from certain types of loss 
although we carry general comprehensive liability insurance and other types of insurance coverages typical for most publicly traded companies  the insurance coverage we retain may not cover the specific damages that we incur 
for example  we do not carry earthquake insurance coverage and our commercial coverage does not include protection for lost profits 
consequently  our business may not be protected if we incur losses of a type for which we do not retain coverage 
additionally  disputes with our carriers regarding policy coverages might occur which could mean that we would be unable to recover all of our damages in the event of a loss 
such occurrences could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a change of control may be delayed by resistive measures adopted by us 
our stockholder rights plan  which provides stockholders with certain rights to acquire shares of common stock in the event a third party acquires more than of our stock  our board s ability to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval and our staggered terms for our directors  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations are not currently subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to us to date
