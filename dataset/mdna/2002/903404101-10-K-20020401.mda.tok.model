we expect our revenues in the future  especially from corporate and professional clients  to be dependent in large part on our ability to establish relationships with partners that integrate and market our services as part of their own product and service offerings 
we have little or no influence over the marketing efforts of these partners and the success of the products and services offered by them 
our partners are generally under no minimum payment obligations

general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to severance payments made to certain terminated executives in the first quarter of and significant decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses as well as amounts paid to outside consultants

during we were not in compliance with certain covenants in our loan and security agreement 
the bank agreed to suspend financial covenant compliance and forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the loan agreement  including termination of the agreement  until february  on april   we entered into an agreement with the bank to amend our september loan and security agreement amendment number one

since inception we have experienced negative cash flows from operations 
we have a working capital deficit of million and an accumulated deficit of million as of december  based on our current operating plans  management believes existing cash resources  including the proceeds from the january and march convertible notes  cash forecasted by management to be generated by operations and proceeds from the april bank financing arrangement will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital requirements through december  also  management s plans to attain profitability and generate additional cash flows include  increasing revenues from enterprise and consumer services  focus on cost reductions and operational efficiencies to be derived from further deployment of us search s technologies  and the launch of additional products 
there is no assurance that management will be successful with these plans 
however  if events and circumstances occur such that us search does not meet its current operating plan as expected  and us search is unable to raise additional financing  us search may be required to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on us search s ability to achieve our intended business objectives

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
capitalized software and development costs 
our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense recognition or capitalization 
the company capitalizes costs of software  consulting services  hardware and payroll related costs incurred to purchase and develop internal use software 
the company expenses costs incurred during the preliminary project assessment  research and development  reengineering  training and application maintenance phases 
acquired intangibles 
our business acquisition resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
legal contingencies 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while the outcome of these matters are difficult to predict  we currently believe that the loss  if any  from these proceedings will not materially exceed the amount we have accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
however there is no assurance that such amounts accrued will be adequate to cover such losses upon final resolution of these matters
