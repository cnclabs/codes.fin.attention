item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general corporate history 
we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gbc delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
business history 
we are engaged in the development of proprietary drug delivery technology 
our principal business focus has been to develop a technology for buccal delivery absorption through the inner cheek walls of large molecule drugs  ie  drugs composed of molecules with molecular weights above a specified level 
large molecule drugs historically have been administered only by injection because their size inhibits or precludes absorption if administered by oral  transdermal  transnasal or other means 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada and europe 
in september  we entered into an agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company 
under this agreement  lilly is responsible for conducting clinical trials of the product  securing regulatory approvals and marketing on a worldwide basis 
lilly also has the option to develop certain additional products using our buccal delivery technology depending on the success of the initial product 
we received  in connection with our entry into the agreement and will receive certain other initial fees and milestone payments subject to the attainment of certain product development milestones  as well as royalty payments based on product sales should any products be approved for commercial sale 
lilly also has the option to develop certain additional products using our buccal delivery technology depending on the success of the initial product 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owed subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan 
the joint venture will pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
in january of  the parties expanded the joint venture to include buccal morphine for the management of pain and selected buccal morphine as the initial product for development under generex bermuda ltd 
this expansion of the joint venture occurred after we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of morphine delivery using our proprietary buccal delivery technology 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of a new series of our preferred stock  designated as series a preferred stock  for  we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
while we initially own of the joint venture entity  eis has the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase its ownership up to by exchanging the series a preferred stock for of our interest in the joint venture entity 
in january of  pursuant to the terms of the agreement with eis  eis received a stock dividend of series a preferred stock 
generex bermuda  ltd 
was granted non exclusive licenses to utilize our buccal delivery technology and certain elan drug delivery technologies 
using the funds from its initial capitalization  generex bermuda  ltd 
paid a non refundable license fee of  to elan in consideration for being granted the rights to utilize the elan drug delivery technologies 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we may use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones  we may require eis to purchase an additional  of our common stock at a premium to the then prevailing fair market value of our common stock 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from product sales in the current fiscal year 
we expect  however  to satisfy all of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through prior equity financing 
restatement subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended july   management determined that its series a preferred stock should be reclassified from stockholders equity  in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  because the redemption feature of the series a preferred stock is beyond the control of the company 
this restatement did not affect net loss for the year ended july   nor did it affect total assets 
the series a preferred stock should have been included outside the statement of stockholders equity from the date of its issuance in january results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fy compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fy 
the net loss for fy excludes  in preferred stock dividend on preferred shares 
the decrease in our fy net loss resulted from o decreases in research and development expenses to  from  and o decreases in general and administrative expenses to  from the decrease in our expenses was partially offset by a decrease in interest and other income 
our interest and miscellaneous income net of income expense in fy decreased to  from  in fy due to decreases in our cash and short term investments 
we did not receive any revenues in fy in fy  we received  in revenue from our agreement with lilly 
the principal reasons for the decrease in our research and development expense from to resulted from the accounting treatment for our joint venture with elan  which resulted in a  research and development expense for the license fee paid by generex bermuda ltd 
to elan for technology rights in the company s consolidated net loss  which includes this expense  however  was partially offset by approximately million of minority interest  reflecting elan s ownership interest in the joint venture our general and administrative expenses decreased due to reductions in various categories of these expenses  including o a reduction of approximately  in financial services expenses  principally due to a decrease in the number and value of compensatory warrants and options issued  and o a reduction of approximately  in the amount of consulting fees paid 
our expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in executive compensation of approximately  and small increases in other expense categories 
in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fy and  in fy were paid partially through the issuance of shares of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
in addition  in fy  the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  was  as compared to a  minority interest share of loss in fy results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  in the year ended july  fy compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fy 
the increase in our fy net loss resulted from increases in research and development expenses to  from  and in general and administrative expenses to  from 
our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fy increased to  from  in fy the accounting treatment of the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  resulted in a  minority interest share of loss 
in addition  we received  in revenues in connection with the agreement with lilly 
the principal reasons for the increase in our research and development expense in fy were o the accounting treatment for our joint venture with elan  which resulted in a  research and development expense for the license fee paid by generex bermuda ltd 
to elan for technology rights the company s consolidated net loss  which includes this expense  however  was partially offset by approximately million of minority interest  reflecting elan s ownership interest in the joint venture  and o increased expenditures relating to clinical studies of our oral insulin formulation 
the principal reasons for the increase in our general and administrative expenses in fy were o expenses incurred in connection with the termination in august of the equity line facility  pursuant to which the company paid  to tradersbloom limited   to ladenburg thalman co  and expensed the deferred financing costs the fair value of the warrants  approximately  all of which were included in fy  o increased travel and other costs of  to  from  associated with attendance at and sponsorship of industry seminars and exhibitions and other promotional activities  o an increase of  in legal and accounting fees and expenses to  from  related primarily to legal and accounting services in connection with reporting requirements under the securities and exchange act of  litigation defense costs and increased legal activity necessitated by increased equity financing and business activity  o increased personnel costs of  to  from  related primarily to additions in our technical and administrative staff during fy  and o expenses associated with the annual meeting of stockholders 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations o impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property and equipment may not be recoverable under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred based upon expected future cash flows  the loss is recognized on the statement of operations 
o intangible assets 
the company has intangible assets related to patents 
the determination of the related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
in assessing the recoverability of these intangible assets  the company uses an estimate of undiscounted operating income and related cash flow over the remaining useful life  market conditions and other factors to determine the recoverability of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment changes for these assets not previously recorded 
o estimating accrued liabilities  specifically litigation accruals 
management s current estimated ranges of liabilities related to pending litigation are based on management s best estimate of future costs 
while the final resolution of the litigation could result in amounts different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on the company s consolidated financial results in a future reporting period  management believes the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our development stage activities primarily through private placements of common stock 
in fy  we granted stock options  warrants and shares of common stock to consultants  advisors and employees with a value of  for services rendered  all of which are included in general and administrative expenses 
in september  we began a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock from the open market 
through july   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock to be held in treasury for  at an average price of per share 
notwithstanding the repurchase of  shares of common stock  our net loss resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity to  at july   versus  at july  at july   we had on hand cash and short term investments primarily notes of us corporations of approximately million versus approximately million at july  we believe that our current cash position is sufficient to meet all of our working capital needs for at least the next months 
beyond that  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise funds through private or public equity financing or from other sources 
if we were unable to raise additional capital as needed  we could be required to scale back or otherwise revise our business plan 
any significant scale back of operations or modification of our business plan due to a lack of funding could be expected to materially and adversely affect our prospects 
in the past we have funded most of our development and other costs with equity financing 
while we have been able to raise equity capital as required  unforeseen problems with our clinical program or materially negative developments in general economic conditions could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital as needed  or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such capital is available 
transactions with affiliates on may   the company s three senior officers  who are also shareholders of the company  were advanced  each  in exchange for promissory notes 
these notes bore interest at percent per annum and were payable in full on may  these notes were guaranteed by a related company owned by these officers and secured by a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock owned by this related company 
on june   the company s board of directors extended the maturity date of the loans to october  the other terms and conditions of the loans and guaranty remained unchanged and in full force and effect 
as of july   the balance outstanding on these notes  including accrued interest  was  subsequent to july   pursuant to a decision made as of august   these loans were satisfied by application of pledged stock  at a value of per share  which represented the lowest closing price during the sixty days prior to august  prior to january   a portion of our general and administrative expenses resulted from transactions with affiliated persons  and a number of capital transactions also involved affiliated persons 
although these transactions were not the result of arms length negotiations  we do not believe that this fact had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
prior to december   we classified certain payments to executive officers for compensation and expense reimbursements as research and development related party because the executive officers received such payments through personal services corporations rather than directly 
after december   these payments have been and will continue to be accounted for as though the payments were made directly to the officers  and not as a related party transaction 
we do not foresee a need for  and therefore do not anticipate  any related party transactions in the current fiscal year
