item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of ralcorp holdings  inc company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under item  especially note  and the cautionary statement on forward looking statements on page significant changes to the company s business mix and nonrecurring events that have been recorded over the last three years affect the comparisons of fiscal   and operations 
consequently  comparative results are more difficult to analyze and explain 
where practicable  this discussion addresses not only the financial results as reported  but also the key results and factors affecting ralcorp s on going businesses 
recently issued accounting standards see note to the financial statements in item for a discussion regarding recently issued accounting standards  including fas        and  sab  and eitf    and results of operations consolidated net sales net sales grew from million in fiscal to nearly billion in and nearly billion in the increase from to and the increase from to were due primarily to the timing of business acquisitions 
refer to the segment discussions below for specific factors affecting results 
operating expenses the following table shows operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
year ended september  net sales cost of products sold selling  general and administrative earnings before interest  nonrecurring items  income taxes and equity earnings as acquisitions have continued to change the company s business mix  the percentage of sales figures have changed  reflecting the lower gross margin and operating cost structure of the snack nuts candy and dressings  syrups  jellies sauces businesses 
the three year gross margin trend was also affected by the temporary ingredient and labor cost increases within the snack nuts operation in fiscal and the competitive pricing pressures in fiscal in fiscal  gross margins increased as a result of improved operating efficiencies in the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces division and lower ingredient costs in the snack nuts candy division 
the declining trend in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses can be partially attributed to the ability of the cereals  crackers cookies operations to grow their revenue bases while keeping their overall cost structure relatively stable 
in addition  in fiscal the company adopted fas which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
all considered  the percentage for cost of products sold is expected to decline slightly in fiscal primarily as a result of the sale of the unprofitable honey and ketchup businesses and the inclusion of a full year of results from the lofthouse business and the sg a percentage is expected to remain around percent 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased from million in to million in  as long term debt increased from million at the beginning of fiscal to million by september  and decreased only slightly to million by september  the increased debt levels were primarily the result of borrowings to fund business acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of receivables at the end of fiscal net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal as a result of lower debt levels and lower interest rates 
ralcorp reduced its long term debt to million by september  as cash from operations exceeded cash needs for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
since the company s interest rates are set on a short term basis  the declining market rates throughout fiscal and 
table of contents had a favorable effect on interest expense 
similarly  the company expects to benefit from low rates in fiscal if short term rates remain favorable 
plant closure and relocation costs on july   the company announced its plan to close the baltimore  md plant of its dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment and move production to its dunkirk  ny facility 
in conjunction with this plan  the company recorded charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the amount of million related to termination benefits for production employees and administrative employees and a write down of assets to be sold 
on january   the company announced its plan to close the san jose  ca plant of its dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment and move production to its other facilities 
both of these closures were essentially completed by the end of fiscal during  additional baltimore closure and relocation costs of million were expensed along with 
million related to san jose  for a total of million 
for more information  including related liabilities recorded through purchase accounting  see note to the financial statements in item income taxes income tax provisions generally reflect statutory tax rates  adjusted by the effects of non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
the effective rate for fiscal is lower than in fiscal and because the company has not recorded goodwill amortization expense since its adoption of fas on october  equity in earnings of vail resorts  inc the company s pre tax earnings from vail were million for fiscal and improved to million for fiscal  as snowfall amounts and timing were favorable 
for fiscal  ralcorp recorded a pre tax loss of million from its investment in vail 
that loss included adjustments totaling million to reflect the cumulative effect of vail s earnings restatements for prior years  driven primarily by a change in accounting for initiation fees related to the sale of memberships in its private clubs 
the adjustments had no effect on earnings before equity earnings or food business ebitda 
cereals  crackers cookies fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up million in fiscal from fiscal  as the ralston foods cereal division and the bremner cracker and cookie division contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
while most of bremner s growth came from the addition of the lofthouse business  acquired january   sales at its other cookie businesses grew more than percent as a result of additional co manufacturing business and ongoing expansion with existing private label customers 
cracker sales volumes were down slightly due to lower demand for saltines 
at ralston foods  incremental sales to existing customers  driven by several recent product introductions and additional distribution of established items  were offset by price concessions  additional product promotions  and less co manufacturing business 
ready to eat rte cereal volumes were up percent from last year and hot cereal volume was up percent 
profit contribution for the segment increased million from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal again  most of the improvement was the result of the acquired lofthouse business and related synergies 
in addition  the segment s profit was reduced by million in fiscal  while goodwill was not amortized in fiscal due to the adoption of fas finally  in fiscal the segment benefited from favorable volumes  plant efficiencies  and lower freight and energy costs  greatly offset by price concessions  promotional programs and rising ingredient costs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment improved million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal  as the ralston foods cereal division and the bremner cracker and cookie operation contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
most of the improvements at ralston foods were the result of new product offerings and increased distribution with several key customers 
despite an industry decline in the overall rte cereal category  ralston foods fiscal base store brand rte cereal volume  excluding co manufacturing  increased more than percent from fiscal average rte prices declined during fiscal due to competitive pricing pressures  but showed slight improvement in the fourth quarter 
volume under rte co manufacturing agreements in fiscal was nearly double the volume of fiscal  but lower pricing partially offset the impact on net sales 
ralston foods hot cereal sales were up percent year over year as a result of favorable product mix 
bremner cracker volumes improved percent in fiscal  while cookie volumes were up percent as a result of new customer sales 
the impact on net sales dollars was not as great since much of the new volume consisted of lower priced sandwich cr me cookies 
in addition to improved sales from its pre existing 
table of contents cracker and cookie businesses  bremner benefited from a full year of revenue from cascade cookie company in fiscal  acquired on january  fiscal profit contribution for the cereals  crackers cookies segment was up percent from fiscal profit was hurt by reduced margins caused by competitive pricing pressures and higher energy and packaging costs 
these negative effects were more than offset by lower ingredient costs  improved production efficiencies due to increased volumes  and the continued focus on aggressive cost containment 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces the company s dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment  also known as the carriage house companies  inc  is comprised of martin gillet co  inc  acquired at the beginning of march  the red wing company  inc  acquired on july   and the torbitt castleman company  llc  acquired january  the segment s net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in and in the increases were primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions as noted above 
fiscal included martin gillet s results for the full year and two and a half months of results from red wing 
fiscal included a full year of martin gillet and red wing and eight months from torbitt castleman 
fiscal included a full year of results from all of the component businesses 
in a comparison of actual fiscal results to pro forma fiscal results including actual red wing results for the full year and actual torbitt results for february through september  sales volumes were up percent  but corresponding net sales dollars  which were negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures and product mix in the first half of the year  were down percent 
in fiscal  the favorable impact of sales to new customers and increased business with some major existing customers was offset by pricing concessions in certain categories and a reduction of volume with a co manufacturing customer 
the segment s profit contribution increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the dollar increase from year to year is again partially attributable to the timing of acquisitions 
profit as a percent of sales was reduced in fiscal and the first half of fiscal by lower sales volumes  competitive pricing pressures  higher energy and packaging costs  and incremental expenses associated with integrating the three companies 
during the second half of fiscal  profit as a percent of sales improved to as the segment benefited from savings from the closure of the two facilities and additional synergies with torbitt castleman 
those savings and synergies continued into fiscal  but the benefits were offset by a gross margin decline due to increased ingredient costs  lower co manufacturing volumes  and competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  the segment s profit was reduced by million and million of goodwill amortization expense in fiscal and  respectively  while goodwill was not amortized in fiscal due to the adoption of fas snack nuts candy net sales for the snack nuts candy segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  then decreased to million in fiscal fiscal included only months of results from james p 
linette  inc  a chocolate candy manufacturer acquired on may  excluding the sales contribution of the linette business  snack nut sales declined from to as a result of a reduction in sales to a major customer 
the decline was the result of the loss of a few customers in competitive bidding  partially offset by increased business with continuing customers 
the segment s profit contribution increased from million of net sales in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal and percentages improved as a result of favorable ingredient costs  specifically cashew costs which have trended down from significant highs in fiscal in addition  a plant closure in fiscal caused initial inefficiencies related to the relocation of production lines in that year  but fiscal and benefited from the resulting manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings 
finally  the segment s profit was reduced by million and million of goodwill amortization expense in fiscal and  respectively  while goodwill was not amortized in fiscal due to the adoption of fas liquidity and capital resources the company s businesses have historically focused on generating positive cash flows through operations 
management believes that the company will continue to generate operating cash flows through its mix of businesses and expects that short term and long term liquidity requirements will be met through a combination of operating cash flows and strategic use of borrowings under committed and uncommitted credit arrangements 
capital 
table of contents resources remained strong at september  with a net worth of million and a long term debt to total capital ratio of percent 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operations were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
operating cash flows  which are primarily affected by cash earnings and changes in working capital  were augmented in fiscal by million of proceeds from the sale of receivables in september 
see note to the financial statements in item for more information about the company s three year agreement to sell its receivables on an ongoing basis 
cash earnings net earnings before depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  equity earnings and other noncash items have been growing along with the company  from million in to million in and million in from a cash flow standpoint  this growth in cash earnings was offset in and by increases in working capital  excluding the effects of acquisitions  of million and million  respectively 
much of the large fiscal increase was the result of a normal seasonal inventory build up at red wing s tomato paste production facility which occurred after the acquisition of red wing 
working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was million at september  compared to million and million at september  and  respectively 
excluding the effects of acquisitions and the net payments related to the sale of receivables  working capital decreased million during fiscal emphasis on working capital reduction resulted in lower inventory levels and improved collection times of accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of purchases 
cash flows from investing activities net cash paid for business acquisitions totaled million in fiscal lofthouse foods  million in fiscal torbitt castleman  and million in fiscal ripon foods  cascade  linette and red wing 
see note to the financial statements in item for more information about acquisitions

capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to approach million 
in fiscal  ralcorp received million of proceeds from the sale of its carriage house facility in san jose  ca  with no material gain or loss 
cash flows from financing activities ralcorp borrowed million under various credit agreements during fiscal to fund acquisitions as noted above 
strong operating cash flows and reduced acquisition activity allowed the company to reduce its long term debt in fiscal and by million and million  respectively

the company repurchased million of its common stock during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s board of directors approved an authorization to buy back up to two million shares of the company s common stock from time to time as management determines 
in february  the board approved an authorization to buy back an additional one million shares 
as of september    shares remained available for repurchase by the company pursuant to those authorizations 
in november  the board approved a tender offer for up to  shares at a single price not in excess of and not less than per share 
the offer was in the form of a modified dutch auction where the final price is determined based upon the number of shares  and the respective prices  tendered 
the offer resulted in the purchase of million shares at a purchase price of per share 

table of contents outlook cereals  crackers cookies the level of competition in the cereal category continues to be intense 
competition comes from branded box cereal manufacturers  branded bagged cereal producers and other private label cereal providers 
for the last several years  category growth in ready to eat and hot cereals has been minimal  which has added to its competitive nature 
when branded competitors focus on price promotion  the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging 
ralston foods must maintain an effective price gap between its quality private label cereal products and those of branded cereal producers  thereby providing the best value alternative for the consumer 
cost increases  including recent increases in ingredient costs  contribute to margin pressures 
ralston foods manages these cost increases by selected forward purchasing and hedging of certain ingredients 
increased employee health care and other benefit costs are likely to continue into the foreseeable future 
accordingly  aggressive cost containment remains an important goal of the organization 
in addition  increased distribution is required to remain competitive whether through new and improved product emulations or new co manufacturing opportunities 
the company s cracker and cookie operation  bremner  also conducts business in a highly competitive category and is affected by many of the same cost challenges 
major branded competitors continue to market and promote their offerings aggressively and many smaller  regional branded and private label manufacturers provide additional competitive pressures 
bremner s ability to maintain a sufficient price gap between products of branded producers and bremner s quality private label emulations and its ability to realize improved operating efficiencies from recent acquisitions will be important to its results of operations 
the division continues its effort to maximize synergies through the combination of lofthouse with cascade  which has given bremner a significant presence in the in store bakery cookie category 
in addition  bremner will continue to focus on cost containment  new products and volume growth of existing products in order to improve operating results 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces operation started fiscal in transition 
the consolidation of its baltimore operation into the dunkirk facility was completed in january a second plant closure  in san jose  ca  was completed in january and all related production has been moved to other carriage house facilities 
these measures have improved the profit contribution of carriage house 
the acquisition of the wet products portion of torbitt castleman on january  has provided carriage house with additional scale and manufacturing flexibility 
carriage house s competitors  both large and small  continue to be very aggressive on pricing 
in addition  the division is also being negatively affected by ingredient cost increases as well as increased employee health care and benefit costs 
adding to these difficulties  union employees of the division s fredonia and dunkirk  ny plants were on strike from november to november  on november   ralcorp issued a press release indicating that based on information currently available  the company expects that  without taking into account any effect of the strike  carriage house s earnings for the first quarter of fiscal will be significantly below those reported for the same period last year and could be break even or a modest loss 
carriage house sold product to a branded company under several co manufacturing agreements  the last of which expired in november these contracts accounted for approximately percent of the segment s fiscal net sales and a greater percentage of its operating profit 
however  the company expects that the effect of these lost sales on net earnings will not be material to ralcorp as a whole 
management has undertaken an aggressive plan to improve performance by selling unprofitable businesses and continuing to rationalize production capacity 
in june  the company sold its honey operations 
in september  the company announced its intention to significantly reduce operations at the streator  il facility and move production to other facilities 
in november  the company sold its ketchup operations 
costs associated with the streator reorganization and the sale of the ketchup business  including employee severance costs and write off of equipment  are estimated at million and will be recognized in the first half of fiscal increasing sales to new and existing customers  integrating product offerings of the combined organizations  further cost reductions  and capturing of additional synergies will continue to be critical objectives 

table of contents the cost of peanuts  a major ingredient for carriage house peanut butter  has been favorably impacted by the farm bill which was signed into law in may although the company expects to benefit from lower peanut costs in fiscal  the effect on profit cannot be quantified at this time 
as discussed in note to the financial statements in item  the fair value of the carriage house reporting unit only slightly exceeded its carrying value as of june  in accordance with the provisions of fas  the company will monitor this unit closely to determine whether circumstances change that would reduce its fair value below its carrying amount 
for example  fair value would be diminished if the forecasted benefits of the cost reduction plans discussed above are not realized  or are negated by lost customers or pricing pressures  and the unit is not able to achieve its planned results 
if the fair value drops below the carrying value  carriage house goodwill would likely be impaired and an impairment loss would be recorded immediately as a charge against earnings 
snack nuts candy snack nuts and candy continue to be very competitive categories 
this segment of ralcorp faces significant competition from branded manufacturers as well as private label and regional producers 
during fiscal  competitive bids for store brand customer business resulted in either loss of margins or loss of customers to competitors 
management expects this margin pressure to continue into the foreseeable future 
the segment will continue to focus on maintaining its customer base and the high quality of its products and on developing new products 
the segment has recently benefited from lower raw material costs 
the cost of cashews  a major ingredient  has trended down from significant highs in fiscal but now appears to have stabilized 
as discussed above  the farm bill has resulted in lower peanut costs and may have a favorable effect on future profitability  but this effect cannot be quantified at this time 
vitamin litigation on november   the company received million from one defendant in settlement of claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation 
litigation is ongoing regarding similar claims with additional defendants  but the outcomes cannot be determined at this time 
overall the company s management believes that the opportunities in the private label and value brand areas are favorable for long term growth 
management has taken significant steps to reshape the company  reducing its reliance on any one business segment while achieving sufficient scale in the categories in which it operates 
management expects to continue to improve its business mix through volume and profit growth of existing businesses  as well as through acquisitions or alliances 
management will continue to explore those acquisition opportunities that strategically fit with the company s intention to be the premier provider of private label  or value oriented  food products 
inflation management recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the company through higher asset replacement costs  related depreciation and higher material costs 
the company tries to minimize these effects through cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins 
it is management s view that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations in the three years ended september  critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion is presented pursuant to the united states securities and exchange commission s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the policies below are both important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 

table of contents under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  ralcorp makes estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the company bases estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings 
should a greater proportion of customers redeem incentives than estimated by the company  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete product and packaging materials 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
management reviews long lived assets  including leasehold improvements and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  ralcorp adopted fas  which requires that the company no longer amortize goodwill but review for impairment on a regular basis 
during fiscal  ralcorp completed its transitional impairment tests and its initial annual impairment tests  which resulted in no impairment 
the goodwill impairment tests require the company to estimate the fair value of its businesses  for which ralcorp utilizes discounted cash flow analyses based on projected cash flows 
pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
the company reviews annually the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions  based on current market conditions  as necessary 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense income ultimately recognized 
the other postretirement benefits liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in healthcare costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected healthcare costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense 
liabilities for workers compensation and accrued health care costs are estimated based on historical experience and expected trends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so 
as of september  and  a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of the company s principal commodities  including corn  oats  wheat and soybean oil  would have decreased the fair value of the company s derivatives portfolio by million and million  respectively 
this volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions 
because the company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit  all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures 
for more information  see note and note to the financial statements included in item the company has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt 
at september  and  the company had million and million of variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical adverse change in weighted average interest rates during fiscal and would have had an unfavorable impact of 
million and million  respectively  on both the company s net earnings and cash flows
