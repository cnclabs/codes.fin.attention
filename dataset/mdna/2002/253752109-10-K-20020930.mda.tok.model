item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements also included in this form k 
some of the information that follows are not statements of historical fact but merely reflect our intent  belief or expectations regarding the anticipated effect of events  circumstances and trends 
such statements should be considered as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations 
factors that might cause or contribute to differences between our expectations and actual results include uncertainty of market acceptance of our products by the worldwide medical community  uncertainty of future profitability and cash generation from operations  our limited sales and marketing experience  the extent of future expenditures for sales and marketing programs  delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development  uncertainty regarding patents and propriety rights in connection with our products and products in development  dependence on third party reimbursement from government entities  managed care organizations  and private insurance plans  risks inherent in international transactions  including those relating to our expansion in europe and elsewhere  our ability to scale up our manufacturing to the extent product sales increase  uncertainty of clinical trial results for our products in development  our ability to obtain requisite additional financing to fund our operations beyond calendar year  and other factors as set forth under the caption additional considerations beginning on page overview since our incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing  manufacturing and marketing our proprietary gene based testing systems using our patented hybrid capture technology for the screening  monitoring and diagnosis of human diseases 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial operating losses  resulting principally from expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory submissions for our products  the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and our global sales and marketing activities 
our revenues to a significant extent have been derived from the sales of our hpv test  which  for fiscal  accounted for of total revenues 
we expect that the growing acceptance of our hpv test in both the united states and internationally will continue to drive the growth in revenues from our hpv test in the future 
in fiscal  our gross margins improved substantially over the prior fiscal year 
in the coming fiscal year  we believe that we will be able to sustain gross margins consistent with  or better than  fiscal as we continue to scale up our manufacturing operations and realize expanded margins as a result of our direct distribution efforts in europe 
our margins may be negatively impacted by increased sales of lower margin chlamydia and gonorrhea tests 
we believe that increasing our investment in sales and marketing and in research and development is essential to allow us to capitalize more fully on the potential of our hpv test and our core technology 
we expect to invest heavily in our direct european distribution operation during fiscal and beyond while also expanding our direct sales organization in the united states 
we also expect to moderately increase our expenditures in the development of our next generation hybrid capture and platforms and clinical trial activities for human papillomavirus screening in the coming fiscal year as compared to fiscal our sales and marketing expenditures have been and will continue to be focused on accelerating the adoption of human papillomavirus testing worldwide 
we intend to capitalize on the growing acceptance of our hpv test in the united states and internationally by physicians  laboratories and health insurance providers by materially increasing expenditures on sales and marketing over the next several quarters 
the increase in expenditures will be primarily directed at expanded direct sales and marketing efforts in the united states and europe 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase to provide adequate infrastructure to support greater research and development and sales and marketing activities  to pay the anticipated expenses associated with our ongoing litigation matters and to support the overall growth of our business 
as a result of these anticipated increases in expenditures  we expect our operating losses to continue through fiscal with a turn to profitability near the end of fiscal there can be no assurance that we will meet this goal 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an growth in sales of our hpv tests and testing services over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal  partially offset by decreases in sales of equipment and non core products 
the majority of the growth in hpv products sales was in the united states over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal and in europe over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal 
during fiscal  we recognized revenue of approximately  related to minimum purchase guarantees under the roche distribution contract as compared to approximately  in fiscal under the roche distribution contract  roche has no further minimum purchase obligations after june   which may adversely affect our product revenues unless we are able to increase product sales 
please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
other revenues include research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the recognition of equipment sales in europe which were initially deferred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and additional research and development revenue under an existing contract  partially offset by a reduction in licensing revenue under an exclusive contract  which was converted to non exclusive during fiscal we expect other revenues to decrease in fiscal principally due to the expiration in july of a small business innovation research  or sbir  grant related to a herpes testing product 
cost of product sales marginally increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage primarily related to increased sales of our hpv test products  principally in the united states where we sell such products directly  and decreased sales of lower margin equipment products  as well as the elimination  by the first quarter of fiscal  of certain expenses associated with the relocation to our new manufacturing facility in april which negatively impacted our gross margins during fiscal  improved inventory management and the recognition of minimum purchase guarantees by roche  partially offset by european value added taxes on inventory purchases 
research and development expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenses was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased  professional services and clinical trial expenses  which increased and laboratory supplies  which increased 
our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including different or modified uses of such technology  and improvements to our diagnostic test and equipment products 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not account for research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
during fiscal  we focused our research and development activities principally on the development of our rapid capture system for automated processing of our hybrid capture tests  initially related to hpv and ct gc  activities related to the preparation of a pma supplement that we submitted to the us food and drug administration fda in october to obtain market approval for the dna pap which involves the use of our hybrid capture hpv test as a primary cervical cancer screening test to be performed in conjunction with the pap smear for women ages and older  the development of our universal collection medium ucm that is expected to allow the simultaneous testing for hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea and of other genetic and cellular material from a single patient sample  clinical trials related to ct gc testing for thinprep specimens and hpv testing from the tripath prep system  and the creation of our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
as indicated above  as part of our research and development activities  we submitted a pre market approval pma supplement application to the fda in october to obtain market approval for the use of our dna pap 
on march   we presented preliminary scientific data from our pma supplement for the dna pap to the fda s microbiology devices panel 
following the fda advisory panel meeting  the fda microbiology devices panel recommended the fda approve our pma supplement  provided that we make certain additional information available to the fda 
following the fda advisory panel meeting  the fda notified us that our pma supplement for the dna pap would not be approvable until we submit an amendment to the pma supplement providing the additional information recommended by the fda microbiology devices panel 
we intend to provide the requested information in the form of an amendment to our pma supplement in september and may provide additional information later in selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to various marketing programs and associated professional expenses  which increased  royalty costs  which increased  and personnel costs  which increased 
in fiscal  we retained the services of an advertising agency 
all of the costs associated with this agency were treated as advertising costs 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase during fiscal as we establish direct sales and marketing operations in europe due to the expiration  on april   of abbott s non exclusive distribution wind down period for our hpv and ct gc products in europe  africa and the middle east and the expiration of the roche distribution contract on june   and as we expand our direct sales organization in the united states to increase hpv product sales and commercialize our ct gc products 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to professional fees  which increased  and personnel costs  which increased 
the increase in professional fees was primarily attributable to legal and accounting fees associated with the proposed merger with cytyc corporation  as well as our litigation proceedings with ventana medical systems  inc and with enzo biochem  inc 
and its subsidiary  enzo diagnostics  inc in addition  in june  we determined the balance outstanding on the promissory note with kd medical  inc was uncollectible and took a charge against operations for the unpaid principal and accrued interest of approximately  in connection with an amendment to the abbott agreement  on january   digene issued  shares of common stock to abbott in a private placement transaction representing an agreed upon termination fee paid to abbott as consideration for the termination of abbott s exclusive rights to sell our chlamydia and gonorrhea products worldwide 
digene recognized a one time expense of  in the third quarter of fiscal representing the fair market value of the shares issued to abbott in this transaction 
interest income decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal the cash received from roche associated with advance minimum payments was held in an account that did not provide interest income to digene 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the growth in sales of our hpv products representing of the total increase and an increase of over sales of hpv products in fiscal and growth in sales of our equipment products representing of the total increase and an increase of over sales of equipment in fiscal 
the majority of the growth in hpv products sales was due to increased sales in the united states over sales in fiscal  along with increased sales in international markets over sales in fiscal 
during fiscal  we recognized revenue of approximately  related to minimum purchase guarantees under the roche distribution contract 
research and development contract revenues decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in revenue under an exclusive contract  which was converted to non exclusive during fiscal cost of product sales increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal gross margin on product sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  our gross margin was negatively impacted by the effects of the relocation to our new manufacturing facility in april  including the installation of equipment  validation of the facility  employee turnover and other activities  which resulted in reduced production yield  quality difficulties  excessive disposal and product backorders 
the issues associated with our relocation were satisfactorily resolved during fiscal our gross margin was also negatively impacted by product mix 
however  the negative impact on our gross margins was partially mitigated by improved sales during the second half of fiscal of hpv products in the united states  where we sell such products directly 
during fiscal  we focused our research and development activities principally on the development of our rapid capture system for automated processing of our hybrid capture tests  initially related to chlamydia and gonorrhea  activities related to the preparation of fda filings that we intend to submit to obtain market approval for the use of our hybrid capture hpv test as a primary cervical cancer screening test to be performed in conjunction with the pap smear for women ages and older  the development of our ucm  activities utilizing our hybrid capture technology for microarray based genomics analysis in the areas of gene expression profiling  genotyping and molecular disease management  and the creation of our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
research and development expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenses was due primarily to a increase in purchases of laboratory supplies  a increase in personnel costs  and a increase in facilities costs  partially offset by a decrease in outside professional services and clinical trial expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to a increase in personnel costs  a increase in facilities costs and a increase in royalty costs  partially offset by decreases in costs of marketing programs of 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to a increase in professional fees primarily as a result of expenses of approximately  related to a planned follow on public offering of our common stock  which was withdrawn in march additional increases included facilities costs consisting of a increase in rent and related expenses associated with our new facility  and a increase in personnel costs 
other expense was approximately  in fiscal as compared to other income of approximately  in fiscal the other income in fiscal resulted from a gain of approximately  from the sale  in march  of our molecular biology reagents product line to kd medical  inc interest income increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances  primarily as a result of the investment of the proceeds of our private placement completed in december impairment of intangible asset in fiscal in february  we entered into an agency agreement with murex diagnostics corporation murex to facilitate the creation of a digene direct european sales operation for our products in europe 
as part of the agency agreement  we purchased a customer list with the expectation that this list could be used to benefit our direct management of sales activities in europe and would result in increased revenues and gross margins 
we paid million for this customer list and capitalized it as an intangible asset 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  abbott laboratories abbott purchased murex  which significantly reduced our expectation that we could implement the agency agreement as contemplated and realize any benefit from our investment in the customer list 
consequently  we believe that the asset was impaired and would provide no future benefit 
accordingly  we wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the write off was originally recorded in fiscal as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the adoption of statement of position  reporting the costs of startup activities 
subsequently  we believe this adjustment should have been presented as an operating expense for the impairment of an intangible asset 
accordingly  the charge has been reclassified as an increase in selling and marketing costs in fiscal as a result of this reclassification  previously reported loss from operations before income taxes in fiscal increased to approximately  from approximately  net loss for fiscal was unchanged 
on may   we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with abbott with respect to the marketing and distribution  and related customer services  of our products in europe  africa and the middle east 
the terms of the marketing and distribution agreement effectively transferred direct management of sales activities in europe to abbott 
all rights and obligations of digene and murex under the agency agreement and the related customer list were terminated by such abbott agreement 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our expenses have significantly exceeded our revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million at june  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately million 
net cash used in our operating activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  capital expenditures increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to our repurchase from abbott laboratories of equipment used for hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and previously purchased by abbott under our marketing and distribution agreement with abbott the abbott agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the abbott agreement  upon expiration of the non exclusive wind down period we were obligated  at abbott s option  to repurchase equipment placed with customers by abbott 
we satisfied this obligation by issuing a promissory note to abbott on june  for  bearing interest at per annum and payable in quarterly installments of  until april  on april   we entered into a letter agreement with roche molecular systems the roche distribution contract  which established roche molecular systems roche as the co exclusive distributor of our hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east from may  through june  in june  we adopted as our sole strategy for the distribution of our products in europe  africa and the middle east  a combination of direct distribution through our european infrastructure and the use of local distributors and agents 
on june   the term of the roche distribution contract expired  subject to a non exclusive wind down period 
under the roche distribution contract  we have the option  exercisable within days after december   to buy back from roche equipment purchased from us by roche and in use for hpv testing in customers laboratories on june  if we repurchase the equipment  the non exclusive wind down period will expire on december  if we do not repurchase the equipment  the non exclusive wind down period will extend to december  in june  as part of our strategic decision  we decided that we would exercise the option to repurchase the equipment 
the roche distribution contract sets the repurchase price for the equipment as the net selling price less any amounts recorded as depreciation on a straight line basis over a four year period 
in recognition of the possible repurchase of the equipment  commencing in the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of revenue from equipment sold to roche 
equipment sold during this time period had a sales price of million and a cost of million  which amounts have been recorded as deferred revenue and deferred costs  respectively 
the deferred revenue and deferred costs are being amortized over a four year period to other revenue as equipment rental and selling and marketing expenses  respectively 
for the year ended june   we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively related to the amortization of these balances 
on january   we issued  shares of common stock to abbott laboratories in a private placement transaction as consideration for the termination of abbott s exclusive rights to sell our chlamydia and gonorrhea products worldwide 
we recognized a one time expense of  in the third quarter of fiscal representing the fair market value of the shares issued to abbott in this transaction 
on january   we completed a private offering of  shares of common stock  the net proceeds of which  after expenses  were approximately  we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including to support our sales and marketing and research and development activities 
we anticipate that working capital requirements will increase moderately for the foreseeable future due to investment necessary to support our european direct distribution operations  including the buy back from roche of equipment in europe  as well as increasing accounts receivable as a result of expected revenue growth 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts  expand our sales and marketing activities and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations through calendar year our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds may change  however  based on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of our products  progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  progress in our regulatory affairs activities  the cost and timing of expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  the development and maintenance of effective sales and marketing activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development and maturation of strategic alliances for the marketing of our products 
to the extent that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
we do not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
under such conditions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we have summarized below our material contractual obligations as of june  in thousands less than one one to three four to five after five year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal years after contractual obligations total fiscal long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows inventory management 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a weighted average approach  which approximates the first in first out method of inventory management 
we also record provisions for inventories which may not be salable due to anticipated trends in sales volume and or pricing and our estimates of net realizable value 
these provisions are determined based on significant estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns and discounts based on historical default rates and specifically identified problem accounts 
accounting for employee stock options 
we account for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  which allows us to recognize compensation costs for the excess of the estimated fair value of the stock option at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
which requires the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock options vesting period 
had we applied the principles of sfas no 
for our employee options  our net loss would have been approximately   and  during our fiscal years ended june   and instead of our reported net loss which approximated   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk comes from our operations in europe and south america 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for the years ended june   and interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments owned by us 
such securities are debt instruments that generate interest income for us on cash balances 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature  less than twelve months  of certain investments 
we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on our business
