item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at t corp 
at t or the company is among the world s communications leaders  providing voice  data and video communications services to large and small businesses  consumers and government agencies 
we provide domestic and international long distance  regional and local communications services  cable broadband television and internet communication services 
restructuring of at t on october   at t announced a restructuring plan designed to fully separate or issue separately tracked stocks intended to reflect the financial performance and economic value of each of at t s four major operating units 
on december   at t and comcast corporation comcast announced an agreement to combine at t broadband with comcast 
under the terms of the agreement  at t will spin off at t broadband and simultaneously merge it with comcast  forming a new company to be called at t comcast corporation at t comcast 
at t shareowners will receive a number of shares of at t comcast common stock based on an exchange ratio calculated pursuant to a formula specified in the merger agreement 
if determined as of the date of the merger agreement  the exchange ratio would have been approximately  assuming the at t shares held by comcast are included in the number of shares of at t common stock outstanding 
assuming comcast retains its at t shares and converts them into exchangeable preferred stock of at t as contemplated by the merger agreement  the exchange ratio would be approximately 
at t shareowners will own a economic stake and an approximate voting interest in the new company  calculated as of the date of the merger agreement 
the merger of at t broadband and comcast is subject to regulatory review  approval by both companies shareowners and certain other conditions  and is expected to close by the end of at t also intends to proceed with the creation of a tracking stock for its at t consumer services business  which is expected to be distributed to at t shareowners following shareowner approval in on february   the company filed a preliminary proxy with the sec  seeking shareowner approval of the at t broadband and comcast merger  and the creation of the at t consumer services tracking stock  among other things 
these restructuring activities are complicated and involve a substantial number of steps and transactions  including obtaining various approvals  such as internal revenue service irs rulings 
at t anticipates  however  that the transactions associated with at t s restructuring plan will be tax free to us shareowners 
future financial conditions  superior alternatives or other factors may arise or occur that make it inadvisable to proceed with part or all of at t s restructuring plans 
any or all of the elements of at t s restructuring plan may not occur as we currently expect or in the time frames that we currently contemplate  or at all 
alternative forms of restructuring  including sales of interests in these businesses  would reduce what is available for distribution to at t shareowners in the restructuring 
on may   at t completed an exchange offer of at t common stock for at t wireless stock 
under the terms of the exchange offer  at t issued shares of at t wireless group tracking stock in exchange for each share of at t common stock validly tendered 
a total of million shares of at t common stock were tendered in exchange for million shares of at t wireless group tracking stock 
in conjunction with the exchange offer  at t recorded an premium as a reduction to net income available to common shareowners 
the premium represents the excess of the fair value of the at t wireless group tracking stock issued over the fair value of the at t common stock exchanged 
on july   at t completed the split off of at t wireless as a separate  independently traded company 
all at t wireless group tracking stock was converted into at t wireless common stock on a one for one basis and  million shares of at t wireless common stock held by at t were distributed to at t common shareowners on a basis of of a share of at t wireless for each at t share outstanding 
at t common shareowners received whole shares of at t wireless and cash payments for fractional shares 
the irs ruled that the transaction qualified as tax free for at t and its shareowners for us federal income tax purposes  with the exception of cash received for fractional shares 
for accounting purposes  the deemed effective split off date was june  at the time of split off  at t retained approximately billion  or  of at t wireless common stock  about half of which was used in a debt for equity exchange in july in the remaining portion of these holdings was monetized in october and december through the issuance of debt that is exchangeable into wireless shares or their cash equivalents at maturity 
the split off of at t wireless resulted in a noncash tax free gain of billion  which represented the difference between the fair value of the at t wireless tracking stock at the date of the split off and at t s book value in at t wireless services 
this gain was recorded in the third quarter of as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income 
on august   at t completed the split off of liberty media corporation as an independent  publicly traded company since at t did not exit the line of business that liberty media group lmg operated in  lmg was not accounted for as a discontinued operation 
at t redeemed each outstanding share of class a and class b lmg tracking stock for one share of liberty media corporation s series a and series b common stock  respectively 
the irs ruled that the split off of liberty media corporation qualified as a tax free transaction for at t  liberty media and their shareowners 
for accounting purposes  the deemed effective split off date was july  tracking stocks during the periods through  at t had one or more tracking stocks outstanding 
in  in connection with the acquisition of tele communications  inc tci  at t issued a separate tracking stock to reflect of the performance of lmg 
in  at t issued a tracking stock to track the financial performance of at t wireless group 
the shares initially issued tracked approximately of the performance of at t wireless group 
a tracking stock is designed to provide financial returns to its holders based on the financial performance and economic value of the assets it tracks 
ownership of shares of at t common stock  at t wireless group tracking stock or liberty media class a or b tracking stock did not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of any of the groups  but an ownership of at t in total 
the specific shares represented an interest in the economic performance of the net assets of each of the groups 
the earnings attributable to at t wireless group are excluded from the earnings available to at t common stock group and are reflected as income loss from discontinued operations  net of applicable taxes of at t wireless group in the consolidated statements of income 
similarly  the earnings and losses related to lmg are excluded from the earnings available to at t common stock group 
the remaining results of operations of at t  including the financial performance of at t wireless group not represented by the tracking stock  are referred to as the at t common stock group and are represented by at t common stock 
we did not have a controlling financial interest in lmg for financial accounting purposes  therefore  our ownership in lmg was reflected as an investment accounted for under the equity method in at t s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts attributable to lmg are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as equity losses earnings from liberty media group and investment in liberty media group and related receivables  net prior to its split off from at t 
at t wireless group was an integrated business of at t  and lmg was a combination of certain assets and businesses of at t  neither was a stand alone entity prior to its split off from at t 
merger with mediaone group  inc 
we completed the merger with mediaone group  inc mediaone on june   in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately billion 
we issued approximately million shares of at t common stock  of which million were treasury shares  and made cash payments of approximately billion 
the merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting  whereby the assets and liabilities of mediaone group were recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition 
accordingly  the results of mediaone have been included with the financial results of at t  within at t broadband  since the date of acquisition 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  periods prior to the merger were not restated to include the results of mediaone

the words estimate  project  intend  expect  believe  plan and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this document 
moreover  in the future  at t  through its senior management  may make forward looking statements about the matters described in this document or other matters concerning at t 
the discussion and analysis that follows provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of at t s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  and financial condition as of december  and critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments at t s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  internal use software and intangible assets  investments  derivative contracts  pension and other postretirement benefits and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue recognition we only record revenue for transactions which are considered to be part of our central  ongoing operations 
we recognize long distance and local voice and data services revenue based upon minutes of traffic processed or contracted fee schedules including sales of prepaid calling cards 
cable video and nonvideo installation revenue is recognized in the period the installation services are provided to the extent of direct selling costs 
any remaining amount is deferred and recognized over the estimated average period that customers are expected to remain connected to the cable distribution systems 
customer activation fees  along with the related costs up to but not exceeding the revenues  are deferred and amortized over the customer relationship period 
we recognize other products and services revenue when the products are delivered and accepted by customers and when services are provided in accordance with contract terms 
for contracts where we provide customers with an indefeasible right to use network capacity  we recognize revenue ratably over the stated life of the agreement 
any sales of installed fiber are not recognized as revenue 
we consider these transactions to be sales of property  plant and equipment and record any gain or loss in other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our allowances on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivable based on past experience and taking into account current collection trends that are expected to continue 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  we would increase our allowances for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
accounts receivable are fully reserved for when past due days or more 
estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment  internal use software and intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of property  plant and equipment  internal use software and intangible assets in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the useful lives are estimated at the time the asset is acquired and are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
alternatively  these types of technological changes could result in the recognition of an impairment charge to reflect the write down in value of the asset 
we review these types of assets for impairment annually  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we use cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
beginning january   in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will no longer amortize goodwill  excess basis related to equity method investments and franchise costs  but will test these assets at least annually for impairment 
investments we hold investments in other companies which we account for under either the cost method or equity method of accounting 
many of these companies are publicly traded and have volatile share prices however  some of these companies are not publicly traded and therefore the value may be difficult to determine 
for investments that are not publicly traded we estimate fair value using market based comparable sales and income based discounted cash flow methods 
in addition  we have monetized some of these investments by issuing debt that is tied to the trading price of the security  and which can be settled in shares or cash 
some of our cost method investments are classified as trading securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and are marked to market through the income statement 
however  other cost method investments are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
and are marked to market through other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
we record an investment impairment charge on our available for sale and equity method investments when we believe the decline in the investment value is other than temporary 
when determining an other than temporary decline  we consider  among other items  the length of time the trading price has been below our carrying value  the financial condition of the investee company  including the industry in which they operate  and our ability or intent to retain the investment 
if the financial condition of the investee company or the industry in which it operates were to be materially different than our expectation  we would record an expense to reflect the other than temporary decline in value of the investment 
at december   unrealized losses on available for sale securities included in other comprehensive income as a component of shareowners equity were approximately billion pretax 
derivative contracts we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
certain exchangeable debt debt exchangeable into or tied to the value of securities we own contain embedded derivatives that require accounting separate from the debt instrument  while other exchangeable debt has derivatives issued in conjunction with net purchased options 
the fair value of option based derivatives is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which is based on a set of inputs  including the price of the underlying stock  volatility of the underlying stock and interest rates 
these inputs are based on prevailing market indications that are either directly observable in the market  received from qualified investment banking firms or are internally calculated 
changes in these inputs would result in a change in the fair value of the option contracts 
changes in the fair value of option contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges would be recorded  net of income taxes  within other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of option contracts undesignated for accounting purposes would be recorded within other income expense on the income statement 
generally  fair value calculations of other derivative contracts eg  interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards require less judgment and are valued based on market interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
pension and postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
a significant assumption used in determining our net pension credit income and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
on average  our actual return on plan assets over the long term has substantially exceeded  however  in the past two years  the plan s assets have experienced rates of return substantially lower than 
for  we will lower our expected long term rate of return assumption from to  reflecting the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
we expect this decrease in the expected long term rate of return to decrease operating income by approximately billion 
another estimate that affects our net pension credit and postretirement expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
at the end of each year  we determine the appropriate discount rate  which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at december   we lowered our discount rate to from at december  changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on our results of operations 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if enacted tax rates changed  we would adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities  through the provision for income taxes in the period of change  to reflect the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse 
a one percentage point change in the enacted tax rates would increase or decrease net income by approximately billion 
we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  we take into account the level of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if future taxable income was lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies were not available as anticipated  we may record additional valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had long term deferred tax assets included within long term deferred tax liabilities of billion  which included a valuation allowance of million 
consolidated results of operations the comparison of results with results was affected by events such as acquisitions and dispositions that occurred in these two years 
for example  included in was a full year of mediaone results  however  included mediaone s results only since the june   date of acquisition 
in addition  we had dispositions of certain cable systems during each year and disposed of international businesses during cable systems and businesses disposed of in were included in results for part of the year and not in results 
likewise  cable systems disposed of in were included in results for the full year and in results for part of the year 
also  at home corp 
excite home affected the comparison of annual results 
for the period january   through august   excite home was accounted for as an equity method investment 
for the period september   through december   excite home was fully consolidated as a result of corporate governance changes  which gave at t the right to designate six of the excite home board members  and therefore  a controlling interest 
in  excite home was fully consolidated for the period january   through september   the date excite home filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
as a result of the bankruptcy and at t removing four of its six members from the excite home board of directors  at t no longer consolidated excite home as of september  the consolidation of excite home effective september  resulted in the inclusion of of its results in each line item of at t s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
the approximate of excite home not owned by at t is shown in the consolidated balance sheet within minority interest and as a component of minority interest income expense in the and consolidated statements of income 
as a result of the significant losses incurred by excite home  the minority interest balance was fully utilized in september  therefore  in september at t recognized more than its share of losses of excite home 
under the equity method of accounting  any earnings or losses are included as a component of net losses related to other equity investments in the consolidated statement of income 
beginning october   at t no longer records equity earnings or losses related to excite home since at t recognized losses in excess of its investment in excite home 
effective july   the fcc eliminated primary interexchange carrier charges picc or per line charges that at t pays for residential and single line business customers 
the elimination of these per line charges resulted in lower access expense as well as lower revenue  since at t has historically billed its customers for these charges 
the comparison of results with results was also affected by the acquisition of mediaone and the elimination picc 
in addition  we acquired tci and the ibm global network now at t global network services or agns during therefore  twelve months of their results are included in s results  but are included for only a part of since their respective dates of acquisition 
dispositions of certain cable systems and international businesses occurred during and  affecting comparability 
the consolidation of excite home  effective september   also affected comparability 
prior to september   excite home was accounted for as an equity method investment 
finally  the comparison of results with results was impacted by the launch of concert on january   our global joint venture with british telecommunications plc bt 
at t contributed all of its international gateway to gateway assets and the economic value of approximately multinational customers specifically targeted for direct sales by concert 
as a result  results do not include the revenue and expenses associated with these customers and businesses  while does  and results include our proportionate share of concert s earnings in net losses related to other equity investments in the consolidated statements of income 
on october   at t and bt announced that they had reached binding agreements to unwind concert 
under the concert dissolution agreement with bt  at t will reclaim customer contracts and assets that were initially contributed to the venture  including international transport facilities and gateway assets 
in addition  at t business services will obtain ownership of certain frame relay assets located in the asia pacific region that bt initially contributed to the venture 
at t business services expects to combine these assets with its existing international networking and other assets 
the unwind of concert is expected to close by the end of the first half of revenue for the years ended december  dollars in millions at t business services    at t consumer services    at t broadband    corporate and other total revenue    total revenue decreased  or billion  in compared with the decline was largely driven by accelerating declines in long distance voice revenue of approximately billion 
partially offsetting the decline was revenue of approximately billion  primarily attributable to growth in data and internet protocol ip  local and outsourcing services within at t business services  and increased revenue from at t broadband  primarily telephony  high speed data  expanded basic cable and digital video 
also offsetting the decline was revenue of approximately billion largely due to net acquisitions primarily mediaone  and the consolidation of excite home  partially offset by the elimination of picc 
we expect long distance revenue to continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing competition and product substitution and while we expect data and ip revenue to continue to grow  we expect the growth rate to slow 
revenue in will be positively impacted by the inclusion of revenue resulting from the unwind of concert  including revenue from multinational customers and foreign billed revenue previously contributed to concert 
in addition  we expect revenue from at t broadband to increase 
total revenue increased  or billion  in compared with primarily driven by a growing demand for our ip  outsourcing within at t business services and growth in at t broadband of approximately billion  as well as the impact of acquisitions and the consolidation of excite home  partially offset by the impact of concert  dispositions and the elimination of picc of approximately billion 
these revenue increases were partially offset by continued declines in long distance voice revenue of approximately billion 
revenue by segment is discussed in greater detail in the segment results section 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions access and other connection    access and other connection expenses decreased  or billion  in compared with included within access and other connection expenses are costs that we pay to connect calls on the facilities of other service providers  as well as the universal service fund contributions and per line charges mandated by the fcc 
approximately billion of the decrease was due to mandated reductions in per minute access rates  lower per line charges and lower international connection rates 
in july  per line charges that at t paid for residential and single line business customers were eliminated by the fcc 
these reductions were partially offset by a billion increase due to overall volume growth primarily related to local and international services and higher universal service fund contributions 
since most of these charges are passed through to the customer  the per minute access rate and per line charge reductions and the increased universal service fund contributions have generally resulted in a corresponding impact on revenue 
in  access and other connection expenses will continue to decline as a result of mandated reductions in per minute access rates  lower universal service fund contributions and lower long distance call volumes 
these reductions will be partially offset by an increase in local connectivity expenses primarily due to growth in local services 
in addition  the unwind of concert will also result in lower access and other connections expenses  since in the charge from concert was recorded as access and other connection expenses and in as we take back assets  we will record the expenses in each line item based on how the assets and customers are served and managed 
access and other connection expenses decreased to billion in  compared with billion in mandated reductions in per minute access costs and decreased per line charges resulted in lower costs of approximately billion 
also contributing to the decrease was more efficient network usage 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately billion of higher costs due to volume increases  and billion as a result of higher universal service fund contributions 
costs paid to telephone companies outside of the united states to connect calls made to countries outside of the united states international settlements are also included within access and other connection expenses 
international interconnection charges decreased approximately billion in  as a result of the commencement of operations of concert 
concert incurred most of our international settlements and earned most of our foreign billed revenue  previously incurred and earned directly by at t 
in  concert billed us a net expense composed of international settlement interconnection expense and foreign billed revenue 
the amount charged by concert in was lower than interconnection expense incurred in  since at t recorded these transactions as revenue and expense  as applicable 
partially offsetting the decline were costs incurred related to concert products that at t now sells to its customers 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions costs of services and products    costs of services and products include the costs of operating and maintaining our networks  costs to support our outsourcing contracts including cost of equipment sold  programming for cable services  the provision for uncollectible receivables and other service related costs 
these costs increased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the increase was driven by net acquisitions  primarily mediaone  and the consolidation of excite home 
also contributing to the increase was approximately billion of higher costs associated with our growth businesses  primarily at at t business services  including the cost of equipment sold within our outsourcing solutions business  and higher cable television programming costs 
in addition  costs increased approximately billion due to estimated losses on certain long term contracts at at t business services and a lower pension credit income and higher postretirement expense in resulting from a decreased return on plan assets 
these increases were partially offset by approximately billion of lower costs associated with lower revenue  primarily lower volumes at at t business services  including our international operations and lower payphone compensation costs 
in  costs of services and products are expected to increase slightly as a result of the unwind of concert  significantly offset by the deconsolidation of excite home 
costs of services and products increased billion  or  in compared with nearly billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the impact of consolidating excite home  net of the impact of concert and divestments of international businesses 
the expense also increased due to higher costs associated with new outsourcing contracts of approximately billion and approximately billion of higher cable television programming costs principally due to rate increases and higher costs associated with new broadband services 
these increases were partially offset by approximately billion of costs savings from continued cost control initiatives and a higher pension credit in  primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base  resulting from increased investment returns 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions selling  general and administrative    selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the increase was due to expenses associated with acquisitions  primarily mediaone  net of the impact of dispositions 
increased expenses in support of growth businesses  primarily data and ip  broadband  and local voice services  drove approximately billion of the increase 
these expenses included customer care  facilities and other related expenses  advertising  research and development and other general and administrative expenses 
also included in the increased sg a expenses were transaction costs of approximately billion associated with at t s restructuring announced in october a lower pension credit income and higher postretirement expense resulting from decreased return on plan assets  combined with higher compensation accruals contributed approximately billion to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with the impact of cost control efforts and decreased customer care and billing expenses of approximately billion primarily from at t consumer services 
as a result of the unwind of concert as well as lower pension credit income  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the decrease was due to savings from continued cost control initiatives and a higher pension credit in  primarily driven by a higher pension trust asset base  resulting from increased historical investment returns 
partially offsetting this decrease was approximately billion of higher expenses associated with our growing broadband business  and nearly billion of expenses associated with acquisitions and the consolidation of excite home  net of the impact of concert and dispositions 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions depreciation and other amortization    depreciation and other amortization expenses increased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the increase was attributable to the acquisition of mediaone and the consolidation of excite home  partially offset by net dispositions  primarily cable systems 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investments 
depreciation and other amortization expenses are expected to increase in reflecting the infrastructure investments made in as well as the impact of the unwind of concert 
in  depreciation and other amortization expenses rose billion  or  compared with approximately billion of the increase was due to acquisitions and the consolidation of excite home  net of dispositions and the impact of concert 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a higher asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment 
total capital expenditures for  and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we continue to focus the vast majority of our capital spending on our growth businesses of broadband  data and ip  and local 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions amortization of goodwill  franchise costs and other purchased intangibles    amortization of goodwill  franchise costs and other purchased intangibles decreased billion  or  in compared with the decrease was primarily due to a lower goodwill balance relating to excite home as a result of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  partially offset by the acquisition of mediaone 
franchise costs represent the value attributable to agreements with local authorities that allow access to homes in at t broadband s service areas 
other purchased intangibles arising from business combinations primarily included customer relationships 
in  we will no longer amortize goodwill or franchise costs in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accordingly  amortization of goodwill  franchise costs and other purchased intangibles will be significantly lower in a further discussion of the impacts of sfas no 
is included in new accounting pronouncements in this document 
in  amortization of goodwill  franchise costs and other purchased intangibles increased billion  or  compared with the prior year 
this increase was largely attributable to the consolidation of excite home  as well as acquisitions  primarily mediaone and tci 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions net restructuring and other charges   during  we recorded  million of net restructuring and other charges including approximately  million of restructuring and exit costs associated with at t s continued cost reduction initiatives and  million of asset impairment charges which were primarily related to excite home 
the  million of charges for restructuring and exit plans were comprised of  million for employee separations and benefit plan curtailment costs  million for facility closings and million related to termination of contractual obligations 
the restructuring and exit plans support our cost reduction efforts through headcount reductions across all segments of the business  primarily network support and customer care functions in at t business services  continued cost reduction efforts by excite home which was still consolidated into at t s results until september  in addition to impacts of the mediaone merger 
these charges were slightly offset by the reversal in december of million related to the business restructuring plans for fourth quarter and first quarter included in the  million of employee separations were million of benefit plan curtailment costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit plans 
approximately thousand employees will be separated in conjunction with these exit plans  approximately one half of which are management and one half are nonmanagement employees 
nearly thousand employee separations related to involuntary terminations and more than one thousand related to voluntary terminations 
approximately of the employees affected by the restructuring charges left their positions as of december   and the remaining will leave the company throughout termination benefits of approximately million were paid throughout the  million of asset impairments consisted of  million associated with the write down of goodwill and other intangibles  warrants granted in connection with distributing the home service and fixed assets 
these charges were due to continued deterioration in the business climate of  and reduced levels of venture capital funding activity for  internet advertising and other internet related companies  continued significant declines in the market values of excite home s competitors in the internet advertising industry  and changes in its operating and cash flow forecasts for the remainder of these charges were also impacted by excite home s decision to sell or shut down narrowband operations 
as a result of the foregoing  and other factors  excite home entered into bankruptcy proceedings in september in addition  at t recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of million associated with its acquisition goodwill of excite home 
since we consolidated  but only owned approximately of excite home  a portion of the charges recorded by excite home was not included as a reduction to at t s net income  but rather was eliminated in our consolidated statement of income as a component of minority interest income expense 
additionally  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to the write down of unrecoverable support assets where the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows 
the restructuring and exit plans did not yield cash savings net of severance benefit payouts in in subsequent years  the net cash savings will increase  due to the timing of actual separations and associated payments  until the completion of the exit plan at which time we expect to yield approximately billion of cash savings per year 
accordingly  there was no benefit to operating income net of the restructuring charges recorded in in subsequent years  the operating income benefit will continue to increase  due to timing of actual separations  until the completion of the exit plan  at which time we expect a benefit to operating income of approximately billion per year 
as a result of continuing realignment within at t broadband  we expect to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of in the range of million to million 
during  we recorded  million of net restructuring and other charges including  million of asset impairment charges related to excite home  million for restructuring and exit costs associated with at t s initiative to reduce costs  and million related to the government mandated disposition of at t communications uk ltd  which would have competed directly with concert 
the asset impairment charges related to excite home resulted from the deterioration of the market conditions and market valuations of internet related companies during the fourth quarter of  which caused excite home to conclude that intangible assets related to their acquisitions of internet related companies may not be recoverable 
accordingly  excite home conducted a detailed assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of acquired intangible assets 
this assessment resulted in a determination that certain acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  related to these acquisitions  including excite  were impaired as of december  as a result  excite home recorded impairment charges of  million in december  representing the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over their fair value 
the impairment was allocated to each asset group based on a comparison of carrying values and fair values 
the impairment write down within each asset group was allocated first to goodwill  and if goodwill was reduced to zero  to identifiable intangible assets in proportion to carrying values 
since we consolidated but only owned approximately of excite home  of the charge recorded by excite home was not included as a reduction to at t s net income  but rather was eliminated in our consolidated statement of income as minority interest income expense 
also as a result of the foregoing  at t recorded a goodwill and acquisition related impairment charge of  million associated with the acquisition of our investment in excite home 
the write down of our investment to fair value was determined utilizing discounted expected future cash flows 
the million charge for restructuring and exit plans was primarily due to headcount reductions  mainly in at t business services  including network operations  primarily for the consolidation of customer care and call centers  as well as synergies created by the mediaone merger 
included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefits associated with the separation of approximately  employees as part of voluntary and involuntary termination plans 
approximately one half of the separations were management employees and one half were non management employees 
approximately  employee separations were related to involuntary terminations and approximately to voluntary terminations 
we also recorded million of network lease and other contract termination costs associated with penalties incurred as part of notifying vendors of the termination of these contracts during the year  and net losses of million related to the disposition of facilities primarily due to synergies created by the mediaone merger 
also included in restructuring and exit costs in was million of benefit plan curtailment costs associated with employee separations as part of these exit plans 
further  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the write down of unrecoverable assets in certain businesses where the carrying value was no longer supported by estimated future cash flows 
during  we recorded million of net restructuring and other charges 
a million in process research and development charge was recorded reflecting the estimated fair value of research and development projects at tci  as of the date of the acquisition  which had not yet reached technological feasibility or had no alternative future use 
the projects identified related to efforts to offer voice over ip  product integration efforts for advanced set top devices  cost savings efforts for broadband telephony implementation  and in process research and development related to excite home 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development for each project using an income approach  which was adjusted to allocate fair value based on the project s percentage of completion 
under this approach  the present value of the anticipated future benefits of the projects was determined using a discount rate of 
for each project  the resulting net present value was multiplied by a percentage of completion based on effort expended to date versus projected costs to complete 
also in  a million charge for restructuring and exit costs was recorded as part of at t s initiative to reduce costs 
the restructuring and exit plans primarily focused on the maximization of synergies through headcount reductions in at t business services  including network operations  primarily for the consolidation of customer care and call centers 
included in exit costs was million of cash termination benefits associated with the separation of approximately  employees as part of voluntary and involuntary termination plans 
approximately one half of the separations were management employees and one half were non management employees 
approximately  employee separations were related to involuntary terminations and approximately  to voluntary terminations 
we also recorded net losses of million related to the government mandated disposition of certain international businesses that would have competed directly with concert  and million related to a contribution agreement at t broadband entered into with phoenixstar  inc that agreement requires at t broadband to satisfy certain liabilities owed by phoenixstar and its subsidiaries 
the remaining obligation under this contribution agreement and an agreement that mediaone had is million  which was fully accrued for at december  in addition  we recorded benefits of million related to the settlement of pension obligations for former employees who accepted at t s voluntary retirement incentive program vrip offer

the decline was primarily attributable to accelerating declines in the long distance business 
in addition  the acquisition of mediaone and net dispositions negatively impacted operating income by billion 
significantly offsetting these decreases was the net impact of excite home including the effect of lower asset impairments 
operating income decreased billion  or  in compared with the decrease was primarily due to higher net restructuring and other charges of billion 
also contributing to the decrease was the impact of the acquisition of mediaone and the consolidation of excite home  which lowered operating income by billion 
a majority of the impact of operating losses and the restructuring charge generated by excite home was offset in minority interest income expense in the consolidated statement of income  reflecting the approximate of excite home we do not own 
partially offsetting these decreases were cost control initiatives and a larger pension credit associated with our mature long distance businesses and related support groups  partially offset by lower long distance revenue 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions other expense income   other expense income in was an expense of billion compared with income of billion in the unfavorable variance of billion was driven primarily by higher investment impairment charges of billion  mostly consisting of impairments of vodafone plc and time warner telecom 
also contributing to the higher expense was an expense of billion reflecting mark to market charges in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and billion of lower net gains on the sales of businesses and investments 
other expense income improved billion  or  in compared with this improvement was primarily due to greater net gains on sales of businesses and investments of approximately billion  and higher investment related income of approximately billion 
the higher gains on sales were driven by significant gains associated with the swap of cable properties with comcast and cox  the sale of our investment in lenfest and related transactions  which gains aggregated approximately billion 
in  we recorded significant gains associated with the sale of our language line services business and a portion of our ownership interest in at t canada  which aggregated approximately billion 
offsetting the improvements to other expense income in was an approximate billion charge reflecting the increase in the fair value of put options held by comcast and cox related to excite home stock  and approximately billion of higher investment impairment charges 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions interest expense    in  interest expense increased billion  or 
the increase was due primarily to a higher average debt balance in  compared with the higher average debt balance was primarily a result of our june acquisition of mediaone  including outstanding debt of mediaone and debt issued to fund the mediaone acquisition 
the impact of mediaone was partially offset by the company s debt reduction efforts in interest expense increased  or billion  in compared with the increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance as a result of our june acquisition of mediaone  including outstanding debt of mediaone and debt issued to fund the mediaone acquisition  and our march acquisition of tci

the effective income tax rate was in  in and in in  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a significant net tax benefit related to excite home  including a benefit from the deconsolidation and the put obligation settlement with cox and comcast  partially offset by the prior consolidation of its operating losses which included asset impairment charges for which the company was unable to record tax benefits 
also positively impacting the effective tax rate was the net impact of a tax free exchange with comcast of at t stock held by comcast for an entity owning certain cable systems and the resulting reduction of a previously established deferred tax liability 
in addition  a benefit was recognized associated with the tax free gain from the disposal of a portion of at t s retained interest in at t wireless in a debt for equity exchange 
in  the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by excite home  for which the company was unable to record tax benefits associated with its pretax losses 
therefore  the billion restructuring charges taken by excite home in had no associated tax benefit 
the company also recorded a related nondeductible asset impairment charge of billion associated with its acquisition of excite home and a nondeductible charge to reflect the increase in the fair value of the put options related to excite home held by comcast and cox  both of which negatively impacted the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax free gain resulting from an exchange of at t stock for an entity owning certain cable systems and other assets with cox and the benefit of the write off of the related deferred tax liability 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a non tax deductible research and development charge  but positively impacted by a change in the net operating loss utilization tax rules that resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance and the income tax provision

equity losses for reflect results through july   the deemed effective date of the split off 
equity losses earnings from lmg were earnings of billion in  compared with losses of billion in the improvement was primarily due to gains on dispositions  including gains associated with the mergers of various companies that lmg had investments in 
gains were recorded for the difference between the carrying value of lmg s interest in the acquired company and the fair value of securities received in the merger 
in addition  lower stock compensation expense in compared with contributed to the improvement 
these were partially offset by impairment charges recorded on lmg s investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value and higher losses relating to lmg s equity affiliates 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions net losses related to other equity investments  net losses related to other equity investments were billion in compared with billion in  an increase of approximately billion

the pretax impairment charges were billion and consisted primarily of billion in charges related to the estimated loss on at t s commitment to purchase the shares of at t canada we do not own  a billion impairment charge related to the unwind of concert and an impairment of our investment in netphone of billion 
in addition  we recorded higher equity losses of billion from concert and netphone 
these losses were partially offset by billion in losses recorded for excite home in the first eight months of when we recorded the investment as an equity method investment 
excite home was fully consolidated beginning in september in  net losses related to other equity investments were billion  a improvement compared with this improvement was primarily a result of higher earnings from our investment in cablevision systems corp 
cablevision of approximately billion due to gains from cable system sales 
partially offsetting this improvement were losses from our stake in twe  which we acquired in connection with the mediaone merger  and greater equity losses from excite home  which aggregated approximately billion 
the income tax benefit recorded on net losses related to other equity investments was billion in both and  and a benefit of billion in the amortization of excess basis associated with nonconsolidated investments  recorded as a reduction of income  totaled billion in  and billion in both and effective january   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

segment results in support of the services we provided in  we segment our results by the operating units that support our primary lines of business at t business services  at t consumer services and at t broadband 
the balance of at t s operations  excluding lmg  is included in a corporate and other category 
although not a segment  we also discuss the results of lmg prior to its split off as an independent company 
ebit and ebitda are the primary measures used by at t s chief operating decision makers to measure at t s operating results and to measure segment profitability and performance 
at t calculates ebit as operating income loss plus other income expense  pretax minority interest income expense and net pretax losses related to other equity investments 
ebitda is defined as ebit  excluding minority interest income expense other than excite home s minority interest income expense  plus depreciation and amortization 
interest and income taxes are not factored into the segment profitability measure used by the chief operating decision makers  therefore  trends for these items are discussed on a consolidated basis 
management believes ebit and ebitda are meaningful to investors because they provide analyses of operating results using the same measures used by at t s chief operating decision makers 
in addition  we believe that both ebit and ebitda allow investors a means to evaluate the financial results of each segment in relation to total at t 
ebit for at t was a deficit of billion and earnings of billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
ebitda for at t was billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our calculations of ebit and ebitda may or may not be consistent with the calculation of these measures by other public companies 
ebit and ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ebitda does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes which can affect cash flow 
the discussion of segment results includes revenue  ebit  ebitda  capital additions and total assets 
the discussion of ebitda for at t broadband is modified to exclude other income expense and net pretax losses related to equity investments 
total assets for each segment generally include all assets  except intercompany receivables 
prepaid pension assets and corporate owned or leased real estate are generally held at the corporate level  and therefore are included in the corporate and other group 
in addition  all impacts of the adoption of sfas no 
 as well as the ongoing investment and derivative revaluation  are reflected in the corporate and other group 
the net assets of discontinued operations and the related income loss and gain on disposition are not reflected in the corporate and other group 
capital additions for each segment include capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  acquisitions of licenses  additions to nonconsolidated investments  increases in franchise costs and additions to internal use software 
in connection with our corporate restructuring program set forth in late  our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes that were implemented during the changes are as follows at t business services was expanded to include the results of international operations and ventures 
in addition  certain corporate costs that were previously recorded within the corporate and other group have been allocated to the respective segments in an effort to ultimately have the results of these businesses reflect all direct corporate costs as well as overhead for shared services 
all prior period results have been restated to reflect these changes 
reflecting the dynamics of our business  we continuously review our management model and structure  which may result in additional adjustments to our operating segments in the future 
at t business services at t business services offers a variety of global communications services to small and medium sized businesses  large domestic and multinational businesses and government agencies 
at t business services include long distance  international  toll free and local voice  data and ip networking  managed networking services and outsourcing solutions  and wholesale transport services sales of services to service resellers

a decline in long distance voice revenue of approximately billion drove the revenue decline 
significantly offsetting the decline was approximately billion of growth in data and ip services  local voice services and outsourcing solutions  including equipment sales 
in  at t business services revenue grew billion  or  compared with strength in data and ip services as well as growth in outsourcing solutions contributed billion to the increase 
this growth was largely offset by an approximate billion decline in long distance voice services as a result of continued pricing pressures in the industry and approximately billion due to the net impacts of concert  international dispositions and acquisitions 
in  long distance voice revenue declined at a low teen percentage rate reflecting the continuing impact of pricing pressures  mitigated somewhat by volume growth 
while volumes grew at a low single digit percentage rate  the rate of growth declined from a high single digit percentage growth rate in  reflecting the economic weakness impacting many key industry sectors  including travel  financial services  technology and retail  as well as the impact of wireless and e mail substitution 
these factors  along with pricing pressures  are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue in in  long distance voice services revenue declined at a mid single digit percentage rate after excluding the impact of concert 
the decline was primarily due to a declining average price per minute reflecting the competitive forces within the industry 
partially offsetting this decline was the high single digit percentage growth rate in volumes 
data and ip services including related product sales grew at a low double digit percentage rate in compared with the growth was led by packet services  which include frame relay  ip and asynchronous transfer mode atm 
packet services grew at a rate in the mid percent range 
total ip services a component of packet services  which include ip connectivity services  virtual private network vpn services and hosting services  also grew in the mid percent rate range 
the rate of growth of data services revenue declined in due primarily to a slow down in the rate of growth of high speed private line services and frame relay services as well as a decline in international private line services 
in  we expect data and ip revenue to grow  however  we expect the growth rate to decline from the growth rate 
the data and ip services growth rate including related product sales  as compared with  was impacted by acquisitions and the formation of concert 
excluding these impacts  data services grew at a high teens percentage rate 
growth was led by the continued strength of frame relay services  ip services  which include ip connectivity services and vpn services  and high speed private line services 
local voice services revenue grew more than in compared with  and grew nearly in compared with in  at t added more than thousand access lines and added more than thousand lines in access lines at the end of and were more than million and nearly million  respectively 
access lines enable at t to provide local service to customers by allowing direct connection from customer equipment to the at t network 
at the end of  at t served more than  buildings on network buildings where at t owns the connection that runs into the building  representing an increase of approximately over at the end of  at t served more than  buildings on network  compared with slightly more than  buildings at the end of in  we expect local voice services revenue to grow  however  we expect the growth rate to decline from the growth rate 
at t business services internal revenue was essentially flat in compared with  and increased million  or  in compared with the impact of internal revenue is included in the revenue by product discussions  above 
in  at t business services had lower internal revenue due to the split off of at t wireless on july   as these sales are now reported as external revenue 
this decrease was almost entirely offset by greater sales of services to other at t units  primarily at t broadband 
the increase in was the result of greater sales of business long distance services to other at t units that resell such services to their external customers  primarily at t broadband and at t wireless 
ebit ebitda in  ebit decreased billion  or  compared with ebitda declined billion  or  in compared with the declines in ebit and ebitda were primarily due to charges of billion in  related to the estimated loss on at t s commitment to purchase the remaining public shares of at t canada  and charges of billion in related to the unwind of concert 
also reflected in the declines was the impact of pricing pressure within the long distance voice business  as well as a shift from higher margin long distance services to lower margin growth services 
in  ebit and ebitda are expected to improve  primarily due to the charges we recorded related to at t canada and the unwind of concert  partially offset by lower net gains recorded in other expense income and lower operating income  reflecting continued softness in the long distance market 
ebit improved billion  or  and ebitda improved billion  or  in compared with the improvements reflect an increase in revenue and lower costs as a result of our continued cost control efforts  partially offset by the formation of concert and the acquisition of agns 
other items capital additions decreased billion in  and decreased billion in in  the decrease was a result of lower capital expenditures for the at t world wide intelligent network  as well as a reduced investment in concert 
in the decrease was a result of lower spending for our network and lower infusions into nonconsolidated international investments 
total assets decreased billion  or  at december   compared with december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in our investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries  primarily due to the write down of our investment in concert and equity losses from concert  and reduced receivables resulting from lower revenue and increased collection efforts 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in property  plant and equipment 
at t consumer services at t consumer services provides a variety of communications services to residential customers including domestic and international long distance  transaction based long distance  such as operator assisted service and prepaid phone cards  local and local toll intrastate calls outside the immediate local area  and dial up internet 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions revenue    ebit    ebitda    capital additions at december  total assets   revenue at t consumer services revenue declined billion  or  in compared with the decline was primarily due to a billion decline in traditional voice services  such as domestic and international dial services long distance calls where the number is dialed before the call  and domestic calling card services 
the traditional voice services were negatively impacted by an acceleration of wireless and e mail product substitution  and the impact of ongoing competition  which has led to a loss of market share 
in addition  the continued migration of customers to lower priced products and optional calling plans has also negatively impacted revenue 
as a result of the acceleration of substitution and competition  calling volumes declined at a low double digit percentage rate in the revenue decline also reflects a billion impact due to the elimination of per line charges in july partially offsetting these revenue declines was revenue growth of billion for prepaid card and local services 
we expect product substitution  competition including the continued entry of the regional bell operating companies into the long distance market and customer migration to lower priced calling plans and products to continue to negatively impact at t consumer services revenue in in  at t consumer services revenue decreased  or billion  compared with approximately billion of the decline was due to the elimination of per line charges in and the impact of concert 
the remainder of the decline was primarily due to a decline in traditional voice services  reflecting the ongoing competitive nature of the consumer long distance industry  which has resulted in pricing pressures and a loss of market share 
also negatively impacting revenue was product substitution and market migration away from direct dial wireline and higher priced calling card services to the rapidly growing wireless services and lower priced prepaid card services 
as a result  calling volumes declined at a mid single digit percentage rate in ebit ebitda ebit declined billion  or  and ebitda declined billion  or  in compared with in  ebit and ebitda margins declined to and  from and in  respectively 
as customers substitute long distance calling with wireless and e mail services and migrate to lower priced calling plans and lower margin products  they tend to remain at t consumer services customers 
these customers generate less revenue  however  the billing  customer care and fixed costs remain  resulting in lower ebit margins 
the margin decline was also impacted by a slight increase in marketing spending targeted at high value customers  partially offset by a billion settlement of disputes relating to obligations resulting from the sale of at t universal card services to citigroup in  as well as cost control initiatives 
in  we expect the impacts of revenue decline to continue to negatively impact ebit and ebitda 
ebit and ebitda both declined billion  or  in compared with the declines primarily reflect the decline in the long distance business  offset somewhat by cost control initiatives 
in addition  the declines reflect billion of lower gains on sales of businesses  due primarily to the sale of language line services  and higher restructuring charges 
reflecting our cost control initiatives  ebit and ebitda margins in improved to and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  in other items in  capital additions decreased million  or  compared with capital additions decreased billion  or  in compared with as a result of reduced spending on internal use software  as most of the functionality upgrades were completed in total assets declined billion  or  in the decline was primarily due to lower accounts receivable  reflecting lower revenue

results of operations for the year ended december   include a full twelve months of mediaone operations  while the year ended december   includes the results of mediaone since its acquisition on june   and the year ended december   does not include any results of mediaone 
additionally  the results of operations for the year ended december   include months of tci s results  reflecting its acquisition in march  while and include a full months of tci s results 
revenue at t broadband revenue grew billion in  or  compared with approximately billion of the increase was due to the acquisition of mediaone  partially offset by the net dispositions of cable systems 
in addition  the increase was attributable to revenue growth from advanced services broadband telephony and high speed data of approximately billion and growth in other video services  primarily expanded basic cable and digital video  of approximately billion 
we expect revenue to increase as demand for advanced services continues to grow 
at t broadband revenue grew billion in  or  compared with approximately billion of the increase in revenue was due to the acquisition of mediaone in and tci in in addition  revenue from advanced services and a basic cable rate increase contributed approximately billion to the revenue increase 
at december   at t broadband serviced approximately million basic cable customers  passing approximately million homes  compared with million basic cable customers  passing approximately million homes at december  the decrease in the number of homes passed and basic cable customers primarily reflect the net disposition of cable systems in in addition  the number of basic cable customers declined due to the impacts of competition 
at december   we provided digital video service to approximately million customers  high speed data service to approximately million customers and broadband telephony service to approximately million customers 
this compares with approximately million digital video customers  approximately million high speed data customers  and approximately thousand broadband telephony customers at december  these amounts reflect the acquisition of mediaone 
at december   at t broadband serviced approximately million basic cable customers  passing approximately million homes 
at december   we provided digital video service to approximately million customers  high speed data service to approximately thousand customers and broadband telephony service to nearly  customers 
ebit ebitda the ebit deficit in increased billion to billion from the deficit of billion 
the increased deficit was largely due to the impacts of the acquisition of mediaone and the net dispositions of cable systems of approximately billion  as well as a billion impact of net losses on the sales of businesses and investments recorded in compared with net gains recorded in in  we recorded net losses from the sale of cable properties to comcast  as well as a loss on the sale of part of our ownership interest in cablevision 
in  we recorded a gain on the sale of lenfest and gains on the sales of properties to cox and comcast 
also contributing to the increased deficit were higher depreciation and amortization  programming and advertising expenses and higher restructuring and other charges of approximately billion  as well as greater investment impairment charges of billion 
these increases to the deficit were partially offset by billion of lower pretax equity losses  improved ebit of approximately billion in other video services  primarily expanded basic cable and digital video  and improved ebit in advanced services of approximately billion 
ebitda  which excludes net losses related to equity investments and other income expense  was billion in  an improvement of billion compared with billion in this improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of mediaone of billion and improved ebitda in other video services  primarily expanded basic cable and digital video  of approximately billion and improved ebitda in advanced services of approximately billion 
partially offsetting this improvement was the impact of net dispositions of cable systems of billion  increased programming and advertising expenses of billion  and higher restructuring and other charges of billion 
in  we expect ebitda  which excludes net losses related to equity investments and other income expense  to increase as a result of expense reductions generated from previous years restructuring charges as well as continued growth from advances services broadband telephony and high speed data 
ebit in was a deficit of billion  an improvement of billion  or compared with this improvement was due to approximately billion of higher gains on sales of businesses and investments  primarily gains on the swap of cable properties with cox and comcast and the sale of our investment in lenfest  and billion lower restructuring charges primarily associated with an in process research and development charge recorded in connection with the acquisition of tci 
also contributing to the improvement were lower pretax losses from equity investments of billion  due in part to a billion improvement from our investment in cablevision due to gains from cable system sales 
these improvements were largely offset by the impact of the acquisition of mediaone and tci of approximately billion and higher expenses associated with high speed data and broadband telephony services of approximately billion 
ebitda  which excludes net losses related to equity investments and other income  was billion in  an improvement of billion compared with this improvement was due to the impact of the mediaone and tci acquisitions of billion and lower restructuring charges of billion 
higher expenses associated with high speed data and broadband telephony of approximately billion partially offset these increases 
other items capital additions decreased billion  or  to billion in  from billion in this decrease was primarily driven by a billion decrease in capital expenditures combined with a billion decrease in infusions into nonconsolidated investments 
the spending was primarily related to the growth and support of advanced services and plant upgrade expenditures 
capital additions increased to billion in  from billion in the increase was due to higher capital expenditures of billion  primarily due to mediaone  which was almost entirely offset by decreased contributions to various nonconsolidated investments of billion 
the spending was primarily related to the growth and support of advanced services and plant upgrade expenditures 
in  spending was largely directed toward cable distribution systems  focusing on the upgrade of cable plant assets  as well as equity infusions into various investments 
total assets at december   decreased billion  or  to billion compared with billion at december  the decrease in total assets was primarily due to lower franchise costs as a result of the net disposition of cable systems and the current year amortization  lower investments  primarily related to the impairment of and settlement of exchangeable notes with vodafone adrs  the sale of certain investments  including shares of cablevision and rainbow media and unfavorable mark to market adjustments on certain investments  and lower other assets primarily due to unfavorable mark to market adjustments on certain derivative instruments  and the amortization of purchased intangibles 
corporate and other this group reflects the results of corporate staff functions  the elimination of transactions between segments  as well as the impacts of excite home 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions revenue ebit   ebitda   capital additions  at december  total assets   revenue revenue for corporate and other primarily includes negative revenue of billion in both and  representing the elimination of intercompany revenue  and revenue of excite home of billion in and billion in the increase in revenue of excite home is primarily due to nine months of revenue included in our results compared with four months of revenue included in our results 
the elimination of intercompany revenue was essentially flat in compared with  however  we had a higher elimination of intercompany revenue in resulting from increased sales from at t business services and excite home to at t broadband  offset by lower intercompany revenue from at t wireless due to its split off on july  corporate and other revenue was negative billion in both and revenue in primarily included billion of negative revenue  representing the elimination of intercompany revenue  and revenue of excite home of billion 
revenue in primarily included billion of negative revenue representing the elimination of intercompany revenue 
ebit ebitda ebit and ebitda deficits in increased billion and billion to deficits of billion and billion  respectively 
the deficit increases were largely due to billion of greater investment impairment charges  which included a billion impairment charge for netphone and a billion impairment charge for time warner telecom recorded in  and billion of expense due to the adoption  in  of sfas no 
also contributing to the deficit increases were higher restructuring and other charges other than excite home and higher transaction costs associated with at t s restructuring announced in october  totaling billion  lower net gains on sales of investments and lower interest income  totaling billion  and a lower pension credit income and higher postretirement expense of billion 
these increases to the deficits were largely offset by the improved ebit and ebitda of excite home of billion primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in by excite home and at t related to excite home  partially offset by a billion greater loss in on the excite home put obligation with cox and comcast 
in  ebit and ebitda deficits increased billion and billion to billion and billion  respectively 
the increases in the deficits were largely related to excite home 
in  restructuring and other charges  net of minority interest  were billion higher primarily due to goodwill impairment charges recorded by excite home and at t related to excite home 
other impacts included a charge of approximately billion for the fair market value increase of put options held by comcast and cox related to excite home  and operating losses from excite home 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in the pension credit due to a higher pension trust asset base resulting from increased investment returns  and lower expenses associated with our continued efforts to reduce costs  which aggregated approximately billion 
in addition  higher net gains on sales of investments and an increase in interest income increased ebit and ebitda by approximately billion 
other items capital additions decreased billion in and increased billion in the spike in capital additions in was driven by our investment in netphone 
total assets increased billion  to billion in the increase was primarily driven by a higher cash balance at december   mainly a result of proceeds received from our billion bond offering in november  and an investment in at t wireless which was monetized in the fourth quarter of 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of excite home  the write down of our investment in netphone and the transfer of a loan to concert to the at t business services segment  which was written off in the third quarter of liberty media group lmg produces  acquires and distributes entertainment  educational and informational programming services through all available formats and media 
lmg is also engaged in electronic retailing services  direct marketing services  advertising sales relating to programming services  infomercials and transaction processing 
lmg was split off from at t on august  the operating results of lmg were reflected as equity losses earnings from liberty media group in the consolidated statements of income prior to its split off from at t 
our investment in lmg was included in the consolidated balance sheet at december  losses from lmg were billion in through july   the deemed effective split off date for accounting purposes  compared with earnings of billion in the decline was primarily due to gains on dispositions reported in  including gains associated with the mergers of various companies that lmg had investments in 
gains were recorded for the difference between the carrying value of lmg s interest in the acquired company and the fair value of securities received in the merger 
partially offsetting the decline were charges recorded on lmg s investments in  to reflect other than temporary declines in value 
in  lmg also recorded income of billion for the cumulative effect of accounting change representing the impact of separately recording the embedded call option obligations associated with lmg s senior exchangeable debentures due to the adoption of sfas no 
in  earnings from lmg were billion  compared with losses of billion from the date of acquisition through december  the improvement was primarily due to gains on dispositions  including gains associated with the mergers of various companies that lmg had investments in 
in addition  lower stock compensation expense in compared with contributed to the improvement  partially offset by impairment charges recorded on lmg s investments to reflect other than temporary declines in value and higher losses relating to lmg s equity affiliates 
liquidity for the years ended december  dollars in millions cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations    used in investing activities of continuing operations    used in provided by financing activities of continuing operations    provided by used in discontinued operations    net cash provided by operating activities of billion for the year ended december   primarily included the billion of income from continuing operations  adjusted to exclude noncash income items and net gains on sales of businesses and investments  and a decrease in accounts receivable of billion  partially offset by net changes in other operating assets and liabilities of billion and a decrease in accounts payable of billion 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion for the year ended december   primarily included income from continuing operations  excluding noncash income items and the adjustment for net gains on sales of businesses and investments of billion  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of billion and a decrease in accounts payable of billion 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion for the year ended december   primarily included income from continuing operations excluding noncash income items and the adjustment for net gains on sales of businesses and investments of billion  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of billion and net changes in other operating assets and liabilities of billion 
at t s investing activities resulted in a net use of cash of billion in  compared with billion in during  at t spent billion on capital expenditures and billion on nonconsolidated investments and received approximately billion  primarily from the net dispositions of cable systems  and approximately billion from the sales of investments 
during  at t used approximately billion for acquisitions of businesses  primarily mediaone  and spent billion on capital expenditures 
during  at t spent approximately billion on capital expenditures  approximately billion on acquisitions of businesses  primarily agns  and contributed billion of cash to lmg 
during  net cash used in financing activities was billion  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of billion in during  at t made net debt payments of billion  paid at t wireless billion to settle an intercompany loan in conjunction with its split off from at t  and paid dividends of billion 
partially offsetting these outflows was the receipt of billion from the issuance of convertible preferred stock to ntt docomo 
during  at t received billion from the at t wireless group tracking stock offering and had net borrowings of debt of billion 
these were partially offset by the payment of billion in dividends 
in  at t had net borrowings of debt of billion and received billion from the issuance of redeemable preferred securities 
these sources of cash were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury shares of billion and the payment of dividends of billion 
since the announced restructuring plans to create four new businesses  at t s credit ratings have been under review by the applicable rating agencies 
as a result of this review  in  at t s short term and the long term ratings were downgraded as outlined below 
these actions have resulted in an increased cost of borrowings and decreased our access to the capital markets 
our current credit ratings are as follows short term credit long term credit characterization of long term credit rating agency rating rating credit rating standard poor s a bbb on credit watch with negative implications moody s p a under review with possibility of downgrade fitch ratings f a rating watch negative there are provisions in several of our debt instruments that require us to pay up to the billion present value of future interest payments if our credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade 
we do not believe downgrades below investment grade are likely to occur 
in november  we completed a billion private bond offering which includes provisions that would allow bondholders to require at t to repurchase the notes if certain conditions are not met in conjunction with the spin off or other separation of at t broadband from at t at the time of notification to bondholders of the intention to separate at t broadband 
these conditions include a maximum debt to ebitda ratio adjusted for pro forma at t  excluding at t broadband  of no more than times 
in addition  the moody s and standard poor s credit ratings for pro forma at t  excluding at t broadband  are required to be at least baa and bbb  respectively  with such ratings having at least a stable outlook 
on december   we amended and restated a pre existing revolving credit facility 
the amended facility  which is syndicated to banks  makes billion available to at t for a day term 
at december   we had not utilized this facility  and we currently have the entire billion facility available to us 
the credit facility agreement contains a financial covenant that requires at t to maintain a net debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement not exceeding to for four consecutive quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
at december   we were in compliance with this covenant 
if at t were to become noncompliant it could result in the cancellation of the credit facility with any amounts outstanding under the credit facility becoming payable immediately 
the holder of certain private debt has an annual right to cause at t to repay up to the billion face value of the debt upon payment of an exercise fee 
in exchange for the elimination of this put right for  at t will obtain a letter of credit collateralized by billion of cash which will be restricted in its use 
the creditor could also accelerate repayment of the debt if unfavorable local law changes were to occur in its country of operation 
if at t s debt ratings are further downgraded or any of the risks or covenants noted above are triggered  at t may not be able to obtain sufficient financing in the timeframe required  and or such replacement financing may be more costly or have additional covenants than we had in connection with our debt at december  in addition  if the financial markets become more cautious regarding the industry ratings category we operate in  our ability to issue commercial paper would be further reduced 
this could negatively impact our ability to pursue acquisitions  make capital expenditures to expand our network and cable plant or to pay dividends 
at december   we had current assets of billion and current liabilities of billion 
included in current assets was billion of cash and cash equivalents 
included in current liabilities was billion of debt maturing within one year  including billion of commercial paper and debt with an original maturity of one year or less 
we expect to fund our operations primarily with cash from operations  cash on hand  commercial paper and our securitization program 
if economic conditions worsen or do not improve and or competition and product substitution accelerate beyond current expectations  our cash flow from operations would decrease  negatively impacting our liquidity 
in addition  potential sources of funds include the sale of our ownership interest in twe 
on february   we exercised our registration rights in twe and formally requested twe to begin the process of converting the limited partnership into a corporation with registered equity securities 
on may   we named credit suisse first boston as our investment banker for the registration process under the twe partnership agreement 
if the proposed spin off of at t broadband occurs as currently structured  our investment in twe will be included in the net assets spun off 
in the event our cash flow from operations or access to the commercial paper markets are negatively impacted  we have alternative funding available through the utilization of our billion credit facility  as long as we are in compliance with certain covenants discussed above and our billion receivables securitization program  which is limited by eligible receivables that change from month to month 
subsequent to december   at t notified holders of certain trust originated preferred securities  originally issued by tci and mediaone  that it will call these securities for early redemption on february   march  and april  these debt redemptions total approximately billion and will be funded with cash on hand 
such amounts are included within short term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at december  on february   at t signed an agreement with at t latin america ala that restructured approximately million of ala s short term and long term debt and preferred stock held by at t  plus accrued interest and dividends 
at december   million of the million financing was not drawn 
ala s senior secured vendor financing of million became effective on march  the at t provided debt and preferred facilities are subordinated to the ala senior secured vendor financing 
the agreement between at t and ala  which also took effect on march   extends the maturity and redemption dates of all ala debt and preferred stock payable to at t to october in addition  while the vendor financing is outstanding  the agreement defers interest payments on all at t debt and dividend payments on at t preferred stock until october if the proposed spin off of at t broadband occurs as currently structured  the debt of tci and mediaone will be included in the net assets spun off and will be included in at t comcast 
the amount of this third party debt at december   was billion 
the intercompany debt of at t broadband payable to at t that is outstanding at the time of the spin off will be repaid immediately prior to the spin off 
at december  such intercompany debt amounted to approximately billion 
in addition  at t s quarterly convertible income preferred securities  which had a book value of billion at december   will be included in the net assets spun off and will be included in at t comcast 
the following summarizes at t s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities a      operating leases b  unconditional purchase obligations c d e f g   total contractual cash obligations      a long term debt excludes debt that is exchangeable or collateralized by securities monetized debt since at t has the option to settle this debt in shares or cash 
amounts due less than one year were million  two to three years  million  and four to five years  million at december  in addition  debt excludes discounts and excess of fair value over the recorded value of debt in connection with the tci and mediaone mergers 
b under certain real estate operating leases  we could be required to make payments to the lessor up to million at the end of the lease term lease terms range from through 
the actual amount paid  if any  would be reduced by amounts received by the lessor upon remarketing of the property 
c at t has contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from local exchange carriers with terms greater than one year 
these contracts are based on volumes and have penalty fees if certain volume levels are not met 
we assessed our minimum exposure based on penalties to exit the contracts 
at december   penalties to exit these contracts in any given year totaled approximately billion 
d at t has contractual obligations that extend through for services that include computer application design  development and testing as well as the operation of a data center that hosts many of the computer applications operated throughout at t 
these contracts are based on the level of services we require and include termination fees if the level of services required is reduced in excess of limits outlined in the agreements 
these contracts also include termination fee clauses if we exit the contracts 
since these contracts are based on the level of services we require  we assess our minimum exposure based on the termination fees to exit the contracts which decline each year throughout the term of the contracts 
if we elect to exit these contracts  the maximum termination fees we would be obligated to pay in the year of termination would be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in or million in e in connection with the decision to unwind concert  at t has agreed to acquire the interest of at t canada owned by british telecommunications plc bt and assume bt s portion of the obligation to purchase the at t canada shares not already owned by at t and bt 
we do not know the timing or amounts we will have to pay in connection with this obligation but  in  at t recorded a liability of billion reflecting the estimated loss on at t s commitment to purchase the publicly owned shares of at t canada 
f at t broadband is party to an agreement under which it purchases certain billing services from csg systems  inc csg 
unless terminated by either party pursuant to terms of the agreement  the agreement expires on december  the agreement calls for monthly payments which are subject to adjustments and conditions pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreements 
g in  at t broadband s predecessor  tci  entered into a year affiliation term sheet with starz encore group pursuant to which at t may be obligated to pay fixed monthly amounts in exchange for unlimited access to all of the existing encore and starz programming 
the future commitment  which is calculated based on a fixed number of subscribers  increases annually from in to in and will increase annually through with inflation  subject to certain adjustments  including increases in the number of subscribers 
the amounts in the above table do not take into account any increase in subscribers or expected inflation 
the affiliation term sheet further provides that to the extent starz encore group s programming costs increase above certain levels  at t s payments under the term sheet will be increased in proportion to the excess 
excess programming costs that may be payable by at t in future years are not presently estimable and could be significant 
commitments by period total amounts less than after other commercial commitments committed year years years years dollars in millions guarantees   risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  as well as changes in equity prices associated with previously affiliated companies 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the prices of securities  some of which we have monetized through the issuance of debt 
on a limited basis  we use certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  options  forwards  equity hedges and other derivative contracts  to manage these risks 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with board approved policies 
we enter into foreign currency contracts to minimize our exposure to risk of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
we are subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as debt issued  recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions 
as of december   our foreign currency market exposures were principally canadian dollars  euros  japanese yen  swiss francs and brazilian reais 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the purposes of assessing specific risks  we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
for contracts outstanding at december  and  a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing rates would have resulted in an incremental pretax net unrealized loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase of the change from last year is primarily due to approximately billion of foreign exchange contracts entered into relating to the commencement of a euro commercial paper program and our obligation to purchase the outstanding at t canada shares we do not own 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transactions 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a parallel shift in all foreign currency exchange rates  although exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
additionally  the amounts above do not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions  because all variables other than the exchange rates are held constant in the calculations 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we monitor our interest rate risk on the basis of changes in fair value 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the debt due to differences between the market interest rates and rates at the inception of the obligation 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate long term debt to assess the risk of changes in fair value 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a hypothetical parallel shift in all interest rates 
at december  and  assuming a increase in interest rates  the fair value of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged debt would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
in both and  we entered into combined interest rate forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated debt 
assuming a downward shift in interest rates  the fair value of the contracts and the underlying hedged debt would have changed by million and million respectively 
assuming a downward shift in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of unhedged debt would have increased by billion and billion  respectively 
we have certain notes which are indexed to the market price of equity securities we own 
certain of these notes contain embedded derivatives  while other debt is issued in conjunction with net purchased options 
changes in the market prices of these securities result in changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
assuming a downward change in the market price of these securities  the fair value of the combined collars and underlying debt would decrease by million and million at december   and respectively 
because these collars hedge the underlying equity securities monetized  we believe that the increase in the fair value of the collars would be largely offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying equity securities 
the changes in fair values referenced above do not represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions because all variables other than the equity prices were held constant in the calculations 
we use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity prices associated with stock appreciation rights sars of previously affiliated companies 
assuming a decrease in equity prices of these companies  the fair value of the equity hedges net liability would have increased by million and million at december  and  respectively 
because these contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that the decrease in fair value would be largely offset by decreases in the underlying sar liabilities 
in order to determine the changes in fair value of our various financial instruments  including options  equity collars and sars  we use certain financial modeling techniques  including black scholes 
we apply rate sensitivity changes directly to our interest rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign currency forward contracts 
the changes in fair value  as discussed above  assume the occurrence of certain market conditions  which could have an adverse financial impact on the company 
they do not consider the potential effect of changes in market factors that would result in favorable impacts to us  and do not represent projected losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
future impacts would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency rate risk or equity price risk in the near future 
financial condition at december  dollars in millions total assets   total liabilities   total shareowners equity   total assets decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to the split off of lmg in august and at t wireless in july in addition  the decrease was due to lower investments and related advances resulting from the write down of concert and netphone  and unfavorable mark to market adjustments on certain investments as well as the sale of other investments  lower franchise costs as a result of the net disposition of cable systems and amortization  and lower goodwill  primarily driven by the impairments associated with excite home  as well as amortization 
partially offsetting these decreases was a higher cash balance  primarily reflecting proceeds from our billion bond offering in november total liabilities decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of lower debt  due to repayments  partially offset by our bond offering 
in addition  deferred income taxes were lower  primarily resulting from deferred tax assets recorded as a result of the write down of concert  our obligation to purchase all of the outstanding shares of at t canada and cable systems sales  partially offset by a higher deferred tax liability associated with greater tax depreciation 
also contributing to the total liability decrease was the settlement with at t common stock of the excite home put obligation with cox and comcast 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in other long term liabilities and deferred credits recorded in the third quarter of for our obligation to purchase all of the outstanding shares of at t canada 
minority interest decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to excite home 
due to the significant losses of excite home  we fully utilized the minority interest balance during the third quarter of  and therefore no longer have a minority interest balance related to excite home 
total shareowners equity decreased billion  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to the split off of lmg  the net impacts of the split off of at t wireless and net losses from continuing operations 
the decrease was partially offset by the issuance of stock to settle the excite home put obligation with cox and comcast 
in september and december  when at t declared its quarterly dividends to the at t common stock group shareowners  the company was in an accumulated deficit position primarily as a result of the split off of at t wireless 
as a result  the company reduced additional paid in capital by billion  the entire amount of the dividends declared 
the ratio of total debt to total capital for at t s continuing operations  excluding lmg debt of continuing operations divided by total debt of continuing operations and equity excluding discontinued operations and lmg was at december   compared with at december  for purposes of this calculation  equity includes the convertible trust preferred securities  as well as subsidiary redeemable preferred stock and excludes the equity of discontinued operations and lmg at december  in addition  included in debt of continuing operations was approximately billion and billion of notes at december  and  respectively  which are exchangeable into or collateralized by securities we own 
excluding this debt  the debt ratio for at t s continuing operations at december   was  compared with at december  the lower debt  as well as increased equity drove the decreases in the debt ratios 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations which supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  sfas no 
establishes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on at t s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which supercedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
in addition  the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to years 
sfas no 
is effective for at t as of january  in connection with the adoption of this standard  at t s unamortized goodwill balance and excess basis related to equity method investments will no longer be amortized  but will continue to be tested for impairment 
the goodwill balance as of december   was billion  and the related amortization in was billion 
the excess basis balance at december   was billion  with related amortization in of million 
in addition  we have determined that our franchise costs are indefinite lived assets  as defined in sfas no 
 and therefore will not be subject to amortization beginning in the balance of our franchise costs as of december   was billion and the related amortization for was billion 
the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our future operating results due to the cessation of goodwill and franchise cost amortization 
for  the amortization of goodwill  excess basis and franchise costs had an approximate impact of per share 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
as of january   the fair value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded their carrying value  and therefore no impairment loss will be recognized upon adoption 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the franchise costs were tested for impairment as of january   by comparing the fair value to the carrying value at market level 
an impairment loss of billion  net of taxes of billion will be recognized as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires that obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  this liability is accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  for at t  this means that the standard will be adopted on january  at t does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on at t s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and consequently amends apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
based on sfas no 
 sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale  as well as addresses the principal implementation issues 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
also amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
sfas no 
is effective for at t as of january  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on at t s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
subsequent events in march  at t canada announced the formation of a committee of the board of directors to help at t canada with issues they are facing in the foreseeable future 
such issues include a significant regulatory decision expected in the next month which could have a significant impact on the future of sustainable competition in canada  the effect of at t satisfying its obligation to purchase the share of at t canada it does not own  and the impact of these events on operating and financial results of at t canada 
in addition  the committee appointed financial advisors to evaluate various scenarios regarding issues  opportunities and alternatives for at t canada 
it is expected that the outcome of these evaluations will have a negative effect on the underlying value of at t canada shares  which will result in at t recording up to million of additional losses on its commitment to purchase the publicly owned shares of a t canada  excluding any impact of the floor price accretion
