item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  institutions such as the bank which are insured by the bank insurance fund bif  are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current bif base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  bif member banks such as the bank must pay an amount toward the retirement of the financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
this amount fluctuates but for the first quarter of is basis points cents per of insured deposits 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending service and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance in june  and received a satisfactory cra assessment rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  the bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquiror would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to the accelerated consolidation of the banking industry 
while many large out of state banks have already entered the california market as a result of this legislation  it is not possible to predict the precise impact of this legislation on the bank and the company and the competitive environment in which they operate 
financial modernization act effective march  the gramm leach bliley act eliminated most barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  and enabled full affiliations to occur between such entities 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdicia prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
the company has no current intention of becoming a financial holding company  but may do at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time 
the gramm leach bliley act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the gramm leach bliley act also imposes significant new requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen us law enforcement s and the intelligence communities ability to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the potential impact of the act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations  including 
due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  
standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  
rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  
reports by nonfinancial trades and business filed with the treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding  and  
filing of suspicious activities reports securities by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating us laws and regulations 
the company is not able to predict the impact of such law on its financial condition or results of operations at this time 
other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the company  the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bank to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the company or the bank would be affected thereby 
risk factors statements and financial discussion and analysis by management contained throughout this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements herein include  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
poor economic conditions may cause us to incur losses 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in the san joaquin valley in central california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in the san joaquin valley may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the san joaquin valley has not experienced the same type of growth that has occurred in other areas of california  especially those where high tech industries have taken hold 
unemployment levels remain relatively high  especially in tulare county  which is our geographic center and the base of our agriculturally oriented communities 
the united states entered into an economic recession in  and california s silicon valley and other high tech areas have been particularly impacted 
while the current national recession has not necessarily worsened economic conditions in the san joaquin valley  the company s level of non performing assets increased in anyway due mainly to lingering agricultural difficulties 
because of increased global competition and other factors  excess supply and low prices characterize the markets for many agricultural products 
if current recessionary conditions continue or deteriorate  we expect that our level of non performing assets could increase further 
poor economic conditions affecting particular industries could have an adverse effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us 
we are also affected by certain industry specific economic factors 
for example  a significant portion of our total loan portfolio is related to real estate obligations  particularly commercial real estate loans 
a downturn in the commercial real estate industry in california could have an adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  a sizable portion of our total loan portfolio is to borrowers either directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry 
while a great number of our borrowers may not be individually involved in agriculture  many of the jobs in the san joaquin valley are ancillary to the regular production  processing  marketing and sales of agricultural commodities 
the ripple effect of lower commodity prices for milk  olives  grapes  tree fruit and oranges has a tendency to spread to lower land prices  lower borrower income  and lower collateral values 
in addition  weather patterns are of critical importance to row crop  tree fruit  and orange production 
a degenerative cycle of weather and commodity prices can impact consumer purchasing power  which has the potential to create further unemployment throughout the san joaquin valley 
such conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our borrower base and negatively impact our business 
the california energy crisis may adversely impact our customers 
california experienced severe energy shortages in  which resulted in rolling blackouts in certain instances in portions of the state 
poor economic conditions as a result of energy shortages in the areas where our customers are located could adversely affect our borrower base  and consequently  may negatively impact our business 
the issue of energy shortages has been resolved  to some extent  but the prices paid by consumers and businesses for energy have increased significantly in many cases 
while the full impact has not yet been determined  these price increases could cause customers of the bank to experience losses or go out of business  which could result in delinquencies and losses on loans made to our borrowers and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may incur risks as a result of our growth 
our company s total assets increased from million at december   to million at december   with most of the growth occurring in the fourth quarter of the year 
management s intention is to leverage the company s current infrastructure to sustain the momentum achieved in latter part of  although no assurance can be provided that this strategy will result in significant growth 
our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to 
monitor operations  
control funding costs and operating expenses  
maintain positive customer relations  and 
attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve those objectives in an efficient and timely manner we may experience disruptions in our business plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
changing interest rates may reduce our net interest income 
banking companies earnings depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors which influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of nonperforming assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services 
the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread could be expected to decline during times of falling interest rates  but could also be adversely impacted if interest rates increase 
therefore  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a negative effect on our results of operations 
intense competition exists for loans and deposits 
the banking and financial services business in california generally  and in our market area specifically  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers 
we compete for loan  deposit  and financial services customers with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions and other non bank financial service providers 
many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services than we do  which creates certain competitive disadvantages for the company 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market for our stock does not develop 
although sierra bancorp s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since august  the effective date of the holding company reorganization and bank of the sierra s common stock was previously listed on the nasdaq national market since june   trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
inasmuch as the company did not acquire the outstanding shares of the bank until august   the financial information contained throughout this annual report for and earlier is for the bank only 
information for is for the company on a consolidated basis unless otherwise stated 
because the price of our common stock may vary widely  when you decide to sell it  you may encounter a delay or have to accept a reduced price 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate widely  depending on many factors 
some of these factors have little to do with our operating results or the intrinsic worth of our company 
for example  the market value of our common stock may be affected by the trading volume of the shares  announcements of expanded services by us or our competitors  operating results of our competitors  general trends in the banking industry  general price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  acquisition of related companies  or variations in quarterly operating results 
also  if the trading market for our common stock remains limited  that may exaggerate changes in market value  leading to more price volatility than would occur in a more active trading market 
as a result  if you want to sell your common stock  you may encounter a delay or have to accept a reduced price 
adverse effects of banking regulations or changes in banking regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are governed by significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of our investors 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by these regulations  and our business may be adversely affected by any future changes in laws  regulations  policies or interpretations 
laws  regulations or policies currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time  and regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations 
the allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses 
we try to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans  nevertheless losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following 
industry standards  
historical experience with our loans  
evaluation of economic conditions  
regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  
regular reviews of delinquencies  and 
the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level which we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it will hurt our business 
in addition  the fdic and the department of financial institutions  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the department of financial institutions could also hurt our business 
our directors and executive officers control almost a majority of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of december   our directors and executive officers together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the bank s outstanding voting stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they could most likely control the outcome of most corporate actions  such as 
approval of mergers or other business combinations  
sales of all or substantially all of our assets  
any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  
issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  
incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  
the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  and 
payment of dividends on common stock or other equity securities 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following 
a requirement that certain business combinations not approved by our board of directors receive the approval of two thirds of the outstanding shares  
staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  
the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and 
a requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on the our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of the company

c dividends as a bank holding company which currently has no significant assets other than its equity interest in the bank  the company s ability to declare dividends depends primarily upon dividends it receives from the bank 
the bank s dividend practices in turn depend upon the bank s earnings  financial position  current and anticipated cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the bank s board of directors at that time 
the company paid quarterly cash dividends totaling million or per share in and million or per share in  representing and  respectively of the prior year s earnings 
as the holding company reorganization became effective on august   all of the dividends paid prior to that date were paid by the bank  rather than the company 
since  the bank or the company  as applicable has inasmuch as the company did not acquire the outstanding shares of the bank until august   the information contained herein for and part of is for the bank s stock 
as of the effective date of the holding company reorganization august   each outstanding share of common stock of the bank was converted into one outstanding share of common stock of the company 
generally adhered to a policy of paying quarterly cash dividends totaling about of the prior year s net earnings to the extent consistent with general considerations of safety and soundness  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the bank s or the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  the bank experienced significant growth in  due mainly to its acquisition of sierra national bank in may of that year  and also had a slight contraction in earnings in the calendar year 
in light of these events  the board of directors declared dividends in totaling only approximately of the prior year earnings 
the company anticipates paying dividends in the future consistent with the general dividend policy as described above 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the power of the bank s board of directors to declare cash dividends is also limited by statutory and regulatory restrictions which restrict the amount available for cash dividends depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the bank  as well as general business conditions 
under california banking law  the bank may declare dividends in an amount not exceeding the lesser of its retained earnings or its net income for the last three years reduced by dividends paid during such period or  with the prior approval of the california commissioner of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the payment of any cash dividends by the bank will depend not only upon the bank s earnings during a specified period  but also on the bank meeting certain regulatory capital requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law prohibits the company from paying dividends on the common stock unless i its retained earnings  immediately prior to the dividend payment  equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or ii immediately after giving effect to the dividend the sum of the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would be at least equal to of its liabilities not including deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred liabilities and the current assets of the company would be at least equal to its current liabilities  or  if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years  at least equal to of its current liabilities

the purchase of snb was a strategic decision meant to improve the company s long term potential 
gains on the sale of investment securities were responsible for approximately half of the increase in net income in the increase in net earnings in was also achieved through increased net interest income  gains from the sale of loans and loan servicing  a reduction in the loan loss provision which occurred in spite of an increase in the level of non performing loans see non performing assets  and the implementation of expense controls during the course of the year 
for  net income was million  compared to the million earned in and net income of million in net income per share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets roa was and return on average equity roe was in  as compared to 
and  respectively in  and and  respectively for perhaps the most significant single factor impacting the company s performance in was the federal reserve board s record reduction in the target overnight fed funds rate and discount rate  although this negative factor was more than offset by the combination of positive factors discussed elsewhere in this section 
the federal reserve board s rate reductions injected liquidity into the banking system  which forced other market interest rates to decline in response 
as is typical in many other community banks  the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted as market rates fell 
the rate related decline in net interest income  however  was mitigated by the increased income generated by a higher level of average earning assets and favorable changes in the company s deposit mix  and net interest income increased by  from to moreover  the decline in market rates boosted the company s volume of mortgage loans  some of which we were able to sell at a substantial gain  and increased the value of the bank s investment portfolio  a portion of which was also sold with realized gains 
as the holding company reorganization pursuant to which the company became the sole shareholder of the bank was effective in august   all financial information as of and for the years ended december  and any earlier years or periods relates to the bank rather than the company 
information as of and for the year ended december  is provided for the bank and the company on a consolidated basis 
the company s lower loan loss provision is  on the surface  inconsistent with the increase in non performing assets and higher aggregate loan balances  and the company s allowance for loan losses fell as a percentage of loans and as a percentage of non performing loans 
actual loan losses  however  declined in  and management s detailed analysis of the adequacy of the allowance provides justification for the amounts added to the allowance by means of the loan loss provision during the year 
due in part to an increase in operating expenses associated with the snb acquisition  the company undertook a thorough review of its major expenses in early as a result of this effort  certain cost cutting measures were implemented during the year  including a staff reduction program 
the company also decided to sell its mortgage servicing to reduce associated expenses and realize non recurring gains 
it is anticipated that these expense controls will continue to enhance the company s profitability in subsequent years  although no absolute assurance can be given that this  in fact  will occur 
on november   sierra capital trust i  a newly formed delaware statutory business trust and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the trust  issued an aggregate of  of principal amount of floating rate trups r capital trust pass through securities of the trust  which in turn were used to purchase the same amount of subordinated debt securities issued by the company 
these trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital when calculating regulatory risk based capital ratios 
the issuance of the trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of  coupled with relatively slow asset growth during most of  resulted in substantial improvement in the company s capital ratios 
proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities were used to increase the capital of the bank and for general corporate purposes 
the bank is now considered to be well capitalized pursuant to the fdic s prompt corrective action guidelines 
we anticipate that this increase in capital will provide a springboard for future asset growth  while allowing the bank to maintain its well capitalized position 
there can be no absolute assurance given that this in fact will occur  however  as numerous local market  general economic and regulatory changes could impact capital ratios going forward 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin during the company generated net income of million as compared to million in and million in the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income brought about by income from the successful deployment of earning assets less the costs of interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which generally comes from customer service charges and fees  but can also result from non customer sources such as gains on loan sales and gains on sales from the company s investment portfolio 
the majority of the company s expenses are operating costs which relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income  which is simply total interest income including fees less total interest expense  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this represents an increase of in over and an increase of in over going forward  the million in trust preferred securities  which currently bear an interest rate of  are expected to add approximately  per year to the company s interest expense  although the rate adjusts every six months and this amount will likely vary somewhat 
the company will be able to maintain a positive interest spread on these funds  however  by leveraging this additional regulatory capital to increase loan balances 
the amount by which total interest income exceeds total interest expense depends on several factors 
among those factors are yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volume of total earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is referred to as volume change 
change in interest rates earned on assets and rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds is referred to as rate change 
the volume and rate variances table which follows sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average interest rates 
the calculation is as follows the change due to increase or decrease in volume is equal to the increase or decrease in the average balance times the prior period s rate 
the change due to an increase or decrease in the rate is equal to the increase or decrease in the average rate times the current period s balance 
the variances attributable to both the volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change in rate

loans are gross of the allowance for possible loan losses  deferred fees and related direct cost

non accrual loans have been included in total loans for purposes of total earning assets 
during  the company s net interest margin was impacted by two primary factors  one negative and one positive 
the main negative factor was the overall decline in interest rates which caused net interest income to fall by million 
a large portion of the bank s loans carry variable rates and re price immediately  versus a large base of core deposits which are generally slower to re price  creating timing differences as interest income fell more rapidly than interest expense 
exacerbating the timing effect was the narrowing of the relative spread between loan and deposit rates as market rates moved significantly lower 
the company s net interest margin actually showed improvement toward year end  however  as floors on loan rates kicked in and deposit rates were lowered to match similar decreases in competitor rates 
demand for deposits has proven to be relatively inelastic  possibly because insured bank deposits are currently viewed as a safe haven relative to alternative investment products 
however  as depositors feel more secure with alternative investments the company could be forced to pay increasingly more for deposits to avoid potential run off  even if other interest rates remain static 
the primary positive factor impacting the company s net interest margin was the favorable shift in the mix of the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the company ran an advertising campaign targeting variable rate money market deposits early in  which not only attracted new depositors but also enticed some existing customers with maturing time deposits to roll their money into money market accounts 
average time deposit balances fell by nearly million from to  while money market account balances increased by million 
although a relatively high promotional rate was initially paid on money market deposits  that rate fell as market interest rates dropped during the course of the year 
even more significantly  though  average demand deposit balances increased by million  or  from to  which had a substantial positive impact on the company s net interest margin 
from to  the company s average loan portfolio grew by approximately million  or  with earnings on that growth  net of associated funding costs  contributing to net interest income 
the increase in the annual average balance is lower than the million increase in ending balances  since most of the growth in occurred in the last two months of the year 
this growth spurt should provide a solid base for earnings growth in  however  although no assurance can be given that this will prove to be the case 
additionally  loan balances  which are the highest yielding component of the company s earning assets  have become an increasingly larger portion of the company s average asset base over the past three years 
during the loan portfolio averaged of total assets  while for and such balances represented and  respectively  of average assets 
the reverse of this trend is that average investment balances have declined relative to total assets  from in  to in and in despite their decline relative to total assets  a shifting of investment balances into higher yielding mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds during has also helped support the company s net interest margin 
there were three major items having a negative impact on the company s net interest margin in  which fell by more than basis points relative to first was the fact that interest bearing liabilities increased in proportion to interest earning assets  while other liabilities and equity both declined relative to average earning assets 
the second was the general market and competitive conditions which caused an approximate basis point increase in the cost of time deposits  which comprised a significant portion of interest bearing liabilities in the third was the decline in the yield on the loan portfolio  which was caused primarily by a disproportionate increase in real estate loans  the lowest yielding segment of the company s portfolio in based on current economic conditions  the company expects moderate changes in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and rates earned on both the investment and loan portfolio during the company s net interest margin is anticipated to stay approximately the same as in  and net interest income should increase if loans grow as planned and the loan growth is funded by reasonably priced deposits 
however  no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 
non interest income and non interest expense the primary traditional sources of non interest income for the company are service charges on deposit accounts  gains on the sale of loans  loan servicing income  and credit card fees 
during  the company also realized substantial gains on the sale of investment securities and the sale of loan servicing rights 
service charges on deposit accounts and loan sales income in accounted for and  respectively  of total non interest income  as compared to and  respectively  for this decrease was due to the significant increase in gains from the sale of loan servicing  and gains from the sale of investment securities 
loan servicing income including gains on servicing sales and credit card fees for were and respectively  as compared to and  respectively  during non recurring gains on the sale of investment securities increased from to of total non interest income from to  but are expected to diminish significantly in the primary source of non interest income continues to be service charges on deposit accounts 
the company s ratio of service charge income on deposit accounts to average transaction accounts demand and interest bearing now accounts increased to in  as compared to for and in this increase is indicative of operational changes enacted in recent years to generate additional non sufficient funds charges  a higher level of collected versus waived activity charges  and a lower number of service charge free accounts 
loan sales income increased proportionate to total non interest income due to the high volume of mortgage loans booked and sold during mortgage loan activity increased presumably as a result of the relatively low rates available on such loans  and it is not expected that this level of loan sales income will be sustained in loan servicing income increased as well  as non recurring gains were realized on the sale of the bulk of the company s servicing rights 
pursuant to a detailed analysis of the loan servicing area  management determined that loan servicing revenue was not sufficient to cover associated costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin  and decided to sell the servicing rights on its residential loan servicing portfolio 
we expect that loan servicing revenues will drop off substantially in  although associated expenses will also decline 
credit card fees increased slightly from to  but were approximately the same percentage of average earning assets 
with no plans for significant growth in credit card receivables  it is expected that credit card fees will stay at about the same level in the decline in market interest rates had the effect of increasing the market value of the company s investment portfolio  which is substantially comprised of fixed rate bonds  and the company was able to realize some of those gains as bonds were sold during the year 
management had determined at the beginning of that the portfolio should be repositioned to improve its total return  by moving balances from lower yielding treasuries and agencies into municipal bonds and mortgage backed securities to the greatest extent possible 
as bonds were sold during the year in pursuit of this strategy  the company realized gains on those sales totaling approximately million  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
not all of the proceeds from investment portfolio sales and maturities were reinvested in bonds  as evidenced by the million decline in the total investment portfolio balance during the company is increasingly focused on enhancing its fee income to mitigate the effects of a declining net interest margin 
based on the company s efficiency ratio of for  for  and for as compared to the and lower ratios of certain major financial institutions  it is expected that this activity will continue for the foreseeable future 
the company s total non interest expense increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in the overall increase in non interest expenses is due in large part to the company s acquisition of snb in may of in a full year of the post acquisition increase in operating expenses is reflected in the company s income statement  whereas in only those expenses subsequent to the acquisition date are included 
the largest dollar increase in non interest expenses was in professional services costs  which more than doubled from million to million 
included in professional services costs are about  in costs associated with forming the holding company in this category also includes payments to consultants for compliance  loan  and operations reviews  which increased by  due to the increased size and complexity of the company 
the bank s fdic assessment also increased by  from to  due to the increase in the bank s assessable deposit base as well as the lower capital ratios that resulted from the snb acquisition 
it is expected that the fdic assessment will decline in  since financial reports filed with regulators at the end of reflect improvement in the company s capital position 
however  assessment rates are subject to change and there is no guaranty that the anticipated reduction will indeed occur 
the second largest dollar increase in non interest expense was in salaries and employee benefits  which increased by  or  from to the main reason for this increase is that reflects a full year of the additional expense associated with staffing the four offices added through the snb acquisition 
based on market analysis and peer comparisons  it is management s opinion that the company can achieve significant growth in loans and deposits with only minimal increases in staff 
thus  it is expected that salaries and employee benefits will decline as a percentage of earning assets over the next few years  although there is no guaranty that this will actually occur 
in addition  pursuant to a comprehensive analysis of various operating units  staff reductions were implemented in mid and full time equivalent employees declined from at the end of to at the end of this decline portends a much more modest increase in salaries and benefits in  although no assurance can be given that this  in fact  will occur 
rent and occupancy expense increased by  or  from to the main reason for this increase is that reflects a full year of the additional depreciation and other occupancy expenses associated with the four offices added through the snb acquisition  as well as the renovation and maintenance expenses incurred to bring those offices up to company standards 
other operating costs increased by nearly  or  the second largest percentage increase for non interest expense categories 
most of the increase was in telephone and data communications costs  which increased subsequent to the snb acquisition but have also increased as the company has upgraded its communications technology 
these costs are currently being reviewed in detail  and telephone and data line configurations are expected to be restructured to increase efficiencies and decrease costs  although no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 
data processing costs also experienced a significant increase from to  climbing from million to million 
this increase was centered in item processing costs  which grew by  due to the additional number of items processed in versus item processing costs as a percentage of total non interest expense have increased from in  to in  to in management has researched various alternatives in order to reduce item processing costs  and plans to implement an in house item processing solution in the latter part of it is expected that  all else being equal  this solution will significantly reduce item processing costs starting in  however there can be no assurance that this expense reduction will actually occur

the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan losses through charges to earnings 
the charges are shown in the income statements as provisions for loan losses  and specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the company s provisions in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the provision was reduced by million in despite an increase in non performing loans 
a lower amount was added to the company s allowance for loan losses in because net charge offs also fell by  and the allowance was maintained at a level determined to be appropriate subsequent to a thorough management review of the allowance relative to the company s current loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision is determined by a conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan losses 
income taxes as indicated in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is the sum of two components  current tax expense and deferred tax expense 
current tax expense results from applying the current tax rate to taxable income  and is in essence the actual current income tax liability 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  however  leading to differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary timing differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense 
most of the company s temporary differences involve recognizing more expenses in its financial statements than it has been allowed to deduct for taxes  and therefore the company normally carries a net deferred tax asset on its books 
at december  the company s net deferred tax asset was primarily due to temporary differences in the reported allowance for loan losses  deferred compensation  and depreciation 
the company s income tax expense is also affected by the extent of tax exempt securities income  which arises primarily from the company s investments in state  county and municipal bonds 
this portion of the portfolio averaged of the total in  and provided million in tax exempt income 
in the company also committed to an approximate million investment in wnc institutional tax credit fund x  a low income housing partnership  which should result in approximately million in net total tax credits over its year life 
about  of those tax credits should be realized in  although all of the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with complete certainty 
in addition  in the company reevaluated the interest income earned on its loans to companies whose operations are located in areas designated as enterprise zones by the state of california 
this interest income is partially exempt from california income taxes  and the company expects to reduce its tax liability by taking advantage of this exemption 
however  changes in state law could preclude this exemption and there is no guaranty that it can or will be sustained going forward 
financial condition a comparison between the summary year end balance sheets for through was presented previously in the table of selected financial data see item above 
as indicated in that table  the company s total assets  loans  deposits  and shareholders equity have grown each year for the past four years  with asset growth most pronounced in as a result of the acquisition of snb 
the four branches acquired with snb currently have million in loans and million in deposits  which comprise and  respectively  of the company s total loans and total deposits at december  growth in the company s total assets over the past year approximated million  or  as compared to growth in of million  or 
also of importance is the fact that total loan balances  which are typically higher earning assets than investment securities  have increased relative to total interest earning assets every year since and currently stand at of interest earning assets 
moreover  interest earning assets increased from of total assets at year end to at year end these trends signify more efficient deployment of assets 
on the liability side  the deposit mix changed significantly in and the increased weighting of lower cost funding sources had an obvious positive impact on the bank s cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the company had also increased its reliance on wholesale funding sources at year end  although this was an intentional asset liability management strategy and should be a temporary condition 
rather than build deposit balances in anticipation of loan growth  the company funded loan growth with short term brokered deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
we are now focusing on increasing customer deposits to replace wholesale borrowings 
loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category 
at december   gross loans represented of total assets  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the quality and diversification of the company s loan portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s results of operations 
the selected financial data table in item above reflects the net amount of loans outstanding at december st for each year between and the loan distribution table which follows sets forth the amount of the company s total loans outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated 
the amounts shown in the table are gross figures and do not include net deferred loan fees or net deferred loan origination costs for all periods presented 
loan distribution as of december  dollars in thousands agricultural      commercial and industrial      real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development      secured by residential properties      secured by farmland      held for sale      total real estate      small business administration loans      consumer loans      credit cards      total loans      percentage of total loans agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland held for sale total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards as reflected in the loan distribution table  aggregate loan balances have increased nearly million  or  over the last five years  with a major portion of the increase occurring in the past two years 
all of the company s million in loan growth in was generated by existing business units  however only about two thirds of the company s total million loan growth during was from then existing branches  while the remainder was due to the acquisition of four branches of snb 
the largest percentage growth during came in commercial loans including sba loans  while the largest dollar volume increase was in loans secured by real estate 
loan growth in the company s immediate market has been oriented toward commercial loans  including sba loans  as well as loans secured by real estate  including commercial and professional buildings and single family dwellings 
as a result  these areas have comprised the major portion of the company s loan growth over the past few years 
loans secured by real estate grew by million  or  and commercial loans grew by million  or  during  although most of this growth occurred in the last quarter of the year 
loans secured by real estate and commercial loans comprised and  respectively  of the bank s total loan portfolio at the end of the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in the markets where the company has a presence 
additionally  the company has a business unit dedicated to its sba product and is very active in specific sba program lending  and also sells a number of the sba loans it originates 
during  the company generated over million in sba loans 
further  the company is designated an sba preferred lender  which allows greater flexibility to meet small business loan requests with a more timely credit approval process 
on september   bank of the sierra was named small business friendly lender in california for by the office of advocacy of the small business administration 
this award is made to financial institutions whose loan portfolio shows a propensity of lending to small businesses defined as a commercial loan under million  with a focus on small business loans under 
this award lends credence to the company s success in meeting the needs of smaller business owners in the communities in which the company conducts its banking activities 
this dedication to sba lending was recently reaffirmed when bank of the sierra was named the top sba lender in the fresno district in the last quarter of  and tied for first in the number of loans for the fresno district during the sba s fiscal year 
the most significant shift in the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has been in loans secured by commercial properties  which increased from of total loans at the end of to of total loans at the end of real estate lending is an increasingly important part of the company s focus  and is likely to remain so for the immediate future 
real estate loans secured by farmland  however  declined to just of total loan balances by the end of from at the end of  and agricultural loans dropped during the same period to of the company s total loan balances from 
the decline in agricultural loans over the last few years has been due in part to the december freeze  along with reduced local plantings due to foreign competition 
however  the company has also withdrawn from financing production lines  where year to year cash flow variations can impede the ability of borrowers to meet contractual repayment terms 
with uncertain commodity prices  our borrowers have faced declining equity in farming operations  and some are removing themselves from farming by selling land for housing and other development 
consumer loans represented of total loans at december  and of total loans outstanding at december  the million  or growth in these balances came primarily from the purchase of million in balances outstanding on unsecured lines of credit to high net worth individuals 
the purchase  from a los angeles area financial institution  was consummated in december of the remaining balances consist primarily of automobile and unsecured lines of credit  which have gained popularity due to their ease of use 
the company has encountered a great deal of competition for consumer lending products  and has developed a program for lending to people rather than lending on property 
as a result  relationship lending has increased as a portion of overall consumer credit  and is exemplified by home equity lines  other revolving consumer credit facilities and credit card lines 
however  a great deal of consumer credit is now granted in the form of home equity lines  which allow a more favorable treatment of interest costs 
as a result  consumer credit separately reported is only for term debt and unsecured lines  not inclusive of home equity lines  a more growth oriented category 
such consumer oriented debt  secured by home equity  is captured within the total reported for real estate loans secured by residential property 
credit card loans represented of total loans outstanding at december   having declined from of total loans at december  during  the company sold its agent program participant loans to another servicing entity and discontinued issuing cards for other banks 
the fifteen bank agent program had represented about of total credit card loans outstanding 
despite this decrease  the credit card segment of the company s loan product group remains an important part of the company s overall customer relationship lending strategy 
another important aspect of the company s loan business has been that of residential real estate loans which have been generated internally by the real estate mortgage loan department and then sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or other long term lenders 
the company has consistently been among the largest real estate mortgage lenders in tulare county for the past ten years 
during  the company originated and sold aggregate balances of approximately million of such loans  an increase from the million originated and sold in this changed in march  when the company began to earn referral fees for directing residential mortgage customers to moneyline but ceased originating and selling those loans itself 
the company also originates and sells agricultural mortgage loans to certain other investors  and the volume of these loans serviced totaled million as of december  total loans serviced for others numbered with an aggregate balance of million at december  as compared to  loans with an aggregate balance of million at the end of in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit as long as there are no violations of any condition established in the contractual arrangement 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december  as compared to million at december  these commitments represented of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively  net of credit card lines available which were million and million  at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit at december   and were million and million  respectively  which represented approximately of total commitments outstanding at the end of and at the end of because the company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment  its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through its lending activities 
the company s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure to avoid any significant loss or liability related to environmental regulations 
loan maturities the following loan maturity table shows the amounts of total loans and leases outstanding as of december   which  based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due within three months  after three months but less than one year  after one but within five years  and in more than five years 
the principal balance of loans due after one year is indicated by both fixed and floating rate categories 
non accrual loans are intermixed within each category 
loan maturity dollars in thousands as of december  three floating fixed three months one over rate rate months thru twelve to five five due after due after or less months years years total one year one year agricultural        commercial and industrial        real estate        consumer loans       credit cards     total        includes small business administration loans this schedule  which aggregates contractual principal repayments by time period  can be used in combination with the investment maturities table in the investment securities section and the deposit maturities table in the deposits section to identify time periods with potential liquidity exposure 
the referenced maturity schedules do not convey a complete picture of the company s re pricing exposure or interest rate risk  however 
for details on the re pricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet and a more comprehensive discussion of the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  see the liquidity and market risk section 
non performing assets banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain investments which the company may purchase have the potential of becoming less valuable as the conditions change in the obligor s financial capacity to repay  based on regional economies or industry downturns 
as a result of these types of failures  an institution may suffer asset quality risk  and may lose the ability to obtain full repayment of an obligation to the company 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
the company achieves a certain level of loan quality by establishing a sound credit plan  which includes defining goals and objectives and devising and documenting credit policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures identify certain markets  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
unfortunately  however  the company s asset quality risk may be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values and trends in particular industries or more geographic markets 
the company s internal factors for controlling risk are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with our loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
as a multi community  independent bank headquartered in and serving tulare county with a smaller presence in each of kern  fresno and kings counties  the company must contend with the attendant vagaries of the california and san joaquin valley markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered during the last several years due to the impact of a national economic recession  consumer bankruptcies  weather related agricultural loan losses  and depressed prices for agricultural goods  however the san joaquin valley may be experiencing a slow but sustained economic recovery 
the company is optimistic that the local economy will continue to improve over time  but no assurance can be given that such improvement will in fact continue 
non performing assets are comprised of loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a deferral of interest or principal and other real estate owned oreo 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they become days past due 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
management s classification of a loan as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full collectibility of principal or interest on the loan  at that point  the company stops recognizing income from the interest on the loan and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid 
these loans may or may not be collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the date indicated 
non performing assets dollars in thousands as of december  nonaccrual loans agricultural commercial and industrial  real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland   consumer loans credit cards subtotal     loans days or more past due still accruing as to principal or interest agricultural   commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland held for sale consumer loans credit cards subtotal   total non performing loans     other real estate owned     total nonperforming assets      restructured loans n a n a n a n a n a nonperforming loans as of total gross loans nonperforming assets as a of total gross loans and other real estate owned additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded for the year ended december  if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended or  if not outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended  since origination 
includes small business administration loans a restructured loan is one where the terms were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
total non performing balances stood at million at the end of  and more than of those balances are agriculture related 
even though non performing loans have increased relative to total loans since  the company s actual level of net loan losses has declined over the same period see allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs to average loans fell from in  to 
in and 
in  although no assurance can be given that this favorable trend will continue 
the company s non performing assets increased by million during  primarily due to the placement on non accrual status of approximately million in loans to a single borrower 
management considers those loans to be well reserved see allowance for loan losses below  and expects to resolve them during another mitigating factor when evaluating the company s non performing assets is the fact that over million including million of the million in loans discussed above of the balances are secured by real estate  and an additional million is comprised of the guaranteed portion of loans which are backed by the us government 
although the company s overall level of non performing loans increased substantially  the level of oreo was reduced during from million to  this decrease was the result of aggressive sale activities undertaken to dispose of oreo properties 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of known and inherent risk in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectable  recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off 
we employ a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses that includes a monthly review process and monthly adjustment of the allowance 
our process includes a periodic review of individual loans that have been specifically identified as problem loans or have characteristics which could lead to impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools 
while this methodology utilizes historical and other objective information  the establishment of the allowance for loan losses and the classification of loans is also to some extent based on management s judgment and experience 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity prices as well as acts of nature freezes  earthquakes  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of the agriculture industry and other key industries in the central san joaquin valley 
the way a particular loan might be structured  the extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  and the rate of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered 
the table which follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands as of december  balances average gross loans outstanding during period      gross loans outstanding at end of period      allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of period      adjustments  provision charged to expense      loan charge offs agricultural  commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans credit card loans  total      recoveries agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans credit card loans total net loan charge offs     balance at end of period      ratios net loan charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to gross loans at end of period allowance for loan losses to non performing loans net loan charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses allowance acquired from sierra national bank includes small business administration loans 
at december   the company s allowance for loan losses was million 
the loan loss provisions in   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
although the provision was lower  the  in net loans charged off in was also  lower than in  thus the allowance for loan losses increased by  from the end of to the end of the allowance did  however  decline from to of total loans  despite the increase in the ratio of non performing loans to total loans from 
to see non performing assets above 
the large increase in non performing loans also caused the allowance to fall from of non performing loans at the end of to at the end of if the million in non performing loans to a single borrower discussed in the previous section are resolved in the manner expected by management  and if the million in government guaranteed balances is excluded from the calculation  the allowance to non performing assets ratio should again exceed 
however  no assurance can be given that this indeed will take place 
our methodology for determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loans losses is  and has been  consistently followed 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity  and expand our geographic coverage  we expect to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis we engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology  and to perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the company s external auditors  the fdic  and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination processes 
management believes that our current methodology is appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
further  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
however  fluctuations in credit quality  or changes in economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as necessary  and no assurance can be given that such factors may not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses and the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio

includes small business administration loans 
the company s year end allowance consists of a million specifically allocated allowance and a  unallocated allowance which is pro rated among the categories shown in the previous table 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the model and estimation risk associated with the allocated allowances  and management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining the allocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent loss under these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include the following at the balance sheet date 
the current business cycle and existing general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  economic and business conditions affecting our key lending portfolios  
seasoning of the loan portfolio  growth in loan volumes and changes in loan terms  and 
the results of bank regulatory examinations 
investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio  which had a book value of million at december   is the second largest component of the company s earning asset base  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is significant to any analysis of the financial condition of the company 
subsequent to implementing financial accounting standards board statement  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas on december   the company classifies its investments into two portfolios held to maturity  and available for sale 
while sfas also provides for a trading portfolio classification  the company has no investments which are so classified 
the held to maturity portfolio should consist only of investments that the company has both the intention and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status or other infrequent situations as permitted by sfas prior to  the company s long term tax exempt obligations and certain pledged treasury and agency issues were classified as held to maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  however  the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
upon adoption of this statement  the company reclassified substantially all of its investments from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
as a result  the company s unrecorded potential increase in market value net of tax effect was recorded on the balance sheet as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
such reclassification was completed in order to allow the company to more actively manage this portfolio 
the investment portfolio serves the following purposes it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers  it provides a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits and borrowed funds  it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak  and it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
securities pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law were million and million  for december  and  respectively 
the investment portfolio was reduced in size in  dropping to million at the end of the year from its starting balance of million 
the reduction was due to bonds which were sold to realize income statement gains  and maturing bonds and principal prepayments on mortgage backed securities which were not re invested on a dollar for dollar basis 
this million reduction added to the impact of increasing loan balances when viewing the weighting of both categories relative to interest earning assets 
while loans are generally higher yielding instruments and their increased weighting enhances the company s yield on earning assets  management does not anticipate letting investment balances drop further relative to total earning assets due to the investment portfolio s preferential liquidity characteristics 
the company s investment portfolio is composed primarily of us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  mortgage backed securities to enhance the yield of the portfolio  state  county and municipal obligations which provide limited tax free income and pledging potential  and other equity investments 
the relative distribution of these groups within the overall portfolio changed significantly in  with a shift out of treasuries and agencies and into mortgage backed securities and municipal obligations 
municipal obligations remain the largest portion of the total portfolio at  up from at the end of treasuries and agencies together comprised of total investments at the end of  down from at the end of  while mortgage backed securities increased proportionate to total investments in  to from 
this movement away from pure liquidity instruments into higher yielding bonds with a higher perceived risk and a longer duration helped the company minimize the impact of declining interest rates on the weighted average yield of the portfolio 
the portfolio yield fell to in from in  a drop of only basis points despite the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the fed funds rate during the year 
the company s available for sale group also includes certain equity investments  namely sphinx common stock and farmer mac stock 
the farmer mac investment is a required element to allow the company to sell certain agricultural loans to this quasi governmental agency  whereas the company s sphinx investment arose from its use of their integrated banking software 
in addition  the company holds certain other equity investments which are not readily marketable securities and thus are classified as other assets on the company s balance sheet 
these include investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares pcbb  lender services acquisition corporation  wnc institutional tax credit fund x  california economic development lending initiative  community bankers insurance agency  llc  and the federal home loan bank 
the company s million investment in lender services acquisition corporation lsac was made during lsac is owned primarily by a consortium of california bank holding companies  none of which holds voting shares in excess of of the total voting stock of lsac 
lsac is a holding company for certain title insurance companies which operate mainly in california and which derive a portion of their revenues out of referrals from the banks which own lsac 
the company s investment in wnc institutional tax credit fund x totals million and is more fully described in the income taxes section

cash and due from banks cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks represent the major portion of the company s non earning assets 
at december  these areas comprised of total assets  as compared to of total assets at december  this decline is indicative of the company s efforts to reduce non earning balances while increasing interest earning assets 
these efforts will continue in  with a focus on the reduction of vault cash and required reserves at the federal reserve bank 
there are  however  geographic limitations which limit our ability to reduce the number of cash items in process of collection 
the company s operating branches lie at the southern extremity of the federal reserve bank frb of san francisco s responsibility area of check clearing activities  while the company s item processing activities are performed in the fresno and walnut locales  fresno lies within the frb s san francisco region  while walnut is within the frb s los angeles branch office s responsibility area 
as a result  a greater volume of the company s balances with correspondent banks have been uncollected funds  and therefore due from bank balances have traditionally been greater than similar size institutions in more metropolitan areas where collection activity is more centralized 
however  if and when the federal reserve banks start accepting electronic items ie  imaged checks for collection  this geographic disadvantage will be removed 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related lease  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the following premises and equipment table reflects the balances by major category of fixed assets premises equipment as of december  dollars in thousands accumulated net book accumulated net book accumulated net book cost depreciation value cost depreciation value cost depreciation value land       buildings          leasehold improvements      construction in progress furniture and equipment          total          although the net book value of the company s premises and equipment declined slightly in  there was a million increase in the level of investment in premises and equipment during land and buildings increased with the addition of the four snb branches  and additional computer hardware was placed in service to accommodate the increase in locations 
as a percentage of total assets  however  the company s premises and equipment have declined to  from at the end of and at the end of deposits information concerning the average balance and average rates paid on deposits by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the distribution  rate  and yield table located in the previous section on results of operations net interest income and net interest margin 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost core deposits  namely non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words their propensity to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are large certificates of deposits  which generally means time deposits with balances exceeding  because these deposits particularly when considered together with a customer s other specific deposits may exceed fdic insurance limits  depositors may select shorter maturities to offset perceived risk elements associated with deposits over  the company s community oriented deposit gathering activities in the central san joaquin valley  however  have engendered a less volatile than usual base of depositor certificates over  the preponderance of maturities of jumbo deposits are within the three months or less time frame  although most of the customers with such time deposits have been with the company for over two years 
the company s total deposit volume actually declined slightly to million at the end of  as compared to million at the end of deposit growth of million was achieved during  however  both as a result of the acquisition of four snb branches and the growth of the other twelve branches within the system 
the company is currently promoting higher rates on time deposits in certain geographic locations to generate additional customer deposits with longer maturities  and reduce reliance on borrowed funds 
despite the overall drop in deposit balances  money market deposits increased by nearly million  or  due in large part to a promotional campaign run early in total time deposits declined by million  or during the year 
money market deposits and time deposits comprised and  respectively  of total deposits at the end of  versus and  respectively  of total deposits at the end of with rates declining as they did during  this movement into variable rate money market deposits had a positive impact on the company s net interest margin 
balances which might have otherwise been locked in time deposits at higher rates were instead in money market instruments which were re priced downward frequently during the course of the year 
rates paid on more liquid money market deposits are usually lower than those paid on time deposits 
however  interest rates changed to the point where  by year end  the cost of time deposits with a maturity of less than one year were equivalent to or less than rates on money market deposits 
to take advantage of current interest rate dynamics  the company is conducting a marketing campaign targeting time deposits 
we expect that this promotion will generate approximately million in additional deposits with an approximate one year maturity  although no assurance can be given that this will actually occur 
another favorable volume variance came in non interest demand deposits 
demand deposits increased by million  or  and increased from to of total deposits during likewise  interest bearing demand deposits  or now accounts  increased by million  or  and grew from to of total deposits 
our reliance on overnight fed funds purchased increased at the end of as compared to  as well  although this source of funds had become inexpensive relative to traditional deposit sources by the end of the year 
the scheduled maturity distribution of the company s time deposits as of december  was as follows deposit maturity distribution as of december  dollars in thousands three three six one over months to six to twelve to three three or less months months years years total time certificates of deposits        other time deposits       total       less than in addition to the deposit liabilities available in the local market  the company provides a non deposit cash management product to its commercial business customers 
this product group is categorized as a non deposit sweep account  and at december   the company s financial statements reflected million in repurchase agreements  which represent such sweep accounts 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected approximately million in repurchase agreements  secured by pledged investments held segregated from the company s own securities portfolio 
as a result of their overnight investment aspect  the cost of these sweep accounts has generally been lower than the company s interest expense for longer term funds 
it is anticipated that while this product will remain an important aspect of the company s service capacity 
other borrowings the company utilizes other short term borrowing to fund loan growth when longer term deposit growth has not kept pace with customer loan requests 
in addition  short term borrowings may be used to purchase additional investments when anticipated maturity dates are near term  or when additional liquidity is required to support higher customer cash utilization levels  as was the case at december  due to yk considerations 
short term borrowings principally include overnight fed funds purchased  which at the end of consisted exclusively of advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements which generally mature in one day 
the details of these borrowings for the years   and are presented below short term borrowings fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements dollars in thousands balance at december    average amount outstanding    maximum amount outstanding at any month end    average interest rate for the year fhlb advances dollars in thousands balance at december    average amount outstanding    maximum amount outstanding at any month end    average interest rate for the year capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  comprised of million in common stock  million in retained earnings  and million in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total shareholders equity at the end of was million 
net income has provided million in capital over the last three years  of which million or approximately was distributed in dividends 
the retention of earnings has been the company s main source of capital since  however the company issued million in trust preferred securities in  the proceeds of which are considered to be tier capital for regulatory purposes but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company paid quarterly cash dividends totaling million or per share in and million or per share in  representing and  respectively of the prior year s earnings 
as the holding company reorganization became effective on august   all of the dividends paid prior to that date were paid by the bank  rather than the company 
since  the bank or the company  as applicable has generally adhered to a policy of paying quarterly cash dividends totaling about of the prior year s net earnings to the extent consistent with general considerations of safety and soundness  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the bank s or the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  the bank experienced significant growth in  due mainly to its acquisition of sierra national bank in may of that year  and also had a slight contraction in earnings in the calendar year 
in light of these events  the board of directors declared dividends in totaling only approximately of the prior year earnings 
the company anticipates paying dividends in the future consistent with the general dividend policy as described above 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities the company s trust preferred securities are currently at the maximum includible limit of of tier capital  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale  which are carried at fair market value 
tier capital includes preferred stock and certain types of debt equity  which the company does not hold  as well as the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
for a more detailed definition  see item  business supervision and regulation capital adequacy requirements herein 
at december   the company had a tier risk based capital ratio of  a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
the company had a tier risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of at december  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides more detailed information concerning the company s capital amounts and ratios as of december  and the fdic also places each financial institution it regulates into one of five capital categories  depending on the institution s risk based capital ratios for more detailed information  see item  business supervision and regulation prompt corrective action provisions herein as of december   the bank had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage capital ratio of 
the bank is currently well capitalized by regulatory standards  although it was classified as adequately capitalized for much of the year 
in  with the addition of snb assets of about million and additional growth of about million  the bank s growth far outstripped its rate of capital accumulation and its regulatory capital rating fell 
additionally  with the purchase of snb for cash  the bank created an intangible asset that is deducted from the bank s reported gaap capital for regulatory purposes 
however  with the accumulation of retained earnings and the addition of regulatory capital via the issuance of trust preferred securities in  the bank s regulatory capital ratios improved substantially 
it is anticipated that the current level of capital will allow the bank to grow substantially and remain well capitalized  although no assurance can be given that this will be the case 
liquidity and market risk management the company must address on a daily basis the various and sundry factors which impact its continuing operations 
three of these factors  the economic climate which encompasses our business environment  the regulatory framework which governs our practices and procedures  and credit risk have been previously discussed 
there are other risks specific to the operation of a financial institution which also need to be managed  and this section will address liquidity risk and market risk 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain a cash flow adequate to fund operations  and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows  or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages its own liquidity in such a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities  without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is provided by the company s large base of core deposits  which were generated by offering traditional banking services in the communities in its service area and which have  historically  been a very stable source of funds 
the company s loan to deposit ratio jumped from at the end of to at the end of  primarily due to the surge in loan growth toward the end of which was funded with overnight borrowings from other banks 
the ratio has already shown improvement in early as overnight borrowings have been replaced by deposits  and was unaudited at the end of february at year end  the company s customers had also invested million in the company s sweep product  as compared to million at year end the company s liquidity ratio  which is a measure of liquid assets to deposits and short term liabilities  showed some level of deterioration during due to declining investment balances 
the liquidity ratio was at the end of december  but had dropped to by the end of management s goal is to maintain this ratio at or greater  and the investment portfolio is budgeted to increase to help achieve that target  although no assurance can be given that this will actually happen 
however  management is also of the opinion that the standby funding sources it has arranged are more than sufficient to meet the company s current and anticipated short term liquidity needs 
those sources include a formal borrowing line with the federal home loan bank  which is secured by certain of its real estate loans  and informal short term liquidity lines for overnight fed funds with certain correspondent banks 
the company also has the ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers  sell investment securities  or sell loans if required for liquidity purposes 
although the company s investment s are all classified as available for sale  not all could be used for liquidity should the need arise since approximately million of those balances are being pledged for various purposes 
because of the rapid pace of loan growth in the last quarter of  the company lacked sufficient time to generate customer deposits to fund that growth 
overnight borrowings from the federal home loan bank were used instead  as evidenced by the million increase in other borrowings at december  as compared to december  the company anticipates the restoration of balanced deposit growth both through the use of brokered deposits  which are currently relatively inexpensive relative to traditional customer deposit sources  and the current marketing campaign  which is targeting time deposits in specific geographic areas 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has risk management policies to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
in order to identify areas of potential exposure to rate changes  the company calculates its re pricing gap on a monthly basis 
it also performs an earnings simulation analysis and a market value of portfolio equity calculation on a quarterly basis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures than those apparent in the standard re pricing gap analysis 
the bancware modeling software is used by the company for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin 
these simulations can also provide both static and dynamic information on the projected fair market values of the company s financial instruments under differing interest rate assumptions 
the simulation program utilizes specific individual loan and deposit maturities  embedded options  rates and re pricing characteristics to determine the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and sustained change in rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  economic based on current trends and econometric models or stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company typically uses three standard interest rate scenarios in conducting the simulation  namely stable  an upward shock of basis points  and a downward shock of basis points 
the company s policy is to limit the change in the company s net interest margin and economic value to plus or minus upon application of interest rate shocks of bp  as compared to a base rate scenario 
as of december   the company had the following estimated net interest margin sensitivity profile immediate change in rate bp bp net interest income change   the above profile illustrates that if there were an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the company s annual net interest income would likely decrease by around  or approximately 
by the same token  if there were an immediate downward adjustment of basis points in interest rates  the company s net interest income would likely fall by approximately million  or  over the next year 
the relationship between the change in net interest income under rising and declining rate scenarios is typically expected to be inversely proportionate  and in fact the company has  in the past  been exposed to declining rates while benefiting in a rising rate environment 
however  certain balance sheet characteristics such as floors on loan rates and the current unusual interest rate environment have combined to create the current situation where the company s net interest income actually declines from base in a rising rate environment as well as a declining rate environment 
the company s interest rate risk profile has changed since december   when it displayed the following characteristics immediate change in rate bp bp net interest income change   short term market interest rates fell by basis points during the year and the company s net interest income fell by million due to negative rate variances  which provides a fairly good validation of the model s assessment of the company s exposure 
further  the economic value of the company s loan and deposit portfolios would also change under the interest rate variances previously discussed 
the amount of change is based on the profiles of each loan and deposit class  which include the rate  the likelihood of prepayment or repayment  whether its rate is fixed or floating  the maturity of the instrument and the particular circumstances of the customer 
the quantification of the change in economic value is somewhat apparent in note  fair value of financial instruments  in the consolidated financial report  however such values change over time based on certain assumptions about interest rates and likely changes in the yield curve
