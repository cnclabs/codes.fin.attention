amounts in thousands  except share and per share data  or as otherwise noted 
overview and outlook we are a diversified technology company whose business is to create  build and launch technology based businesses primarily from technologies developed for the government 
for more than years we have been providing information systems solutions and services to the department of defense dod and intelligence agencies 
today  we are organized into four segments  our core government business and our three commercial businesses  including our surebeam business  which was discontinued on october  that reflect the specific markets and industries in which we operate and our emerging technologies and businesses segment 
on october   titan adopted a definitive plan to spin off surebeam in the form of a tax free dividend to titan shareholders within months from that date 
the plan involves filing a letter ruling request with the internal revenue service seeking approval of the tax free distribution 
titan has filed the letter ruling request  and intends to execute the spin off as soon as practical following the receipt of a favorable ruling and all required third party consents 
titan has historically reported the surebeam business as a separate segment 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  the consolidated financial statements of titan for all periods presented have been restated to reflect surebeam as a discontinued operation 
segment segment description titan systems information technology and communications solutions  services and products for defense  intelligence  and other us and allied government agencies titan wireless satellite based and wireless based communication services and systems which provide cost effective voice  data and internet services in developing countries cayenta included in our software systems segment total services provider of information technology services and software product applications for its customers business and governmental functions  including retailing  finance  accounting  customer billing and collection  contract management  supply chain management and equipment monitoring and maintenance primarily in four vertical markets utility municipality  manufacturing and logistics  retail and transportation surebeam discontinued electronic food irradiation systems and services emerging technologies and businesses development of commercial applications and businesses using technologies created by titan 
we currently have several new businesses in development  including businesses in which we have applied for patent protection for the underlying technology the results of operations shown for each of our operating segments includes each of the segment s direct costs of operations and administration 
the segment performance is based upon profit or loss before interest expense  income taxes and before allocated costs of corporate overhead 
corporate overhead may include  among other things  costs for financial  accounting  marketing  administrative and legal activities incurred by titan 
consequently  the results of operations of the segments may not be indicative of the actual results that would be shown in the financial statements of these segments if prepared on a stand alone basis 
each of titan systems  titan wireless and cayenta is a subsidiary of ours 
we have created stock option plans for each of titan systems and titan wireless 
as of december   titan systems and titan wireless each had approximately of their fully diluted common stock that had been reserved for issuance under their plans 
at december   we controlled approximately of the voting power and approximately of the outstanding equity ownership of surebeam through our ownership of  shares of class b common stock 
surebeam completed its initial public offering of  shares of its class a common stock in march upon completion of the initial public offering of surebeam  the number of shares owned by titan represented approximately of the voting power of surebeam 
each class a share is entitled to one vote and each class b share is entitled to ten votes  with class a and class b shares voting together on all matters submitted to the vote of the holders of common stock 
as of december   surebeam had also reserved approximately  shares of class a common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
on december   million of surebeam s promissory note payable to titan was exchanged for  class b common shares of surebeam  and on february   the remaining million of surebeam s note payable to titan was exchanged for  class a and  class b common shares of surebeam 
after these transactions  we own  class a and  class b common shares  resulting in our control of approximately of the voting power and of the outstanding equity of surebeam 
we control approximately of the voting power of cayenta through our ownership of million shares of class b common stock  which represents approximately of cayenta s outstanding equity ownership 
each class a share is entitled to one vote and each class b share is entitled to ten votes  with class a and class b shares voting together on all matters submitted to the vote of the holders of common stock 
in addition to class a and class b common stock  cayenta has outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock that are convertible into its class a common stock and warrants for approximately  shares of its class a common stock that have a weighted average exercise price of per share 
as of december   cayenta had also reserved approximately of its fully diluted common stock under stock option plans 
titan systems titan systems provides and is expected to continue to provide the largest percentage of our consolidated revenues 
during the year ended december   titan systems had total revenues of million  which represented of our consolidated revenues for the period 
titan systems revenues have grown internally and through our well defined strategy of increasing our core competencies and expanding our customer base through acquiring government information technology companies as part of the general trend of the defense and government information technology industry consolidation 
titan systems backlog  including both funded and unfunded backlog  was approximately billion at december  although funded backlog represents only business which is considered to be firm  we cannot guarantee that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur 
funded backlog consists of the aggregate contract revenue remaining to be earned by us at a given time  but only to the extent such amounts have been appropriated by congress and allocated to the contract by the procuring government agency 
unfunded backlog consists of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as our customers incrementally allot funding to existing contracts  whether we are acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor  and the aggregate contract revenues to be funded on contracts which have been newly awarded to us 
unfunded backlog includes priced options  which consist of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as a result of a customer exercising an option period that has been specifically defined in the original contract award 
backlog is the total of the government and commercial funded and unfunded backlog 
the determination of unfunded backlog involves substantial estimation  particularly with respect to customer requirements and contracts 
these estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts  and we believe the use of such estimates to be reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that the unfunded contract value will be realized as contract revenue or earnings 
titan systems operating margin is affected by the mix of contract types cost reimbursement  fixed price or time and materials as well as by the mix of prime contracts versus subcontracts 
significant portions of titan systems contracts are time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
titan systems is reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and other direct expenses under time and materials contracts and reimbursed for all actual costs  plus a fee  or profit  under cost plus fixed fee contracts 
the financial risks under these contracts generally are lower than those associated with other types of contracts  and margins are also typically lower 
the us government also has awarded titan systems fixed price contracts 
such contracts carry higher financial risks because titan systems must deliver the contracted services at a cost below the fixed price in order to earn a profit 
of titan systems total revenues from government business in  approximately were generated by time and materials contracts  approximately were generated by cost reimbursement contracts  and approximately were generated by fixed price contracts 
on march   our subsidiary  titan systems corporation  consummated an agreement to purchase certain assets from maxwell technologies systems division  inc  a subsidiary of maxwell technologies  inc  which specializes in research  development and technical services primarily for military applications 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments and indemnification obligations  less a million holdback  due days from the date of closing

 business combinations  we have valued contracts in process at contract price  minus the estimated costs to complete and an allowance for the normal industry profit on its effort to complete such contracts which amounted to million 
this deferred profit has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as an increase to goodwill 
we recognized approximately million in the year ended december   as a reduction of costs  with the remaining million to be recorded as a reduction of costs in future periods as work on certain contracts is performed  which is estimated to be through fiscal on november   we completed the acquisition of btg  inc btg  a provider of information technology solutions and services primarily to the us military and other government agencies  for per btg share

the transaction was accounted for as a purchase  and the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
in connection with the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 we have valued contracts in process at contract price  minus the estimated costs to complete and an allowance for the normal industry profit on its effort to complete such contracts  which amounted to million 
this adjustment has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as an increase to goodwill and a corresponding offset to unbilled receivables 
the company recognized approximately million in the year ended december   as a reduction of costs  with the remaining million to be recorded as a reduction of costs in future periods as work on certain contracts is performed  which is estimated to continue through fiscal during  we consummated a merger with advanced communication systems  inc  or acs  in a stock for stock  pooling of interests transaction

we issued approximately  shares of common stock for all the outstanding shares of averstar common stock  and assumed averstar stock options representing approximately  shares of our common stock 
averstar s operations are primarily included in titan systems  with its avercom business being reported in the emerging technologies and businesses segment 
also during  we acquired pulse engineering pulse  lincom corporation lincom and sencom corporation sencom in transactions that were accounted for as purchases 
the excess of our purchase price for these entities over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over years  was approximately million at december   and is reflected as goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we describe our acquisitions in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for all acquisitions accounted for as purchases  the acquired companys results of operations are consolidated with the company s results of operations immediately subsequent to the acquisition date 
titan wireless titan wireless has historically generated most of its revenues by supplying communications systems and products and providing related integration services in developing countries 
titan wireless is increasingly generating revenues from providing communications services over its global communications network 
while the majority of service revenues are currently being generated from long distance carriers that use our network to carry their long distance communications traffic to and from developing countries  service revenues are starting to be generated from retail customers in developing countries 
in the retail business  titan wireless installs an on site antenna at businesses that use its fixed wireless systems for local and or long distance communications services 
the cost of that antenna and its installation is paid for either by titan wireless or its customers  depending on the terms of the business arrangement 
titan wireless derived approximately of its revenues during from providing communications services to long distance carriers

this segment s operating activities consist primarily of various early stage or developing commercial businesses in which we hold equity interests  including  in some cases  less than equity interests 
the businesses included in emerging technologies and businesses may change over time as we develop new commercial applications and transition those applications into businesses in which we hold a minority or controlling equity interest that becomes included in emerging technologies and businesses 
the businesses included in emerging technologies and businesses also change over time when we designate businesses that had been historically included in that segment as stand alone operating segments and as a result report their results of operations separately or when we sell or spin off businesses that have previously been included 
we also may move businesses that had been historically included in a different operating segment into emerging technologies and businesses when we consider it appropriate to include those businesses results of operations in emerging technologies and businesses 
examples of businesses currently included in our emerging technologies and businesses segment are lincom wireless and titan scan technologies  which are both subsidiaries of titan 
lincom wireless is a fabless semiconductor company focused on standards based solutions for wireless connectivity of voice  data  and video in the enterprise and home environments  whose core technologies and expertise were acquired as part of our acquisition of lincom during and then further developed by us

results of operations fiscal years ended december   and revenues consolidated 
our consolidated revenues increased from million in to billion in and from billion in to billion in increased revenues of million  million  and million were reported across our titan systems  titan wireless and emerging technologies and businesses segments  respectively in revenue growth in was primarily attributable to internal revenue growth in certain of our information and intelligence solutions and logistics management businesses in our titan systems segment  as well as to a lesser extent  the impact of the acquisitions of datron systems  inc datron and btg  inc btg made in in our titan systems segment  and to a lesser degree increased service revenues generated by titan s consolidated joint venture  sakon llc sakon in our titan wireless segment and revenues generated on titan s new contract with the united states postal service usps to provide mail sanitization systems in our emerging technologies and businesses segment 
these increases were partially offset by reduced revenues in cayenta  resulting from slower corporate spending on commercial information technology services 
revenue growth in was in part attributable to the impact of the acquisitions of sencom corporation sencom  pulse engineering pulse and lincom corporation lincom made in in our titan systems segment  the acquisitions of jb systems  inc doing business as mainsaver  assist cornerstone technologies  inc assist and sfg technologies  inc 
sfg made in the fourth quarter of by cayenta and other new business in our software systems which includes cayenta segment  and continued shipments of hardware to our customer in benin  africa in our titan wireless segment  in which we built a telecommunications system for the national telephone company 
titan systems 
titan systems revenues increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in the increase in reflects strong demand from the air force for information solutions support  and from the army for acquisition and logistics management  systems engineering for intelligence agencies  software test and evaluation  and a variety of other technical services  as well as assisting the navy in transformation initiatives  coupled with the impact of the acquisitions of datron and btg in the last half of the increase in reflects the impact of the acquisitions of sencom  pulse and lincom  as well as the acquisitions of system resources corporation src and atlantic aerospace electronics corporation aaec made in mid in addition  to a lesser degree  revenues were impacted by increased production of titan systems compact infantry signal intercept systems and increased demand for signal processing antennas  as well as increased demand for systems design and integration services from the air force  army and intelligence community 
titan wireless 
titan wireless revenues increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in increased service revenues in of million generated by titan s consolidated joint venture  sakon  in latin america  africa  and the middle east  and increased revenues of million in new international business  primarily in certain countries in africa  were offset by reduced revenues of approximately million on titan wireless project in benin to build a telecommunications system for its customer  the office of post and telecommunication of benin opt  as titan wireless completed the system during the revenues in recorded on this project are a result of the expansion of the original project to include increased gsm lines  expansion of the capacity and capability of the vsat sites and an overall increase of lines in the country of benin 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to titan wireless s contract with the opt  and  to a lesser extent  the increased services revenues generated by titan s consolidated joint venture  sakon llc  in latin america  africa  and the middle east 
software systems including cayenta 
software systems revenues increased from million in to million in and decreased from million in to million in the decrease in was driven by slower corporate spending on commercial information technology services and e business software applications  which resulted in reduced demand for cayenta s services and products 
the increase in was primarily driven by software license revenues from e commerce  asset management and revenue cycle management applications principally generated by the companies acquired by cayenta in the fourth quarter of  as well as by growth in cayenta s enterprise application business  including new work on an international systems integration project which contributed approximately million 
revenues from one federal agency accounted for approximately million  million and million of software systems revenues during  and  respectively 
emerging technologies and businesses 
emerging technologies revenues increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in the increase in is related to revenues of approximately million generated on titan s new contract with the us postal service to provide mail sanitization systems  partially offset by reduced revenues resulting from reduced demand in our avercom business  which was affected by slower corporate spending on commercial information technology services similar to cayenta  and reduced demand in our digitized fingerprint business 
the increase in was principally a result of the acquisitions of mjr and lincom wireless  a part of lincom  in march selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in and decreased from in to in the decrease in was due in part to reduced goodwill amortization from million in to million in and reduced deferred compensation from million in to million in excluding the goodwill amortization and deferred compensation  sg a increased slightly from in to in  reflecting increases in bid and proposal activity in our titan systems segment as well as increased infrastructure costs in our titan wireless segment 
the increase in is due to increased goodwill amortization of million  as well as an increase in deferred compensation of million 
excluding the impact of the amortization and deferred compensation  sg a increased from in to in research and development our r d expenses increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in the increased r d expenditures in were primarily related to development of software reprogrammable modems and network control software in our titan systems segment 
the increased r d expenditures in were principally incurred in our software systems segment to web enable and to develop added features and functionality for certain of our software applications within cayenta  and to a lesser degree  to develop the next generation xpress connection product within our titan wireless segment 
acquisition and integration related charges and other acquisition and integration related charges and other for the years ended  and are described in more detail below amounts in millions december  employee termination costs elimination of duplicate facilities and assets acquisition related transaction costs other costs non cash asset impairments pre acquisition contingencies net cash proceeds on sale of investment at december   a total of million of liabilities remained on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other accrued liabilities  related primarily to restructuring activities initiated in and we anticipate that the remaining liabilities will be paid in fiscal charges acquisition and integration related charges and other of million in were comprised of costs of million related to the integration of acs and averstar  and a realignment of business around the major categories of customers of titan systems  which together resulted in personnel reductions and the closing of several facilities 
included in these costs is approximately million of employee termination costs  million of costs to eliminate duplicate and excess facilities and assets  million of duplicate personnel costs to transition processes and functions  and million of asset impairment costs of certain asset balances for which the recoverability of such balances was impaired due to the exit of a satellite services business within the titan systems segment

the exercise of titan stock options also provided million 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement for million of financing from a syndicate of commercial banks 
the credit facility also allowed us to increase total availability by an additional million  if needed  for an aggregate of million 
the credit facility was subsequently amended on june  to provide for an increase in total availability for an additional million  for an aggregate total of million 
the proceeds of the loan were used in part to refinance outstanding indebtedness on our million credit facility arranged by bank of nova soctia in june the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets and guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than  in each case  surebeam and our foreign operations 
surebeam ceased being a guarantor and having its assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility following the completion of its initial public offering on march  the million credit facility is comprised of a six year senior secured multi draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  two seven year senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million  and a five year senior secured revolving credit facility in a aggregate principal amount of up to million 
loans made under the multi draw term loan facility mature on the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the credit facility  and amortize beginning in the credit facility s second year  which began with the quarter ended june  and ends with the quarter ending march   as follows quarterly in the third and fourth quarters of year two of the credit facility  quarterly in year three of the credit facility  quarterly in year four of the credit facility  quarterly in year five of the credit facility  quarterly in the first and second quarters of year six of the credit facility and in the third quarter of year six of the credit facility and on the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the credit facility

the agreement contains financial covenants that set maximum debt to ebitda limits and require us to maintain minimum interest and fixed charge coverages and levels of net worth 
at december   total borrowings outstanding under our credit facility were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
commitments under letters of credit were million at december   million of which reduce availability of our working capital line  resulting in million of availability on our working capital line at december  of the total borrowings  million was short term 
on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  titan africa  inc titan africa  in connection with its contract to build a satellite based telephone system for its customer  the national telephone company of benin  africa  entered into a loan facility agreement for up to billion francs cfa the currency of the african financial community  equivalent to approximately million us dollars  with a syndicate of five banks  with africa merchant bank as the arranger 
this medium term financing is a non recourse loan to titan africa which is guaranteed by the national telephone company of benin  africa and secured by the national telephone company s equipment and revenues related to the project 
the facility has a fixed interest rate of and will be repaid in seven equal semi annual payments from the net receipts of this project  or by the opt in the event that such receipts are not adequate to make these payments  which commenced on december  and were scheduled to end on december  the borrowings on this facility have been utilized to fund the subcontractor costs incurred by alcatel of france  a major subcontractor to this project 
the non alcatel equipment provided by titan africa was financed through arrangement with the opt whereby titan africa would be paid in seven equal semi annual installments  which commenced on december  due to the approximate six to nine month delay in the delivery of the system  which was impacted by the expansion of the original project to include increased gsm lines  increased capacity and capability of the vsat sites and an overall increase in lines in benin  the africa merchant bank and titan africa have collectively agreed to extend the due date of the semi annual principal payments until such time as the service revenues have achieved certain levels  which is anticipated to occur in mid to late the terms of titan africa s agreement with the customer include  among other things  a revenue sharing of total net receipts earned on this project for up to a period of years depending upon when the equipment has been paid for 
as of december   approximately million was drawn on this facility  and has been used to reduce the related receivable balance due from the opt related to subcontract costs 
in october  we collected an million receivable from an african group related to the sale of a portion of our economic interest  net of all fixed equipment payments  in the revenue sharing of this project 
as of december   the outstanding receivable balance due on this contract was approximately million 
management believes that the appropriate insurance policies are in place to cover risk related to loss of equipment in certain foreign countries 
in relation to our investment in ivoire telecom  we provided equipment with an approximate aggregate value of million and we committed to provide up to a maximum of million for capital expenditures to build out the ivoire telecom network 
at december   this maximum commitment has been substantially funded  resulting in an investment balance of approximately million  which includes our initial equity investment of approximately million and equipment we provided 
our investment is reflected in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  in connection with our agreement to acquire an additional equity interest in sakon  an additional million of consideration was due and payable upon certain revenue targets being attained 
these targets were met in january  and a million installment was made in the second quarter of  a million installment was made in the first quarter of  and the remaining million is expected to be satisfied by issuance of titan common stock later in there are no titan guarantees of debt  either directly or indirectly  associated with ivoire telecom or sakon or any other unconsolidated subsidiaries other than approximately million of equipment financing 
as part of our strategy of seeking external financing to grow our commercial businesses  our discontinued surebeam subsidiary completed its initial public offering of its common stock on march  and raised gross proceeds of million 
we extended a credit facility for up to a maximum of million under which surebeam owed us approximately million as of december  on december   million of the note was exchanged for common stock of surebeam  at  the fifteen day trading average of surebeam stock as of december   which resulted in the exchange for  class b common shares of surebeam 
as of december   surebeam had approximately million in principal outstanding under the note 
on february   the remaining outstanding balance on the note of million was exchanged for equity of surebeam  at per share  the twenty day trading average of surebeam stock as of february   which resulted in the exchange for  class a and  class b common shares of surebeam 
on october   titan adopted a definitive plan to spin off surebeam in the form of a tax free dividend to titan stockholders within months from that date 
the plan involves filing a letter ruling request with the internal revenue service seeking approval of the tax free distribution 
titan has filed the letter ruling request  and intends to execute the spin off as soon as practical following the receipt of a favorable ruling and all required third party consents 
titan has purchased a world wide perpetual and exclusive  non royalty bearing license to use surebeam s intellectual property for all applications and fields other than the food  animal hide and flower markets for the following consideration a million senior secured line of credit  with customary financial  affirmative and negative covenants  the exchange of the million debt owed by surebeam to titan for additional shares of class b and class a common stock of surebeam  and a cash payment of million  with million paid at september  and four installments of million payable on each of march   june   september  and december  the company has obtained approval from its senior lenders to extend million of this credit facility  and expects to obtain the consent of its lenders for the remaining million prior to the spin off of surebeam 
in addition  titan and surebeam are negotiating other customary agreements in connection with the planned spin off of surebeam 
on july  we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering  which included an over allotment of  shares  at a price of per share 
we received approximate aggregate proceeds from the offering of million  net of underwriters commissions  in july transaction expenses related to the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and other investments 
in addition  certain titan stockholders sold  shares  including  shares from the exercise of options  from which we received proceeds of million 
funding for the advancement of our strategic goals  including acquisitions and continued investment in targeted commercial businesses and start up ventures and capital expenditures  is expected to continue 
we plan to finance these requirements from a combination of sources  which include cash generation from our core businesses  our credit facility and other available cash sources 
management believes that the combination of our existing cash  amounts available under our credit facility and cash flow expected to be generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund planned investments and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we could elect  or we could be required  to raise additional funds during that period and we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
additional capital may not be available at all  or may not be available on terms favorable to us 
any additional issuance of equity or equity linked securities may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
management is continually monitoring and reevaluating its level of investment in all of its operations  specifically the investment required in fiscal to further grow its commercial businesses  and the financing sources available to achieve our goals in each business area 
long term debt and other commitments our contractual cash obligations as of december   including principal maturities of long term debt and other commitments  were as follows  excluding contingent obligations and interest thereafter total in thousands long term debt senior credit facility     other    high tides   other commitments operating leases        capital leases  investment in e tenna   surebeam license agreement total contractual cash obligations       the high tides has a remarketing feature beginning approximately five years after the date of issuance  at which time we may elect to refinance or retire the high tides 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
these reserves are based on potential uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  historical losses  our customers credit worthiness  changes in government funding on certain of our contracts and adjustments that may arise from audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa of certain of our government contracts 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally will place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments and or services provided to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account in our commercial business would be principally dependent on a deterioration in economic and or political conditions in a particular country  such as benin  africa  in which our receivables due from the government controlled phone company of benin may be impacted 
our accounts receivable balances include unbilled receivables which are comprised of work in process which will be billed in accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules  as well as amounts billable upon final execution of contracts  contract completion  milestones or completion of rate negotiations 
payments to us for performance on certain of our us government contracts are subject to audit by the dcaa  and are subject to government funding 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from rate negotiations  audit adjustments  and or government funding availability 
to the extent that actual adjustments due to rate negotiations  audit adjustments  or government funding availability differ from our estimates  our provisions for doubtful accounts may be impacted 
due to a high degree of diversification in our government business  where any one contract accounts for no more than percent of titan systems annual revenues  the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account from this activity is not probable 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by the company 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries  particularly africa  in which we have investments 
benefit plans 
we provide for postretirement benefit obligations of operations discontinued in prior years for former employees and for certain current senior executive officers 
accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates  expected mortality rates and estimated growth rates in medical and healthcare costs  all assumptions our actuaries rely upon in preparing their estimates for us 
any materially different valuations for actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations could impact our accruals for these postretirement benefit obligations 
as the population that participates in these plans is limited  we do not believe changes in valuations would have a material impact on our provisions for these postretirement obligations 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
estimated losses from discontinued operations 
we provided for an accrual for the estimated loss on our discontinued surebeam business based upon management s estimates of the estimated operating losses to be incurred by surebeam from the date we adopted our plan to spin off surebeam on october   through october   as well as estimated spin off related costs 
to the extent that the actual operating losses incurred by surebeam differ from the estimates we used to calculate our estimated loss on disposal and to the extent that the estimated spin off costs differ from the actual costs we incur  the loss from discontinued operations may change 
revenue recognition 
we recognize a portion of our revenue using the percentage of completion method  which includes revenues recognized as units are delivered  in accordance with statement of position total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project based upon evaluation of the level of work achieved and costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenues recorded under such contracts could materially be affected and could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future periods 
in  approximately of titan systems revenues were generated by fixed price contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the remaining of titans systems revenues in were generated by cost plus fixed fee contracts and time and material contracts  for which percentage of completion is not used  and revenues are generally recognized as work is performed and billed to the customer 
accounting for business combinations 
since february of  we have acquired two companies acs and averstar  that have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
to qualify for the pooling of interests method  criteria relating to the attributes of the combining companies prior to the combination  the manner of combining the companies and the absence of certain planned transactions after the combination must be met 
under the pooling of interests method  the value of the assets and liabilities of the combined companies are carried forward at their recorded amounts and the reported income for all periods prior to the combination are combined and restated as if the combination had occurred at the beginning of the period presented 
if the criteria for pooling of interests accounting treatment are not met  then the purchase method of accounting would have been applied 
under the purchase method of accounting  all assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their fair values at the date of the acquisition and results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
accounting for these two acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting would have resulted in materially different reported results 
in relation to our allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and contingencies assumed in acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions  management makes estimates of such amounts as the fair value of assets and contingencies assumed 
to the extent that the actual values or contingencies may differ from the estimates used  our allocation of purchase price may differ  which may result in a change to the amount of goodwill and or purchased intangibles 
principles of consolidation 
management evaluates its investment in each joint venture and investment on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether consolidation or the cost or equity method is appropriate  based upon management s evaluation of the level of our ability to retain and exercise control through decision making ability and exercise significant influence  as well as our equity ownership interest 
in the event that our ability to obtain control and exercise significant influence changes materially from management s evaluation in determining whether consolidation should occur  or whether or not the cost or equity method is appropriate  then our operating results could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
risks relating to our business titan is committed to creating  building and launching technology based commercial businesses primarily from technologies developed for the government 
as part of implementing this strategy  titan has developed the three commercial businesses known as surebeam  titan wireless and cayenta  and is in the process of developing and commercializing the technology applications and businesses in titan s emerging technologies and businesses segment 
if the market for irradiation technology for non food applications fails to develop or titan wireless or cayenta fail to develop and grow as titan anticipates  or titan wireless s and or cayenta s principal products and services do not gain market acceptance  titan s revenues will be less than titan expects and titan may be unable to recoup the equity investments and intercompany advances titan has made to develop and grow those businesses 
to grow as currently contemplated  titan may need to derive an increasing portion of its revenues from its commercial businesses  including the businesses in titan s emerging technologies and businesses segment 
if the markets for some or all of the businesses in titan s emerging technologies and businesses segment fail to develop and grow as expected  or those markets do develop and grow as expected but those businesses principal products and services do not meet with market acceptance  titan s future prospects may suffer 
if any of titan s businesses fail to grow as titan anticipates  it may not be able to monetize these businesses and enable its stockholders to realize value from that process 
titan wireless titan wireless s principal strategy is to provide communications services and systems to developing countries primarily in asia  africa  the middle east  central asia and latin america 
titan wireless s future success will depend substantially on the rate and the extent to which the markets for communications services and systems develop in the developing countries that it targets 
titan cannot guarantee that substantial markets for communications services and systems in these developing countries will ever develop  or if those markets do develop  that titan wireless will be able to capture a significant portion of those markets 
the development of a market for communications services and systems in a particular developing country will depend upon a variety of factors including whether that country has sufficient resources to support such a market and whether the communications services and systems are offered at an affordable cost to their end users so that adequate traffic can be generated 
in certain countries  the competition to provide services may become increasingly competitive which could adversely affect revenue growth and margins 
cayenta cayenta s market is characterized by fluctuating demand for its products and services based on overall economic conditions and their impact on government and corporate information technology budgets as well as changes in user sentiment toward particular technologies  technology applications and related services 
cayenta s operating results for the year ended december  were adversely affected by a slowdown in corporate spending on commercial information technology services and e business software applications 
cayenta s market is also intensely competitive 
cayenta s competitors include numerous companies across various segments of the information technology services and software products markets 
existing or future competitors may independently develop and patent or copyright technologies that are superior or substantially similar to cayenta s technologies 
the costs to develop and to provide information technology services are relatively low 
moreover  barriers to entry  particularly in the areas of information technology consulting and integrating software applications  are low 
therefore  cayenta will likely continue to face additional competition from new entrants into its market 
if overall economic conditions continue to weaken demand for cayenta s products and services  or if cayenta is unable to anticipate and respond effectively to changing market conditions or to compete effectively for any reason  its business will suffer 
emerging technologies and businesses the businesses in titan s emerging technologies and businesses segment face the ongoing challenges of developing technology applications that anticipate and satisfy customer requirements and achieving market acceptance for those technology applications in new and rapidly changing markets 
to the extent these businesses fail to effectively meet either of those challenges  titan s ability to execute its monetizing strategy and provide increased value to titan s stockholders will be diminished 
titan has a limited history of commercializing new technologies and titan s commercial businesses may not remain or ever become successful 
in  titan adopted a strategy of seeking to develop commercial businesses using technology developed for government purposes in titan s government defense business 
surebeam and the titan wireless business are a product of this strategy 
for the most part  titan s commercial businesses are in a relatively early stage of development 
these technology based businesses are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in companies at these early stages of development  including the risks that their base technology will become obsolete and that they will fail to respond in a timely and cost effective manner to rapid technological changes  the risks associated with operating in markets that are subject to a high degree of competition  the risk that they will have inadequate management resources to capitalize on market opportunities and execute their strategy  the risk that they will be unable to manage rapid growth effectively  the risk that they will be unable to execute successfully each portion of their business strategy on schedule  the risk that titan may not identify markets with sufficient opportunities to justify titan s investments in products and solutions for these markets  the market and operating risks that are unique to each particular business  and the risk that adequate capital may not be available to fund their continued development 
titan balances its investment objectives for each of its businesses with titan s overall profitability objectives 
this balancing is a basic part of titan s approach to creating and building new commercial businesses and creates the possibility that any or all of titan s businesses may not grow at the pace or to the level that they otherwise might if they were independent companies 
these factors  including the risks identified above  could affect titan s ability to monetize its investments in its businesses or diminish the value that titan s stockholders ultimately recognize from those investments 
titan may make equity investments or intercompany advances which titan could lose or have to write off 
titan has historically funded businesses in its emerging technologies and businesses segment  as well as its other other commercial businesses  with equity investments and or intercompany advances  and expects to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  we also make investments in businesses that are not controlled by titan to further our strategic objectives 
for example  titan has advanced million to cayenta and has invested approximately million in ivoire telecom and approximately million in e tenna as of december  at the time titan makes these investments or advances  these businesses are typically at an early stage of development 
if these businesses do not become profitable or titan is unable to monetize its investments in them  titan could lose all or a portion of its equity in those businesses and be required to write off some or all of any amounts advanced 
titan previously funded its publicly traded subsidiary  surebeam  through a million subordinated promissory note of which titan exchanged million on february  for equity of surebeam at an average price of per share and million on december  at an average price of per share 
titan has agreed to extend a new million senior secured revolving line of credit to surebeam 
titan is required to obtain the consent of its lenders under its credit facility in order to extend the credit facility to surebeam 
if titan does lend money to surebeam  and if surebeam does not become profitable  titan may be required to write off some or all of any amounts advanced 
titan may not be able to effect the tax free spin off of its ownership interest in surebeam in accordance with its announced plan 
titan has filed a request for a letter ruling from the internal revenue service to enable titan to distribute its remaining ownership interest in surebeam to titan s stockholders on a tax free basis as soon as practical following receipt of a favorable letter ruling 
titan also is seeking consent from its lenders under its credit facility in order to effect the spin off of surebeam and titan cannot be certain that its lenders will authorize this spin off under these circumstances 
titan may not obtain a favorable letter ruling from the internal revenue service 
further  titan is not obligated to make such a distribution 
however  titan s board of directors has adopted a plan to spin off surebeam and  as a result  titan has discontinued surebeam for financial reporting purposes 
titan s commercial businesses growth may be impaired because of investment or funding choices titan makes or because titan is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or to access capital from external sources 
titan typically funds its businesses growth with equity investments  intercompany advances and or public or private financing 
titan may choose not to fund potential growth opportunities for its businesses with equity investments or intercompany advances based on risk considerations or titan s balancing of its investment objectives for those businesses with its overall profitability objectives 
in addition  titan may be unable to fund potential growth opportunities for its businesses to the extent that titan systems does not generate sufficient cash flow for titan to do so or titan does not otherwise have capital on hand and or cannot access adequate capital 
titan may also be precluded from funding potential growth opportunities for its commercial businesses with public or private financing based on market conditions 
to the extent that titan is unable to  or chooses not to  provide capital to its commercial businesses to fund potential growth opportunities  titan s commercial businesses growth could be impaired 
market conditions and legal and contractual restrictions may impair titan s ability to monetize its investments in its commercial technology applications and businesses 
titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to monetize any of its investments in its commercial technology applications or businesses  whether through an initial public offering of a subsidiary  a complete spin off to titan s stockholders  an outright sale of a subsidiary  or a technology license or sale 
market or competitive conditions may be such that titan is unable to complete initial public offerings of its subsidiaries or spin offs of its subsidiaries to titan s stockholders at valuations that titan considers appropriate  in which case titan may choose to delay or forego initial public offerings or spin offs of these subsidiaries 
based on market or competitive conditions  titan may also be unable to sell or license its commercial technology applications or sell its businesses at valuations or for other consideration titan considers appropriate  in which case titan may choose to delay or forego those sales or licenses 
to the extent possible  titan intends to structure any initial public offerings that its subsidiaries conduct in a manner to preserve the ability to later distribute the stock titan retains in the subsidiaries to its stockholders on a tax free basis 
under current law  there are a number of tax and other legal requirements that must be satisfied in order to successfully execute this strategy and titan cannot guarantee that they will be met 
contractual restrictions may also restrict titan s ability to successfully execute this strategy 
with the exception of cayenta  titan s credit facility does not permit its subsidiaries to conduct initial public offerings or  with the exception of cayenta  allow titan to distribute the stock of its subsidiaries to titan stockholders without the consent of the lenders 
titan may distribute the stock of cayenta to titan stockholders without the consent of the lenders so long as titan is in compliance with financial ratios specified in  and not otherwise in default under  its credit facility 
titan depends on government contracts for a substantial majority of its revenues and the loss of government contracts or a decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could adversely affect titan s revenues and cash flows and titan s ability to fund its commercial businesses 
titan s revenues from us government business represented approximately of titan s total revenues in  and approximately of titan s total revenues in titan s us government contracts are only funded on an annual basis  and the us government may cancel these contracts at any time without penalty or may change its requirements  programs or contract budget or decline to exercise option periods  any of which could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows from us government contracts 
titan s revenues and cash flow from us government contracts could also be reduced by declines in us defense and other federal agency budgets 
a significant percentage of titan s products and services are predominantly sold and performed under contracts with various parts of the us navy or us air force or with prime contractors to the us navy or us air force 
although these various parts of the us navy or us air force are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors  titan s various us navy and us air force customers exercise independent purchasing decisions 
however  because of such concentration of titan s contracts  titan is vulnerable to adverse changes in its revenues and cash flows if a significant number of titan s us navy or us air force contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons 
in addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets  titan may be adversely affected by budgetary constraints affecting us government spending generally  and changes in fiscal policy  curtailment of the u 
s government s use of technology services and products providers  the adoption of new laws or regulations  technological developments  us government shutdowns  such as that which occurred during the us government s fiscal year  and general economic conditions 
these or other factors could cause us defense and other federal agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts or not to exercise options to renew contracts 
any of these actions or any of the other actions described above could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows and impair titan s ability to make equity investments in or intercompany advances to titan s commercial subsidiaries as part of titan s approach to creating and building new businesses 
government audits of titan s government contracts could result in a material charge to titan s earnings and have a negative effect on titan s cash position 
titan s government contracts are subject to cost audits by the government 
these audits may occur several years after completion of the audited work 
titan could have a material charge to its earnings or reduction in its cash position as a result of an audit  including an audit of one of the companies titan has acquired 
some of titan s acquired companies did not historically impose internal controls as rigorous as those titan imposes on the government contracts titan performs  which may increase the likelihood that an audit of their government contracts could cause a charge to titan s earnings or reduction in titan s cash position 
titan s operating margins may decline under its fixed price contracts if titan fails to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy titan s obligations 
some of titan s contracts are fixed price contracts under which titan bears the risk of any cost overruns 
titan s profits are adversely affected if its costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions titan used in bidding for the contract 
in and  approximately of titan s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts of which of titan systems revenues are derived from fixed price contracts with the remaining related to our commercial businesses 
often  titan is required to fix the price for a contract before titan finalizes the project specifications  which increases the risk that titan will misprice these contracts 
the complexity of many of titan s engagements makes accurately estimating titan s time and resources more difficult 
if titan is not able to retain its contracts with the us government and subcontracts under us government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process  titan s revenues may suffer 
upon expiration of a us government contract or subcontract under a us government prime contract  if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
titan cannot guarantee that titan  or if we are a subcontractor that the prime contractor  will win any particular bid  or that titan will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
further  all us government contracts are subject to protest by competitors 
the termination of several of titan s significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of titan s significant contracts  the imposition of fines or damages  or titan s suspension or debarment from bidding on additional contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
titan may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations  and changes in government regulations could adversely affect titan s business 
titan s defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations 
among the most significant regulations are the following the us federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  the us truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  the us cost accounting standards  which impose accounting requirements that govern titan s right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contracts  laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data  and laws and regulatory requirements relating to satellite communications and other wireless communication systems in the developing countries where titan wireless operates 
these regulations affect how titan s customers and titan do business and  in some instances  impose added costs on titan s businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
with respect to us government contracts  any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
titan s failure to identify  attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect its existing businesses and its ability to build additional commercial businesses 
titan cannot guarantee that titan will be able to attract and retain the highly qualified technical personnel for each of its segments  including engineers  computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for classified work  that are necessary for maintaining and growing titan s existing businesses or building additional commercial businesses 
titan s success also depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of titan s management personnel for each of its segments 
titan s ability to build additional commercial businesses in its emerging technologies and businesses segment will depend in part on titan s ability to attract management personnel from outside titan with relevant market expertise and management skills  and on titan s ability to retain and motivate these managers 
titan competes in highly competitive markets against many companies that are larger  better financed and better known than titan 
if titan is unable to compete effectively  titan s business and prospects will be adversely affected 
titan s businesses operate in highly competitive markets 
many of its competitors are larger  better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than titan can 
titan s commercial businesses compete against other technologies as well as against companies with similar products and services 
in order to remain competitive  titan must invest to keep its products technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to titan s customers 
titan s ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on titan s capital resources and titan s ability to invest in maintaining and expanding its market share 
titan has completed numerous strategic acquisitions and may complete others  which could increase titan s costs or liabilities or be disruptive 
since january   titan has acquired government information technology businesses  including the recently completed acquisition of jaycor  inc  and has entered into a merger agreement to acquire science and engineering associates as part of titan s strategy of consolidating government information technology businesses 
in addition  since january   titan has acquired five information technology services and solutions companies as part of cayenta s development of its total services provider offering  and titan has made investments in a wireless telecommunications company  ivoire telecom  and acquired an international voice  data  and internet services provider  and just complete the acquisition globalnet  as part of titan wireless s business 
several of the businesses that titan acquired had themselves acquired other businesses prior to their acquisition by titan 
titan may not be able to complete its proposed acquisition of science and engineering associates or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
the acquisition and integration of new businesses involves risk 
the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of titan s common stock for the following reasons  among others titan may need to divert more management resources to integration than titan planned  which may adversely affect titan s ability to pursue other more profitable activities  the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  titan may not eliminate as many redundant costs as titan anticipated in selecting its acquisition candidates  and one or more of titan s acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that titan failed to discover through its diligence prior to the acquisition 
titan intends to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions 
instability in the us securities markets and volatility in titan s common stock price may make acquisitions with titan s common stock more expensive 
titan may incur significant costs in protecting titan s intellectual property which could adversely affect titan s profit margins 
titan s inability to protect its patents and proprietary rights in the us and foreign countries could adversely affect titan s businesses prospects and competitive positions 
as part of titan s strategy  titan seeks to protect its proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary right protection in the us and other countries 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if titan is unable to obtain or maintain these protections  titan may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights 
in addition  titan may incur significant expense both in protecting its intellectual property and in defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others 
titan assesses the strength of its patent and intellectual property protection for its technologies and products 
despite titan s assessments and titan s belief in the strength of its patent protection for particular technologies or products  titan s patents may not provide effective barriers to entry against competitors in the markets targeted by particular technologies and products because titan s competitors may develop competing technologies and products that do not infringe upon titan s patents 
titan also could choose to modify or abandon one or more planned or current products because of these assessments or actual or threatened claims by other companies 
titan is not certain that its pending patent applications will be issued 
titan also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
titan has taken measures to protect its trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality agreements with titan s employees  consultants and advisors 
it is possible that these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not be sufficient to compensate titan for damages incurred 
titan generally controls and limits access to  and the distribution of  its product documentation and other proprietary information 
titan also cannot guarantee that other parties will not independently develop titan s know how or otherwise obtain access to titan s technology 
risks of titan s international operations  including economic conditions in other countries  could adversely affect the prospects of its titan wireless  surebeam and cayenta businesses 
titan s cayenta  surebeam and titan wireless businesses each operate in international markets 
through titan s subsidiary  titan wireless  titan sells communications services and systems primarily in developing countries 
although titan currently sells its communications services and systems primarily in us dollars  currency devaluations and adverse market conditions in developing countries in the past have and in the future could negatively affect demand for titan s communications services and systems and  consequently  titan s revenues for this segment 
in addition  titan may in the future bill for its communications services in local currency 
as a result  revenues in this segment may be adversely affected by economic conditions in developing countries 
titan s businesses that operate in international markets also face the possibility of becoming subject to added costs as part of maintaining compliance with varied foreign regulatory requirements 
titan does not believe that the international operations of its existing businesses currently subject it to material risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
however  as titan increases the international operations of its businesses  titan s risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  to the extent titan bills for its products in foreign currencies  will increase 
selling products or services in international markets also entails other market  economic  cultural  legal and political risks  conditions and expenses 
these risks include trade protective measures and import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by foreign governments  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  political and economic instability  difficulties in collecting amounts owed to titan  difficulties in managing overseas employees and contractors  and changes in applicable laws and regulations  including licensing laws  tax laws and regulations 
any one of these factors or other international business risks could adversely affect titan s financial performance 
the covenants in titan s credit facility restrict titan s financial and operational flexibility and titan s failure to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  titan s ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments  including investments in titan s subsidiaries  or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  merge or consolidate  or make acquisitions 
an event of default under titan s credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
titan has pledged substantially all of its consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries to secure the debt under titan s credit facility  excluding titan s foreign subsidiaries 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against those consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s credit facility also requires titan to maintain specified financial ratios 
titan s ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond titan s control  and titan cannot assure you that titan will meet those ratios 
titan also may incur future debt obligations that might subject titan to restrictive covenants that could affect titan s financial and operational flexibility or subject titan to other events of default 
any such restrictive covenants in any future debt obligations titan incurs could limit titan s ability to fund its commercial businesses with equity investments or intercompany advances  which would impede titan s ability to execute its approach to creating and building new businesses 
titan s operating results may be adversely affected by disruptions in its supply of products and components or services 
because titan s internal manufacturing capacity is limited  titan uses contract manufacturers 
while titan uses care in selecting its manufacturers  this arrangement gives titan less control over the reliability of supply  quality and price of products or components than if titan manufactured them itself 
in some cases  titan obtains products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  titan relies upon surebeam as an exclusive supplier of linear accelerators and surebeam  in turn  relies on one supplier for some of the key components used to manufacture surebeam s linear accelerators 
consequently  titan risks disruptions in its supply of key products and components if titan s suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes  natural disasters  financial condition or other factors 
any material supply disruptions could adversely affect titan s business  financial condition and results of operations as well as titan s ongoing product cost structure 
titan s business is subject to significant environmental regulation 
compliance costs  or any future violations or liability under environmental laws  could harm titan s business 
titan is subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances 
titan cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances or wastes  and  in the event of such an incident  titan could be held liable for any damages that result 
from time to time  titan has been notified of violations of government and environmental regulations 
titan attempts to correct these violations promptly without any material impact on titan s operations 
in addition  titan may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
titan s revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of sales and contracts awards due to the long procurement process for most of its products and services  defense and intelligence budgets  the time it takes for the new markets titan targets to develop and for titan to develop and provide products and services for those markets  competition and general economic conditions 
titan s product mix and unit volume  its ability to keep expenses within budgets  its distribution channels and its pricing affect its gross margins 
these factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely affect titan s results of operations within a period and cause titan s financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
consequently  titan does not believe that comparison of its results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of its likely future results of operations 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters titan s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if so  the market price of titan s common stock may decline significantly
