item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in the form k 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
general our electrical contracting business is operated in two segments commercial and industrial and residential 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these reportable segments 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  the assessment of goodwill impairment  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the recording of our self insurance liabilities 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in the note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
we frequently negotiate the final terms and prices of those contracts with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we are generally able to achieve higher margins on fixed price and unit price than on cost plus contracts 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  more than half of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited in aggregate by the high volume and relatively short duration of the fixed price contracts we undertake 
additionally  we derive a significant amount of our revenues from new construction and from the southern part of the united states 
downturns in new construction activity or in construction in the southern united states could affect our results 
we complete most projects within one year  while we frequently provide service and maintenance work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we recognize revenue on service and time and material work when services are performed 
work performed under a construction contract generally provides that the customers accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered measured in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion for construction contracts is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
we generally consider contracts to be substantially complete upon departure from the work site and acceptance by the customer 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated contract costs and profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and the effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
included in this evaluation are certain assumptions and estimates to determine the fair values of reporting units such as estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  as well as assumptions and estimates related to the valuation of other identified intangible assets 
changes in these assumptions and estimates or significant changes to the market value of our common stock could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for unknown collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  our customers access to capital  our customers willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationships with our customers 
we are self insured for workers compensation  auto liability  general liability and employee related health care claims  subject to large deductibles 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are derived from known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
therefore  if actual experience differs from than the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation  adjustments to the reserve may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
results of operations the following table presents selected historical results of operations of ies and subsidiaries with dollar amounts in thousands 
these historical statements of operations include the results of operations for businesses acquired through purchases beginning on their respective dates of acquisition 
year ended september  in thousands revenues    cost of services including depreciation    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    restructuring charges  goodwill amortization   income from operations    interest and other expense  net    income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    provision for income taxes    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  net income loss    revenues year ended september  percentage percent of total growth revenues decline commercial and industrial residential total company revenues decreased million  or  from  million for the year ended september  to  million for the year ended september  the decrease in commercial and industrial revenues was primarily the result of non recurring work performed for one customer during the year ended september   a decrease in revenues from communications work and a decrease of non residential revenues in the midwest  as well as increased competition across the country for available work during the year ended september  revenues increased million  or  from  million for the year ended september  to  million for the year ended september  the revenue growth within the operating segments and the change in proportion in revenues among the segments were the result of increased construction and communications activity in the markets we serve 
gross margin segment gross margins as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  commercial and industrial residential total company gross profit decreased million  or from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  overall gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the overall decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of increased competition for available work  project fade recorded on fixed price contracts at some of our subsidiaries during the year ended september   lower margins on work in the communications market and charges associated with increasing our estimated self insurance liabilities 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained constant for the years ended september  and margins remained flat as a result of increased bidders on certain fixed price commercial and industrial and communications projects and the impact such bidders had on margins in these segments  and were further impacted by project delays  project cancellations and decreased productivity following the terrorist attacks of september  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue remained the same at for and the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the termination of certain administrative field and home office personnel during the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily results from the occurrence of certain costs incurred in the year ended september  which were not incurred in the year ended september  including the write off  net of recoveries of million of costs associated with our decision to curtail the development of an information system and the non cash compensation charge of million associated with the restricted stock awards  offset by increased infrastructure costs in restructuring charges in october we began implementation of a workforce reduction program 
the purpose of this program was to cut costs by reducing the number of administrative staff both in the field and at the home office 
the total number of terminated employees was approximately as a result of the program implementation  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with employees during the year ended september  the charges were based on the costs of the workforce reduction program and include severance and other special termination benefits 
at september   approximately million of these charges have not been paid and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of revenues  income from operations decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this decrease in income from operations was primarily attributed to decreased revenues year over year  decreased margins earned on those revenues and restructuring charges of million incurred during the year ended september   partially offset by the non recurring goodwill amortization of million incurred during the year ended september  in accordance with the current accounting standard 
income from operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily the result of lower selling  general and administrative costs discussed above and gross profit earned on the slightly higher revenues during the year ended september  as a percentage of revenues  income from operations increased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a million gain resulting from the retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due february  in the last quarter of the year ended september   a million net gain resulting from the sale of certain subsidiaries and offset by a million loss recorded on our investment in energy photovoltaics  inc and losses on sales of assets of million 
these amounts were offset by increased interest expenses associated with increased average borrowings during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  interest and other expense  net increased from net expense of million in to million in  primarily as a result of increased interest expense resulting from the issuance of million senior subordinated notes due february  in may provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the effective tax rate for the year ended september  included a provision for non deductible goodwill amortization expense while the effective tax rate for the year ended september  includes the effect of the projected utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization representing a smaller percentage of our income before income taxes in liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  no borrowings under our credit facility  million of letters of credit outstanding and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of million 
during the year ended september   we generated million of net cash from operating activities 
this net cash from operating activities was comprised of net loss of million  increased by million of non cash charges and increased by million in working capital changes 
non cash charges included cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  depreciation and amortization expense  restricted stock compensation charges  provision for allowance for doubtful accounts  changes in deferred income taxes and losses on sales of property and equipment 
working capital changes consisted of a million decrease in receivables as a result of the timing of collections offset by a million decrease in payables 
working capital changes were further increased by a million decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  a million increase in other noncurrent liabilities and offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  with the balance of the change due to other working capital changes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for capital expenditures and million provided from divestitures and other 
net cash used by financing activities was million  resulting primarily from the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and the repayments of amounts outstanding on our credit facility at september  on may   we replaced our million credit facility with a new million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lending institutions to be used for working capital  capital expenditure  acquisitions and other corporate purposes that matures may  amounts borrowed under our credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to either a the london interbank offered rate libor plus percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in our credit facility or b the higher of i the bank s prime rate or ii the federal funds rate plus percent plus an additional percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
commitment fees of percent are assessed on any unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
our existing and future subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under our facility  and our facility is secured by the capital stock of those subsidiaries  our accounts receivable and the accounts receivable of those subsidiaries 
borrowings under our credit facility are limited to of outstanding receivables as defined in the agreement 
our credit facility requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  restricts our ability to repurchase shares of common stock  to incur other indebtedness and requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including certain financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the financial covenants include minimum net worth requirements  a maximum total consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio  a maximum senior consolidated debt to ebitda ratio  and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
at november   we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility 
on january  and may   we completed our offerings of million and million senior subordinated notes  respectively 
the offering completed on may  yielded million in proceeds  net of a million discount and million in offering costs 
the proceeds from the may  offering were used primarily to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the notes bear interest at and will mature on february  we pay interest on the notes on february and august of each year 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our subsidiaries 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and restrictions on liens  guarantees and dividends 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended september   we retired approximately million of these senior subordinated notes 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a gain of million 
this gain is recorded in interest and other expense  net in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which we adopted july  in august we entered into an interest rate swap contract that has a notional amount of million and was established to manage the interest rate risk of the senior subordinated note obligations 
at september  the fair value of this derivative was million and was included in other noncurrent assets 
we terminated this contract in february we received cash equal to the fair value of this derivative of million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the bonds 
in february we entered into a new interest rate swap contract that has a notional amount of million and was established to manage the interest rate risk of the senior subordinated note obligations 
we terminated this contract in august we received cash equal to the fair value of this derivative of million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the bonds 
at september  we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
effective october   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 all goodwill amortization ceased effective october  goodwill amortization for the year ended september  would have otherwise been million before the impairment charge 
goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for each of the reportable units 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  we expect to perform our impairment tests annually during the first fiscal quarter 
based on our impairment tests performed upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized a charge of million per share in the first quarter of to reduce the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting units to its implied fair value 
this impairment is a result of adopting a fair value approach  under sfas no 
 to testing impairment of goodwill as compared to the previous method utilized in which evaluations of goodwill impairment were made using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the assets carrying amount 
under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations for the year ended september  impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  generally are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
all of our operating income and cash flows are generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries  which are the subsidiary guarantors of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the separate financial statements of the subsidiary guarantors are not included herein because i the subsidiary guarantors are all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  ii the subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed the senior subordinated notes  iii the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings  and equity of the subsidiary guarantors is substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the company on a consolidated basis  and iv the presentation of separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the subsidiary guarantors is not deemed material 
other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements that expose us to increased risk 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to retain our cash when we do not own the vehicles or equipment and we pay a monthly lease rental fee 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may determine to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically we are liable to the lessor for various lease cancellation or termination costs and the difference between the then fair market value of the leased asset and the implied book value of the leased asset as calculated in accordance with the lease agreement 
some of our customers require us to post letters of credit as a means of guaranteeing performance under our contracts and ensuring payment by us to subcontractors and vendors 
if our customer has reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit  we would be required to reimburse our creditor for the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a reimbursement to our creditor  we may have a charge to earnings in that period 
to date we have not had a situation where a customer has had reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit 
many of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety 
those bonds guarantee the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
in the event that we fail to perform under a contract or pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety to pay or perform under our bond 
our relationship with our surety is such that we will indemnify the surety for any expenses it incurs in connection with any of the bonds it issues on our behalf 
to date  we have not incurred significant expenses to indemnify our surety for expenses it incurred on our behalf 
we have committed to invest up to million in enertech capital partners ii  lp enertech 
enertech is a private equity firm specializing in investment opportunities emerging from deregulation and resulting convergence of the energy  utility and telecommunications industries 
through september   we had invested million under our commitment to enertech 
our future contractual obligations include in thousands thereafter total debt and capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations        our other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit    other commercial commitments   balance of investment commitment in enertech 
outlook economic conditions across the country are challenging 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables and reducing days sales outstanding 
to improve our position for continued success  we continue to take steps to reduce costs 
we have made significant cuts in administrative overhead at the home office and in the field 
although we have seen signs of improvement in our quarter ended september   the economic outlook for fiscal is still somewhat uncertain 
we expect earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal to range between and per share 
for the year ended september   we expect earnings to range between and per share excluding any potential goodwill impairment charges 
we expect to generate cash flow from operations 
our cash flows from operations tend to track with the seasonality of our business and historically have improved in the latter part of our fiscal year 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next twelve months 
our ability to generate cash flow from operations is dependent on many factors  including demand for our products and services  the availability of work at margins acceptable to us and the ultimate collectibility of our receivables 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
seasonality and cyclical fluctuations our results of operations from residential construction are seasonal  depending on weather trends  with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter 
the commercial and industrial aspect of our business is less subject to seasonal trends  as this work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather 
our service and maintenance business is generally not affected by seasonality 
in addition  the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical 
our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects  acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period 
inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results in those fiscal years  or on any of the acquired businesses during similar periods 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and  was effective for ies on october  these statements require that all derivative instruments such as an interest rate swap contract  be recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the criteria for cash flow and fair value hedges require that hedging relationships must be designated and documented upon inception 
the documentation must include the consideration of the hedged item  the specific risk being hedged  identification of the hedging instrument  the company s risk management strategy  and how effectiveness will be assessed 
the effectiveness assessment must have a historical basis that supports the assertion that the hedge will be effective prospectively 
at the date of adoption  there was no financial impact on our consolidated financial statements as we were not a party to any derivative instruments 
in august and february  we entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage specific interest rate risks 
these interest rate swap contracts were terminated prior to september  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for accounting and reporting requirements for business combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also requires that acquired intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they meet one of two specified criteria 
additionally  the statement adds certain disclosure requirements to those required by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  including disclosure of the primary reasons for the business combination and the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption 
this statement is required to be applied to all business combinations initiated after june  and to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july  or later 
use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 which must be applied to fiscal years beginning after december   modifies the accounting and reporting of goodwill and intangible assets 
the pronouncement requires entities to discontinue the amortization of goodwill  reallocate all existing goodwill among its reporting segments based on criteria set by sfas no 
and perform initial impairment tests by applying a fair value based analysis on the goodwill in each reporting segment 
any impairment at the initial adoption date shall be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to the initial adoption  goodwill shall be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
under sfas no 
 entities are required to determine the useful life of other intangible assets and amortize the value over the useful life 
if the useful life is determined to be indefinite  no amortization will be recorded 
for intangible assets recognized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the useful life should be reassessed 
other intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment in a manner similar to goodwill 
at september   our net goodwill was approximately million  and annual amortization of such goodwill was approximately million 
we adopted sfas no 
in our first fiscal quarter of the impairment charge upon adoption was million  and was equal to a substantial amount of our recorded goodwill 
this adoption did not impact our free cash flows  our operating income or compliance with our debt instruments 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 
additionally  companies must reclassify in all prior periods presented those items that do not meet the criteria under the statement 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial statements issued on or after may  we adopted sfas no 
on july  during july and august  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due february  in connection with this sale  we fully amortized million of offering costs and million in unamortized bond discounts and recognized a million gain on extinguishment of debt 
the gain is recorded in interest and other expense  net as other income 
subsequent event on october   we sold one of our subsidiaries for approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any significant market risks from commodity price risk or foreign currency exchange risk 
our exposure to significant market risks include outstanding borrowings under our floating rate credit facility 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
as a result  our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates
