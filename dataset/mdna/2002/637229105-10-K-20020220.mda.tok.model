liquidity and capital resources the company s primary uses of capital resources include capital expenditures  working capital and acquisitions 
future business acquisitions may be funded through current liquidity  borrowed funds  and or issuances of common stock 
the company s capital expenditures include amounts for computers  external and internally developed software  as well as improvements to operating facilities 
during  the company s capital expenditures totaled million 
such expenditures were financed from operating cash flow  which for totaled million 
capital expenditures and operating cash flow for were million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow increased in compared to due to improved profits and the timing of tax payments between the company and national city  offset by higher accounts receivable 
table of contents balances at year end 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be comparable to which will be principally used to enhance merchant card processing capabilities 
on january   the company acquired the merchant services business units from several national city banking subsidiaries for million in cash 
on june   the company acquired a ownership interest in aams for million in cash 
on august   the company completed the sale of the bpo unit to affiliated computer services  inc for million cash million after transaction related expenses 
as the company does not carry significant amounts of inventory and historically has experienced short collection periods for its accounts receivable  it does not require substantial working capital to support revenue growth 
working capital requirements will vary depending upon future acquisition activity 
increases in working capital needs are expected to be financed through operating cash flow and current cash balances 
effects of september terrorist attacks the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september   led to reduced levels of air travel 
the company currently processes credit card transactions for six of the top ten united states airlines  and the majority of its payment services business is also tied to the travel industry 
travel related customers  principally airlines  represented approximately of revenue from continuing businesses for the year ended december   from merchant card services and from payment services 
to the extent future air travel continues at levels below historical trends  that portion of merchant card services and payment services revenue will be impacted 
there is less revenue exposure in the payment services business due to the cost plus contract with the airlines reporting corporation and contractual minimums with other travel related customers 
the unprecedented slowdown in air travel  combined with the costs of additional security measures  has raised questions about the ongoing financial viability of the airline industry 
in the event of bankruptcy liquidation of one or more of the company s airline customers  the company could become financially responsible for refunding tickets purchased through visa or mastercard under the chargeback rules of those associations 
see commitments and contingencies  note l to consolidated financial statements 
in the near term  management believes that airline bankruptcy liquidations are highly unlikely given the recent federal financial support for the airline industry 
in november  congress passed the aviation and transportation security act which requires airlines to honor tickets for other airlines that may suspend  interrupt or discontinue service due to insolvency or bankruptcy 
considering the foregoing and in light of other actions taken to mitigate the situation  management believes the likelihood of any material loss under the chargeback rules is remote 
recent accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and certain other intangible assets  which do not possess finite useful lives  will no longer be amortized over the estimated life but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment based on specific guidance provided in the new standard 
intangible assets determined to have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and also continue to be subject to impairment testing 
the provisions of sfas were adopted by the company as required effective january  application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to reduce amortization expense by approximately million pre tax  resulting in an increase in net income of approximately million  or 
table of contents per diluted share  in as compared to sfas  as part of its adoption provisions  requires a transitional impairment test to be applied to all goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to june  and any resulting impairment loss be reported as a change in accounting principle 
management does not expect an impairment loss to be recorded in as a result of adoption 
the company currently does not have any other indefinite lived intangible assets on its balance sheet 
it is also anticipated there will not be any material categorical reclassifications or adjustments to the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets as a result of adopting the new guidance 
in general  application of the new provisions may result in more income statement volatility due to the potential periodic recognition of impairment losses  which are likely to vary in amount and regularity  for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  versus reducing those assets through the recognition of recurring  consistent amortization amounts 
accounting for long lived assets sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  was issued in october and addresses how and when to measure impairment on long lived assets and how to account for long lived assets that an entity plans to dispose of either through sale  abandonment  exchange  or distribution to owners 
the new provisions supersede sfas  which addressed asset impairment  and certain provisions of apb opinion related to reporting the effects of the disposal of a business segment and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than the measurement date 
under sfas  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement 
the provisions of sfas became effective for the company january  and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended december   ncbk also held an average of approximately million of customer funds  on which the company earns interest 
because of the short term nature of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not impact the fair value of these instruments 
the company s earnings  however  are impacted by changes in interest rates  affecting both interest earnings on the company s cash equivalents and interest earnings on customer funds maintained by ncbk 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax earnings 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual pre tax earnings
