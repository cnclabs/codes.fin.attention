item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  and financial condition for the fiscal years ended june  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing quad city bank trust 
quad city bank trust opened in january with million in assets  and the company has grown to million in consolidated assets as of june  management expects continued opportunities for growth  even though the rate of growth will probably be slower than that experienced to date 
the company reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million and basic earnings per share for fiscal and million and basic earnings per share for fiscal the increase in fiscal earnings from fiscal was attributable primarily to significant increases in both net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense 
the decrease in fiscal earnings from fiscal was attributable to an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by increases in both noninterest income and net interest income 
when compared to fiscal  fiscal reflected significant growth in both net interest income and noninterest income for the company 
for fiscal  net interest and noninterest income improved by and  respectively  for a combined increase of million when compared to fiscal quad city bank trust generated much of the improvement in net interest margin  as well as a large increase in the gains on sales of residential real estate loans during the year 
offsetting these revenue improvements for the company were increases in noninterest expense of million and the provision for loan losses of million 
during fiscal  pre tax costs associated with the company s operation of the cedar rapids bank trust subsidiary were approximately million  and were the primary contributors to the climb in noninterest expense 
while the after tax start up losses at cedar rapids bank trust  including the pre charter losses  were million for fiscal  these losses were less than anticipated  and cedar rapids bank and trust s growth was more rapid than expected 
management remains confident that the decision to enter the cedar rapids market will provide significant long term benefits to the company 
also impacting noninterest expense for fiscal were legal costs at bancard  related to its arbitration proceedings to collect a large customer receivable and the subsequent settlement of the dispute in february as a result of the settlement  an amount was paid by the customer to bancard  which resulted in the collection of the receivable  less an amount that approximated the costs of continued arbitration 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal with the same comparison  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased  which resulted in a increase in the net interest spread of at june  to at june  the broadening of the net interest spread created a increase in the net interest margin 
for fiscal  net interest margin was compared to for fiscal management continues to closely monitor and manage net interest margin 
the primary challenge for the subsidiary banks currently  from a profitability standpoint  is to continue these improvements in its net interest margin 
very competitive loan rate environments have resulted in the subsidiary banks interest margin being below their national peer group 
management continues to address this issue with alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
the company s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of the company include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
the company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the company has added facilities and employees to accommodate both its historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as cedar rapids bank trust moved to its permanent facility in the fall of  and both banks continue to add the facilities and resources necessary to attract and serve additional customers during  quad city bank trust began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this function to bancard  a separate subsidiary of the company 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to customers of a single independent sales organization or iso 
this iso was sold in  and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of thousand for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed  and a lower transaction fee for new merchants  in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of thousand being recognized during fiscal bancard terminated its processing for this iso in may  eliminating approximately of its average monthly processing volume 
prior to this iso s termination  bancard s average monthly processing volume for fiscal was million 
during both fiscal and  bancard worked to establish additional iso relationships and further develop the relationships with existing isos successfully rebuilding and expanding processing volumes 
bancard s average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed during fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed by bancard increased to million 
monthly processing volumes at bancard during fiscal climbed to a level above that existing prior to the termination of all processing with the initial iso 
during fiscal  quad city bank trust expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter 
cedar rapids bank trust currently has one mortgage loan originator 
quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust originate mortgage loans on personal residences and sell the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the subsidiary banks realize revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gains on the sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during fiscal  the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million of these loans  which resulted in gains of million 
the decrease in interest rates during that time caused a significant increase in the subsidiary banks mortgage origination volume 
in fiscal  quad city bank trust originated million of real estate loans and sold million  which resulted in gains of million 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income  growing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration have grown from at june  to million at june  growth in the current fiscal year resulted primarily from new trust relationships 
the company s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of quad city bank trust  the company formed a statutory business trust  which issued million of capital securities to the public for cash in june in conjunction with the formation of cedar rapids bank trust  the company sold approximately million of its common stock through a private placement offering in september  primarily to investors in the cedar rapids area 
critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s markets  including economic conditions throughout the midwest and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure  existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology 
as the company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio  it will enhance its methodology accordingly 
management may report a materially different amount for the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses 
although management believes the levels of the allowance as of both june  and were adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  or other factors  could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

even though there are numerous indications of emerging strength  it is not certain that this strength is sustainable 
in addition  consumer confidence may still be negatively impacted by the recent substantial decline in equity prices 
these events could still adversely affect cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  as a result of which  the company could experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans  and require further increases in the provision 
nonperforming assets 
the policy of the company is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if a payment in full of interest or principal is not expected or b principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both in the process of collection and well secured 
well secured is defined as collateral with sufficient market value to repay principal and all accrued interest 
a debt is in the process of collection if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course either through legal action  including judgment enforcement procedures  or in appropriate circumstances  through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to current status

the increase in nonaccrual loans was comprised of increases in commercial loans of thousand partially offset by decreases in both real estate loans of thousand and in consumer loans of thousand 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans was due primarily to the addition of a single  fully collateralized loan at quad city bank trust with an outstanding balance of thousand

the loans in the cedar rapids bank trust loan portfolio have been made fairly recently  and none of the loans have been categorized as nonperforming assets

as a result of their memberships in the fhlb of des moines  the subsidiary banks have the ability to borrow funds for short term or long term purposes under a variety of programs 
both quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust utilized fhlb advances for loan matching as a hedge against the possibility of rising interest rates or when these advances provided a less costly source of funds than customer deposits 
in june  the company issued  shares of trust preferred securities through its newly formed capital trust subsidiary 
on the company s financial statements  these securities are listed as company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debentures and were  at both june  and under current regulatory guidelines  these securities are considered to be tier capital  with certain limitations that are applicable to the company

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

additional information concerning the company and its business  including other factors that could materially affect the company s financial results  is included in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank 
management also reviews quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust s securities portfolios  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may decide to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at june  and june   an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in the net portfolio value resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points 
change in estimated increase interest estimated decrease in npv rates npv amount amount percent basis points june  june  june  june  june  june  dollars in thousands the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
