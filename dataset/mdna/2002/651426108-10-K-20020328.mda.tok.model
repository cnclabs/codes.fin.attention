competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
currently  the residential market in the santa clarita valley  including valencia  remains strong and has been capturing an increasing portion of los angeles county s new home sales 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
the industrial market in valencia is experiencing declining demand and rising vacancy rates since the national and regional economy has slowed and concerns linger over california s power crisis 
in addition  local competition has intensified as local business parks have opened or are in the planning stages

the appraised values of the company s remaining land and income producing properties in the valencia master planned community have increased from million in approximately  acres  the first year independent property appraisals were obtained  to million in approximately  acres 
in  newhall land initiated an aggressive unit repurchase program to capitalize on the investment opportunity to create unitholder value based upon the difference in the underlying asset values relative to newhall land s unit price 
consequently  the results reflect the removal of million in asset value for repurchases and million in distributions 
to fund these unit repurchases in  the company sold million in valencia land and million of income producing properties

inherent in the preparation of these financial statements are certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis taking into account historical experience and other relevant current factors 
therefore  actual results may differ from reported amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements as they relate to its business segments are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of the accounting policies management considers significant in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements follows 
revenue recognition the majority of revenues for the company result from land sales 
the company follows the provisions in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate fas  to record these sales 
fas provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenues can be recorded 
for example  fas requires a sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold 
percentage of completion when the company has an obligation to complete development on sold property it utilizes the percentage of completion method of accounting to record revenues and income 
under percentage of completion accounting  the company recognizes revenues and income based upon the ratio of development cost completed to the estimated total cost of the property sold  provided required sales recognition criteria have been met 
unearned revenues resulting from applying percentage of completion accounting are reported as deferred revenues in the liabilities section of the balance sheet 
the company estimates total project costs associated with the parcel sold 
revisions in profit estimates and changes in percentages complete are recorded in the consolidated statement of income in subsequent periods  as they become known and the development progresses toward completion 
project costs costs incurred after the earlier of specific plan or tentative map approval are capitalized as a cost of that project and included as an asset in land under development on the balance sheet 
preliminary planning and entitlement costs  including litigation costs  are charged to expense when incurred 
indirect costs that do not clearly relate to projects under development  including general and administrative expenses  are charged to expense when incurred 
cost allocations the company generally allocates onsite costs to individual parcels within a project on a square foot basis if the parcels in the project are of similar value 
in mixed use projects  where there may be both a residential and a commercial component with varying fair values  onsite costs are allocated to the respective parcels using the relative sales value method 
under the relative sales value method  each parcel in the project under development is allocated onsite costs in proportion to the estimated overall sales prices of the project such that each parcel to be sold reflects the same gross profit margin 
since this method requires the company to estimate the expected sales prices for the entire project  the profit margin on subsequent parcels sold will be impacted by both changes in the estimated total revenues as well as any changes in the estimated total costs of the project 
offsite improvements with regional benefit  such as freeway on ramps and off ramps and water storage tanks  are referred to as infrastructure costs 
the company estimates the total cost to develop the infrastructure within a defined major development area and allocates this cost to the land within the area 
changes in the estimated remaining infrastructure costs or changes in the remaining developable acreage will impact the infrastructure cost allocation and corresponding profit margin for unsold land within a major development area

with regard to the retail leaseback  accounting guidelines do not allow the consideration of any future new or renewal leasing activity to reduce the calculation of the net lease obligation 
as a result  the company recorded an accounting loss on the sale of the buildings of million in management believes that subleasing of the retail space will more than offset this accounting loss over the life of the leaseback and ultimately will result in additional revenues and income 
as of december  approximately of the retail space was leased compared to at december  no income producing properties were sold in  however  the company recognized million in deferred revenues and a loss of  on the sale of valencia marketplace  a  square foot high volume retail center

in june  a kern county superior court judge identified six issues in the newhall ranch environmental impact report eir as requiring further environmental review 
the six issues include the impact of the development on the salt creek wildlife corridor and on traffic in ventura county  biological impacts on the santa clara river corridor  consistency with the general plan and impacts in significant ecological areas  adequacy and reliability of the water supply  and a further alternative site analysis for the water reclamation plant location 
in april  an additional analysis document addressing the court s concerns was circulated for public review  comment and hearings 
in october  the regional planning commission approved the additional analyses performed by the company concerning the six issues 
the company anticipates the los angeles county board of supervisors approval of the additional analyses in and development is expected to commence in late however  the length of time the public hearings and judicial process will take is difficult to predict  and circumstances beyond the company s control could further delay resolution of the issues 
in addition  an adverse decision by the county or court and or additional legal action could further delay the start of newhall ranch development 
moreover  the recent california appellate court decision affecting the acquisition of california state water project water by the local water wholesale may further delay the start of development beyond see below in this section for a more detailed description of the decision 
in january  housing affordability advocates filed an appeal of the superior court s decision to dismiss its challenges to the newhall ranch eir

development opponents also have asked the puc for a re hearing concerning the puc s decision on the valencia water company s water management program as discussed in the residential home and land sales section above 
the length of time the public hearings and judicial process will take is difficult to predict  and circumstances beyond the company s control could further delay development 
in january  a california appellate court decertified an eir concerning the acquisition and importing of  acre feet of california state water project water by castaic lake water agency clwa  a water wholesaler serving the santa clarita valley 
the appellate court decertified the eir on the ground that it was based on another eir decertified by a northern california court last year 
the appellate court returned the case to a los angeles superior court  which now has the discretion to determine the status of clwa s water acquisition transaction 
the superior court may take several months before it renders a decision concerning the status of the acquisition 
although the eir and clwa s water acquisition transaction are matters outside the company s control  this pending case could cause additional delays to the development of the company s projects since clwa is a primary source of water for valencia water company 
income producing properties for  revenues and income from the company s income producing properties decreased and  respectively  from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the sale of income properties in and in  income property sales included one mixed use building  two office buildings and the chiquita canyon landfill

forward looking information except for historical matters  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
we have tried  wherever practical  to identify these forward looking statements by using words like anticipate  believe  estimate  target  project  expect  plan  and similar expressions

we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our current beliefs and are based on information currently available to us

these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to differ from those expressed in or implied by these statements 
see our risk factors below 
sales of real estate the majority of the company s revenues is generated by its real estate operations 
the ability of the company to consummate sales of real estate is dependent on various factors including  but not limited to  availability of financing to the buyer  agreement with buyers on definitive terms  regulatory and legal issues  and successful completion of the buyer s due diligence 
the fact that a real estate transaction has entered escrow does not necessarily mean that the transaction ultimately will close 
therefore  the timing of sales may differ from that anticipated by the company 
the inability to close sales as anticipated could adversely impact the recognition of revenue in any specific period 
economic conditions real estate development and commercial income property can be significantly impacted by general and local economic conditions  which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s real estate operations are concentrated in north los angeles county 
the southern california economy is profoundly affected by the entertainment  technology  defense and certain other segments 
consequently  all sectors of the company s real estate operations tend to be cyclical 
the regional economy  like that of the state and nationally  has slowed into a recession 
there can be no assurances that the recession will not worsen or the economy will recover in the near future 
inflation the company believes it is well positioned against the effects of inflation 
historically  during periods of inflation  the company has been able to increase selling prices of properties to offset rising costs of land development and construction 
a portion of the commercial income portfolio is protected from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in the company s leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation  while the underlying value of commercial properties has tended to rise over the long term 
interest rates and financing fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing have an important impact on the company s performance 
sales of the company s properties could be adversely impacted by the inability of buyers to obtain adequate financing 
further  the company s real estate development activities are dependent on the availability of adequate sources of capital 
certain of the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and would be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates 
competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
currently  the residential market in the santa clarita valley  including valencia  remains strong and has been capturing an increasing portion of los angeles county s new home sales 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
the industrial market in valencia is experiencing declining demand and rising vacancy rates since the national and regional economy has slowed and concerns linger over california s power crisis 
in addition  local competition has intensified as local business parks have opened or are in the planning stages 
geographic concentration the company s real estate development activities are focused on the  acres that it owns in north los angeles county 
the company s entire commercial income portfolio is located in the valencia area 
therefore  any factors affecting that concentrated area  such as changes in the housing market  economic conditions and environmental factors  which cannot be predicted with certainty  could affect future results 
exposure to natural occurrences and acts of terror the company s assets and real estate operations may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as earthquakes and weather conditions  and acts of terrorism or armed conflict that may cause damage to assets  delay progress and increase the costs of infrastructure construction and land development  and affect the pace of sales 
government regulation and entitlement risks in developing its projects  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating such matters as permitted land uses  density and traffic  and the provision of utility services such as electricity  water and waste disposal 
in addition  the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
this government regulation affects the types of projects which can be pursued by the company and increases the cost of development and ownership 
the company devotes substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with these requirements 
to varying degrees  certain permits and approvals will be required to complete the developments currently being undertaken or planned by the company 
furthermore  the timing  cost and scope of planned projects may be subject to legal challenges 
see following litigation discussion 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits for its projects may be beyond the company s control and could restrict or prevent development of otherwise desirable new projects 
the company s results of operations in any period will be affected by the amount of entitled properties the company has in inventory 
litigation the land use approval processes the company must follow to ultimately develop its projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of  and actual  third party challenges to planned real estate developments have provided additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation will  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation increase the costs and may adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
environmental remediation the company owns or formerly owned properties on which the company may be required to remediate environmental effects of prior releases of contamination by third parties 
future environmental costs are difficult to estimate because of factors such as  but are not limited to  the unknown magnitude of possible contamination  the unknown timing and extent of remediative actions that may be required  the determination of the company s potential liability  and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  the length of time to perform any required remediation or the successful pursuit of responsible third parties is difficult to predict 
the ability to  or length of time required to  remediate any property could increase the costs of  and restrict  prevent or delay the development of a new project

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company utilizes both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million of variable debt with an average interest rate of and million of fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of the company s long term fixed rate and variable rate debt at december  by expected maturity dates fair dollars in thousands thereafter total value mortgage and other debt fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate the company has a million revolving mortgage facility which bears interest at libor plus  against which no borrowings were outstanding at december  the company also has unsecured lines of credit consisting of a million line on which the interest rate is libor plus and a million line on which the rate is libor plus  against which borrowings of million and million were outstanding  respectively  at december  the amounts set forth in the table above assume that the outstanding amounts under the variable rate credit facilities will be repaid at the facilities respective maturity dates 
management believes that these lines will be renewed at maturity with similar terms  subject to market conditions existing at the times of renewal 
a million line of credit which matured in november was not renewed by the company 
the fair values of the company s fixed rate debt either approximate carrying value or are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based in the company s current incremental borrowing arrangements ranging from to 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of the company s long term fixed rate and variable rate debt at december  by expected maturity dates fair dollars in thousands thereafter total value mortgage and other debt fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt in order to maintain variable rate exposure at an acceptable level and by taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt 
in addition  the company s guideline for total debt is not to exceed of the appraised value of the income portfolio 
as of december  the company s debt to income portfolio ratio as
