year ended december net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
vicor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company adjusts its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company is required to adopt two new accounting standards in  fas and fas  that provide new guidance regarding potential impairment for goodwill and long lived assets  respectively see note to the financial statements 
these impairment assessments could result in additional impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets in the future

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  changes in the equity price of the company s investment in scipher plc  a uk company whose stock is traded on the london stock exchange  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as the company s cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  the company s exposure to market risk on interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
the company s short term investments consist mainly of corporate and government debt securities  a major portion of which have maturities of less than one year 
these debt securities are all highly rated investments  in which a significant portion have interest rates reset at auction at regular intervals 
as a result  the company believes there is minimal market risk to these investments 
the equity price risk for the company s investment in a uk company may be material as the market price of the stock has experienced significant fluctuations over the past several months see note to the financial statements 
the company s exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the operations of vjcl 
the company believes that this market risk is currently not material due to the relatively small size of vjcl s operations
