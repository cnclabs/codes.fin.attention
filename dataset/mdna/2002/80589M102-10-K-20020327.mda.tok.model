competition electric operations after the energy supply and pricing problems experienced in california in and  the efforts to restructure electric markets at the state level have slowed considerably 
many states that had considered legislation to restructure the electric industry have stopped such efforts or are proceeding more slowly 
in south carolina electric restructuring efforts remain stalled  and consideration of electric restructuring legislation is unlikely in further  while several companies have announced their intent to site merchant generating plants in the company s service territory  economic events  environmental concerns and other factors have slowed those efforts 
legislation or regulatory action at the federal level  particularly as part of a larger energy policy initiative  may be considered in the company is not able to predict whether any restructuring legislation or regulatory action will be enacted and  if it is  the conditions it will impose on utilities 
scana s electric and gas utility  sce g  has undertaken a variety of initiatives aimed at preparing for a restructured electric market 
these initiatives include obtaining accelerated recovery of electric regulatory assets  establishing open access transmission tariffs and selling bulk power to wholesale customers at market based rates 
marketing of services to commercial and industrial customers has increased significantly  and sce g has executed long term power supply contracts with a significant portion of its industrial customers 
the company believes that these actions  as well as numerous others that have been and will be taken  demonstrate its ability and commitment to succeed in the evolving operating environment 
gas distribution effective january  scana completed its acquisition of psnc 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase 
psnc is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of scana 
as a result of the transaction  scana became a registered public utility holding company under puhca 
gas transmission scg  when operational  will provide interstate transportation services for natural gas to markets in southeastern georgia and south carolina 
scg will transport natural gas from interconnections with southern natural at port wentworth  georgia  and from an import terminal owned by southern lng at elba island  near savannah  georgia 
the endpoint of scg s line will be at the site of sce g s proposed natural gas fired generating station in jasper county  south carolina 
in december scg filed an application with ferc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to acquire and build a pipeline from elba island  georgia to jasper county  south carolina 
the project has an anticipated in service date of november scpc s plan to convert from a closed system to an open access transportation only system has been postponed indefinitely due to a number of factors  including the impact of the current economic downturn and the lack of consistent customer support for the proposed plan of system conversion 
retail gas marketing scana energy  the company s nonregulated retail gas division in georgia  has maintained its position as the second largest marketer in georgia  with an approximate percent market share 
due to record high natural gas prices and cold winter temperatures  the georgia public service commission gpsc adopted emergency rules which prohibited gas marketers from disconnecting service to residential customers for non payment from mid january through march customers were also permitted to switch marketers without first paying outstanding balances owed to their previous provider 
as a result of this action  scana energy increased its allowance for uncollectible accounts in the first quarter of and  to the extent permitted by other gpsc rules  has implemented more stringent credit policies 
since that time  the gpsc has remained extremely active in its review and oversight of the natural gas marketplace 
in the summer of the gpsc placed restrictions on the length of time that customer deposits may be held by marketers and also called for other changes in the ways that marketers interact with their customers 
further  in september  georgia s governor called for the formation of a task force to study the impact of natural gas deregulation 
in january that task force reported its recommendations regarding further restructuring 
the georgia legislature is currently considering bills which  if enacted  would allow electric membership cooperatives to seek certification to market natural gas and provide for the establishment of a regulated alternative supplier of gas services 
these actions raise concern as to the level of additional restrictions which may be placed on marketers  including scana energy  and heighten the risks of scana energy s business efforts in that market 
scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution  transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including futures contracts  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
this factor and others eg  the level of bad debts experienced are  in the aggregate  used to establish retail pricing levels at scana energy 
as a result of the potential regulatory actions discussed above and other downward pricing pressures inherent in the competitive market  scana energy may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements arise primarily from the operational needs of scana subsidiaries  the company s construction program  the activities or investments of scana s subsidiaries and payment of dividends 
the ability of scana s regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
scana s regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  the company expects to seek increases in rates 
the company s future financial position and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
the estimated primary cash requirements for and the actual primary cash requirements for  excluding requirements for non nuclear fuel purchases  short term borrowings and dividends  are as follows millions of dollars property additions and construction expenditures  net of afc nuclear fuel expenditures investments maturing obligations  redemptions and sinking and purchase fund requirements total  approximately percent of total cash requirements was provided from internal sources in as compared to percent in for the years the company has an aggregate of  million of long term debt and preferred stock maturing  which includes an aggregate of million for sce g  million of purchase or sinking fund requirements for sce g s preferred stock and million for psnc 
sce g s long term debt maturities for the years include approximately million for sinking fund requirements all of which may be satisfied by deposit and cancellation of bonds issued upon the basis of property additions or bond retirement credits 
these obligations and other commitments are tabulated below 
contractual cash obligations less than after december  total year years years years millions of dollars long term and short term debt including interest     preferred stock sinking funds capital leases operating leases other commercial commitments  included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases 
certain of these contracts relate to regulated gas businesses  therefore  the effects of such contracts on gas costs are reflected in gas rates 
the forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions  but are not considered to be take or pay contracts 
in addition to these commercial commitments  the company is party to certain new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements have already been funded in cash 
these derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until such time as underlying transactions occur 
the company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness 
sales of additional equity securities may also occur 
the company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
financing limits and related matters the company s issuance of various securities including long term and short term debt is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions  the sec and ferc 
the following paragraphs describe the financing programs currently utilized by the company 
scana corporation scana has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities 
while issuance of these securities requires customary approvals discussed above  the indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued 
at december  scana had million of unused authorized lines of credit  of which million was committed and the remainder was uncommitted 
amounts outstanding under scana s lines of credit totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric  gas and transit rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term promissory notes and other matters 
sce g s first and refunding mortgage bond indenture  dated april  old mortgage  contains provisions prohibiting the issuance of additional bonds thereunder class a bonds unless net earnings as therein defined for consecutive months out of the months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all class a bonds to be outstanding bond ratio

financing transactions and other information the following financing transactions have occurred since january  o on january  scana issued million of two year floating rate notes maturing on january  the interest rate is reset quarterly based on three month libor plus basis points 
proceeds from the debt were used to reduce short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
o on january  sce g issued million of first mortgage bonds having an annual interest rate of percent and maturing on february  the proceeds from the sale of these bonds were used to reduce short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
o on february  psnc issued million of medium term notes having an annual interest rate of percent and maturing on february  the proceeds were used to reduce short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
o on may  scana issued million of medium term notes maturing may  and bearing a fixed interest rate of percent 
scana also entered into an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a fair value hedge  to pay variable rate and receive fixed rate interest payments 
the proceeds from the issuance of the medium term notes were used to refinance million of bank notes originally issued to finance scana s acquisition of psnc 
the swap agreement was terminated and replaced with another swap agreement to pay variable rate and receive fixed rate interest payments  also designated as a fair value hedge  in august approximately million received upon the original swap s termination is being amortized over the term of the associated debt 
o on december  psnc entered into two interest rate swap agreements to pay variable rate and receive fixed rate interest payments on a combined notional amount of million 
these swaps were designated as fair value hedges of psnc s million  percent senior debentures due and million  percent senior debentures due o on january  scana issued million of medium term notes maturing february  and bearing a fixed interest rate of percent 
also on january  scana issued million of two year floating rate notes maturing on february  the interest rate on the floating rate notes is reset quarterly based on three month libor plus basis points 
proceeds from these issuances were used to refinance million of two year floating rate notes that matured on february   which had been issued to finance scana s acquisition of psnc 
o on january  sce g issued million of first mortgage bonds having an annual interest rate of percent and maturing february  the proceeds from the sale of these bonds were used to reduce short term debt primarily incurred as a result of sce g s construction program and to redeem its first and refunding mortgage bonds  percent series due august  the company s electric and natural gas businesses are seasonal in nature  with the primary demand for electricity being experienced during summer and winter and the primary demand for natural gas being experienced during winter 
as a result of the significant increase during the latter half of in the cost to the company of natural gas and the colder than normal weather experienced in december  the company experienced significant increases in its working capital requirements  contributing to the need for the financings by scana and psnc in early described above 
the more recent borrowings were necessitated by the cash requirements of the construction program  including the projects described below 
sce g is constructing a million gas turbine generator project in aiken county  south carolina 
two combined cycle turbines will burn natural gas to produce megawatts of new electric generation and use exhaust heat to replace coal fired steam that powers two existing megawatt turbines at the urquhart generating station 
the turbine project is scheduled to be completed by june in october ferc notified sce g of its agreement with sce g s plan to reinforce lake murray dam in order to maintain the lake in case of an extreme earthquake 
construction for the project and related activities  which began in the third quarter of  is expected to cost million and be completed in any costs incurred by sce g are expected to be recoverable through electric rates 
in october sce g filed with the scpsc its siting plans to construct an megawatt generation facility in jasper county  south carolina  to supply electricity to its south carolina customers 
the facility will include three natural gas combustion turbine generators and one steam turbine generator 
construction of the million facility is expected to begin in april  with commercial operation in the summer of in connection with the facility  sce g has signed a megawatt electric supply contract with north carolina electric membership corporation for a term of at least nine years beginning january  environmental matters electric operations the clean air act amendments of caa required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox substantially by the year the company s compliance with these reductions has been accomplished 
the epa has indicated that it will propose regulations by december for stricter limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants generated by coal fired plants 
sce g and genco currently estimate that air emissions control equipment will require capital expenditures of million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
in october the epa issued a final rule requiring states  including south carolina  to modify their state implementation plans to address the issue of nox pollution 
while not final  south carolina has proposed nox reductions that would require the company to install pollution control equipment to reduce its nox emissions 
capital expenditures will be required to comply with the nox reductions and they are included in the cost figures above 
the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the industry and the department of justice has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
the company and sce g have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any assertions relative to the company s and sce g s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
however  if successful  such assertions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the federal clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program in monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company has been developing compliance plans for these initiatives 
amendments to the clean water act proposed in congress include several provisions which  if passed  could prove costly to sce g and genco 
these include  but are not limited to  limitations to mixing zones and the implementation of technology based standards 
gas distribution the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate to regulated operations and are deferred and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
deferred amounts for sce g  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters 
o in september the epa notified sce g  among others  of its potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of the calhoun park area site in charleston  south carolina 
this site encompasses approximately acres and includes properties which were locations for various industrial operations  including one of sce g s decommissioned mgps 
field work at the site began in november and has required the submission of several investigative reports and the implementation of several work plans 
in september sce g was notified by the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec that benzene contamination was detected in the intermediate aquifer on surrounding properties of the calhoun park area site 
the epa required that sce g conduct a focused remedial investigation feasibility study on the intermediate aquifer  which was completed in june the epa expects to issue a record of decision dealing with the intermediate aquifer and sediments in june sce g anticipates that major remediation activities will be completed in  with certain monitoring activities continuing until as of december   sce g has spent approximately million to remediate the calhoun park area site 
total remediation costs are estimated to be million 
o sce g owns three other decommissioned mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
two of these sites are currently being remediated under work plans approved by dhec 
sce g is continuing to investigate the remaining site and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities for these three sites will be completed between sce g has spent approximately million related to these sites  and expects to incur an additional million 
in addition  psnc owns  or has owned  all or portions of seven sites in north carolina on which mgps were formerly operated 
intrusive investigation including drilling  sampling and analysis has begun at two sites and the remaining sites have been evaluated using historical records and observations of current site conditions 
these evaluations have revealed that mgp residuals are present or suspected at several of the sites 
psnc estimates that the cost to remediate the sites would range between million and million 
the estimated cost range has not been discounted to present value 
psnc s associated actual costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
at december  psnc has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  which reflects the minimum amount of the range  net of shared cost recovery expected from other prps and expenditures for work completed 
amounts incurred to date are approximately million 
management believes that all mgp cleanup costs incurred will be recoverable through gas rates 
regulatory matters state regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets some costs that would be expensed by other enterprises 
if deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  the company may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets from its balance sheet 
although the potential effects of deregulation cannot be determined at present  discontinuation of the accounting treatment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is expected that cash flows and the financial position of the company would not be materially affected by the discontinuation of the accounting treatment 
the company reported approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  including amounts recorded for deferred income tax assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  on its balance sheet at december  the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in these assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december  the company s net investment in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets was  million and million  respectively 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric  gas and transit rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term promissory notes and other matters 
electric on april  the scpsc approved sce g s request to increase the fuel component of rates charged to electric customers from cents per kilowatt hour to cents per kilowatt hour 
the increase reflects higher fuel costs projected for the period may through april the increase also provides recovery over a two year period of under collected actual fuel costs through april  including short term purchased power costs necessitated by outages at two of sce g s base load generating plants in winter the new rates were effective as of the first billing cycle in may on september  the scpsc approved an accelerated capital recovery plan for sce g s cope generating station 
the plan was implemented beginning january  for a three year period 
the scpsc approved an accelerated capital recovery methodology wherein sce g may increase depreciation of its cope generating station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates 
the amount of the accelerated depreciation will be determined by sce g based on the level of revenues and operating expenses  not to exceed million annually without the approval of the scpsc 
any unused portion of the million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year 
as of december   no accelerated depreciation has been recorded 
the accelerated capital recovery plan will be accomplished through existing customer rates 
on january  the scpsc authorized a return on common equity of percent 
the scpsc also approved establishment of a storm damage reserve account capped at million to be collected through rates over a ten year period 
additionally  the scpsc approved accelerated amortization of a significant portion of sce g s electric regulatory assets excluding deferred income tax assets and the remaining transition obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which enabled sce g to recover the balances as of the end of the year gas sce g s rates are established using a cost of gas component approved by the scpsc which may be modified periodically to reflect changes in the price of natural gas purchased by sce g

november december on july  the scpsc approved sce g s request to implement lower depreciation rates for its gas operations 
the new rates were effective retroactively to january  and resulted in a reduction in annual depreciation expense of approximately million 
the retroactive effect was recorded in the second quarter of in the scpsc issued an order approving sce g s request to recover through a billing surcharge to its gas customers the costs of environmental cleanup at the sites of former mgps 
the billing surcharge is subject to annual review and provides for the recovery of substantially all actual and projected site assessment and cleanup costs and environmental claims settlements for sce g s gas operations that had previously been deferred 
in october  as a result of the annual review  the scpsc approved sce g s request to increase the billing surcharge from cents per therm to cents per therm  which is intended to provide for the recovery  prior to the end of the year  of the balance remaining at december  of million 
transit in september the scpsc issued an order granting sce g s request for a 
increase in transit fares from 
to 
in columbia  south carolina  however  the scpsc also required 
fares for low income customers and denied sce g s request for certain bus route and schedule changes 
the new rates were placed into effect in october after several appeals and petitions for reconsideration to the circuit court and the supreme court by the various parties  on september  the scpsc issued an order granting certain relief requested by sce g 
on september  the consumer advocate filed a motion with the scpsc for a stay of this order 
on october  the scpsc accepted the consumer advocate s motion and issued a stay of its order 
the consumer advocate and other intervenors have petitioned the circuit court for judicial review of the scpsc s order granting relief 
the circuit court has held in abeyance any appellate review pending the outcome of current negotiations on the transfer of the transit system from sce g to an unaffiliated regional transit authority

this mechanism allows psnc to collect from its customers amounts approximating the amounts paid for natural gas 
a state expansion fund  established by the north carolina general assembly in and funded by refunds from psnc s interstate pipeline transporters  provides financing for expansion into areas that otherwise would not be economically feasible to serve 
on december  psnc filed an application with the ncuc to extend natural gas service to madison  jackson and swain counties  north carolina 
on june  the ncuc approved psnc s requests for disbursement of up to million from psnc s expansion fund for this project 
psnc estimates that the cost of this project will be approximately million 
the madison county portion of the project was completed at a cost of approximately million  and customers began receiving service in july on december  the ncuc issued an order approving scana s acquisition of psnc 
as specified in the ncuc order  psnc reduced its rates by approximately million in each of august and august  and agreed to a moratorium on general rate cases until august general rate relief can be obtained during this period to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events 
on february  the ncuc approved psnc s application to use expansion funds to extend natural gas service into alexander county and authorized disbursements from the fund of approximately million 
most of alexander county lies within psnc s certificated service territory and did not previously have natural gas service 
the project was completed at a cost of approximately million  and customers began receiving natural gas service in march scana energy georgia see discussion at competition regarding the regulatory framework of the company s business in the georgia retail natural gas market 
regulatory matters federal effective with its acquisition of psnc  scana became a registered public utility holding company under puhca 
scana and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec as to financings  acquisitions and diversifications  affiliate transactions and other matters 
the company s regulated business operations were impacted by ferc orders no 
 and order no 
was intended to deregulate the markets for interstate sales of natural gas by requiring that pipelines provide transportation services that are equal in quality for all gas suppliers whether the customer purchases gas from the pipeline or another supplier 
orders no 
and require utilities under ferc jurisdiction that own  control or operate transmission lines to file nondiscriminatory open access tariffs that offer to others the same transmission service they provide to themselves and to submit plans for the possible formation of an rto 
in the opinion of the company  it continues to be able to meet successfully the challenges of these altered business climates and does not anticipate any material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows  financial position or business prospects 
as already noted  order no 
required utilities which operate electric transmission systems to submit plans for the possible formation of rtos 
in march ferc gave provisional approval to sce g and two other southeastern electric utilities to establish gridsouth transco  llc gridsouth as an independent regional transmission company  responsible for operating and planning the utilities combined transmission systems 
in july ferc expressed its desire that utilities throughout the united states combine their transmission systems to create four large independent regional operators  one each in the northeast  southeast  midwest and west 
accordingly ferc ordered mediation talks to take place between the utilities forming gridsouth and certain groups that had proposed other rtos 
these talks were mediated by an administrative law judge  who issued her nonbinding mediation report to ferc in september the report made recommendations related to the formation of a southeast regional rto 
while ferc has not acted on the mediation report  and the timing or impact of future ferc orders related to rtos cannot be predicted  sce g expects to be reimbursed or to otherwise recover costs it has incurred in connection with rto formation 
critical accounting policies and new accounting standards following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting results of operations 
sfas scana s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
aside from other impacts which might be experienced as a result of deregulation or other significant changes in the regulatory environments of the utilities  sfas could cease to be applicable and the company could be required to write off such regulatory assets and liabilities see also competition 
provisions for bad debts allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  scana and its subsidiaries evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of actual write offs which might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
investments in debt and equity securities scana and certain of its subsidiaries hold investments in marketable securities  some of which are subject to sfas mark to market accounting and some of which are considered cost basis investments for which determination of fair value historically has been considered impracticable 
equity holdings subject to sfas are categorized as available for sale and are carried at quoted market  with any unrealized gains and losses credited or charged to other comprehensive income within common equity on the company s balance sheet 
debt securities are categorized as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
when indicated  and in accordance with its stated accounting policy  scana performs periodic assessments of whether any decline in the value of these securities to amounts below scana s cost basis is other than temporary 
when other than temporary declines occur  write downs are recorded through operations  and new lower cost bases are established 
during  as a result of a determination that an other than temporary decline in value an impairment had occurred  scana wrote down its investments in itc deltacom in the amount of approximately million net of tax 
similarly  on march  the company determined that the decline in value of its investment in dtag to below its cost basis of per share was other than temporary  and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million after tax 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
scana also from time to time holds investments in joint ventures  partnerships or other equity method investees for which evaluation of the existence and quantification of other than temporary declines in value may be required 
whenever indicated these write downs are also recorded through earnings 
during scana wrote down two such investments in the aggregate amount of million net of tax 
although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  and it does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions other than incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture and equipment 
goodwill amortization and impairment analysis sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  were issued during sfas will require all future acquisitions to be accounted for utilizing the purchase method 
scana considers the amounts categorized by ferc as acquisition adjustments to be goodwill as defined in sfas and has ceased amortization of such amounts upon the adoption of sfas effective january  in the amount of such amortization expense recorded was million 
this amortization related to acquisition adjustments of approximately million carried on the books of psnc and approximately million carried on the books of scpc 
as required by the provisions of sfas  the company is performing initial valuation analyses to determine whether these carrying amounts are impaired  and if so  the amount of any write down which might be recorded as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
as allowed by the statement the company will have completed the initial stage of those analyses by june  if any write downs are indicated by those analyses  they will be quantified and recorded by the end of because the company is in the early stages of these analyses the effect  if any  of the adoption of the impairment provisions of the statement is not known  however  if write downs are considered necessary  they could be material to the company s results of operations for pension accounting scana follows sfas in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan 
scana s plan is fully funded and as such  significant net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of an percent discount rate and an assumed percent long term return on plan assets 
scana believes that these assumptions are  and that the resulting pension income amount is  reasonable 
were scana to have alternatively selected a discount rate of percent and a rate of return on assets of percent  the net pension income recorded in would have been reduced by approximately million 
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions similar to its pension accounting  scana follows sfas in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no return on assets impacts the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
scana used a discount rate of percent and recorded a net sfas cost of million for were the selected discount rate to have been percent  the expense would have been approximately million higher 
derivatives effective january  scana follows the provisions of sfas in accounting for its derivatives and hedging activities 
substantially all of scana s use of derivatives occurs in the normal course of its risk management processes and is generally confined to contracts which qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of sfas the company is party to interest rate swaps and to nymex traded natural gas contracts 
the company values its nymex gas derivatives at fair value based on quoted market prices  and values an insignificant number and value of non exchange traded gas related derivatives using information provided by counterparties to those transactions or by reference to quoted market prices of listed contracts 
the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps is similarly based on settlement amounts obtained from the counterparties 
as a result of adopting sfas the company recorded a credit of approximately million  net of tax  as the effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment to other comprehensive income on january  this amount represents the reclassification of unrealized gains that were deferred and reported as liabilities at december  in the future all gains and losses related to qualifying cash flow hedges deferred in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings at the time the hedged transactions affect earnings 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  provides guidance for recording and disclosing a liability related to the future obligation to retire an asset such as a nuclear plant 
the company will adopt sfas effective january  the impact sfas may have on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position has not been determined but could be material 
the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  are effective january  this statement requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
there was no impact on the company s financial statements from the initial adoption of sfas affiliate transactions scana and its consolidated affiliates engage in certain intercompany transactions  subject to the restrictions imposed by puhca 
among these transactions are the sale of gas to sce g by scpc and the provision of administrative services to all members of the consolidated group by scana services 
in addition to these transactions and investment transactions discussed at other matters  the company has engaged in the following transactions with other entities considered to be affiliates

under a plan approved by the scpsc  any tax credits generated and ultimately passed through to sce g have been and will be deferred and used to offset defined capital expenditures such as those related to reduction of environmental emissions

instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge risks associated with fixed price obligations in a volatile market and risks associated with price differentials at different delivery locations 
the basic types of financial instruments utilized are exchange traded instruments  such as nymex futures contracts or options and over the counter instruments such as swaps  which are typically offered by energy and financial institutions 
risk limits are established to control the level of market  credit  liquidity and operational administrative risks assumed by the company 
the company s board of directors has delegated the authority for setting market risk limits to the risk management committee  which is comprised of members of senior management  the company s controller  the senior vice president of scpc and the president of energy marketing 
the risk management committee provides assurance to the board of directors with regard to compliance with risk management policies and brings to the board s attention any areas of concern 
written policies define the physical and financial transactions that are approved as well as the authorization requirements for transactions that are allowed 
the nymex futures information above includes those financial positions of both energy marketing and scpc 
the ultimate effects of the hedging activities of scpc are passed through to its customers through scpc s fuel adjustment clauses 
equity price risk investments in telecommunications companies equity securities are carried at their market value or  if market value is not readily determinable  at their cost 
the company s investments in such securities totaled million at december  a temporary decline in value of ten percent would result in a million reduction in fair value and a corresponding adjustment  net of tax effect  to the related equity account for unrealized gains losses  a component of other comprehensive income
