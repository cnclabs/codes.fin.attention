over the last few years  the company has experienced increased pressures on reimbursement and expects such pressures to cause reduced unit pricing for diagnostic and prognostic analyses in future periods 
the revenue generated from private insurance and managed care has increased significantly as a percentage of total revenue in the last three years as a result of increased focus by the company s sales force on oncology offices as well as a desire by the company s hospital clients to have the company bill third parties directly 
despite those pressures  the company has experienced increasing average reimbursement trends due to changes in its product mix and application of new technologies

tamtron is a san jose  california  based company and its major product  powerpath  is a technology system designed specifically for companies providing surgical pathology  cytology and autopsy services anatomic pathology to streamline operations and support multi site or multi entity healthcare networks

see forward looking statements critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically contractual and bad debt allowances for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
the company generally recognizes revenue for services rendered upon completion of the testing process 
revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party and government payors  and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with certain payors 
retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
revenue from ipo is recognized within the guidance contained in the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues are recognized upon completion of analysis in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in cases where the contract calls for the biological specimen to be shipped  revenue is recognized upon shipment of the biological material to the customer 
revenue from the information services division is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
all license agreements have support and maintenance obligations by the company 
contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of contractual allowances and potential future uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue and expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
evaluation of possible impairment is based on the company s ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset  including any goodwill associated with the asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset 
see new accounting standards footnote p regarding two recently issued accounting standards on business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of but do not believe a material impairment charge will be recorded 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices on the company has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has not been material to date to the company s operations 
in the future  the company s revenue realization per case may not be sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although the company is responding to these concerns by attempting to increase the volume and adjust the product mix of its business 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually and an impairment charge will be recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value 
the provisions of sfas have been adopted for any business combination consummated after june  goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date is after june  will not be amortized 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas  related to goodwill acquired prior to june  and intangible assets  on january  the adoption of this accounting standard is expected to reduce the amount of amortization of goodwill recorded in our consolidated financial statements by approximately million annually  commencing january  the company is in the process of finalizing its evaluation of its goodwill and intangible assets for its reporting units and expects to complete its review during first quarter in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes sfas no 
sfas further refines sfas s requirement that companies recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows and measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
in addition  sfas provides guidance on accounting and disclosure issues surrounding long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also extends the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after december  for the company 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of us corporate debt  us government debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate or return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at december   more than of our holdings were in instruments maturing in two years or less and more than of such holdings matured in one year or less
