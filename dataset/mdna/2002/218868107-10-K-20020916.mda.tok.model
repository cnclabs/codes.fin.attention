item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges  with more than  students  in states 
during the fiscal year ended june   our company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition  enrollment fees and bookstore sales  and are presented as net revenues after adjustments related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenue on a pro rata basis over the expected duration of the students enrollment for diploma programs and over the quarter for students enrolled in degree programs 
net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase is largely the result of a increase in the student population and a increase in the average tuition rate per student during the period 
tuition revenues  which represented of fiscal total net revenues  fluctuate with the aggregate enrolled student population and the average program or credit hour charge 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts occur on a monthly basis in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level  such as diploma  or associate s  bachelor s or master s degree  and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we categorize our expenses as educational services  general and administrative  and marketing and advertising 
educational services expense is primarily comprised of those costs incurred to deliver and administer the education programs at the colleges  including faculty and college administration compensation  education materials and supplies  college facility rent and other occupancy costs  bad debt expense  depreciation and amortization of college property and equipment  and default management expenses and financial aid processing costs 
general and administrative expense consist principally of those costs incurred at the corporate and regional level in support of college operations  except for marketing and advertising related costs 
included in general and administrative costs are expenses relating to executive management  corporate staff and regional operations management compensation  rent and other occupancy costs for corporate 
table of contents headquarters  depreciation and amortization of corporate property and equipment and certain intangibles  bonus expenses  and other expenses incurred at corporate headquarters 
marketing and advertising expense includes compensation for college admissions staff  regional admissions directors  compensation paid at corporate for marketing and advertising management  and all direct advertising and production costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we maintain a revenue recognition policy 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught in our colleges 
revenue from tuition and fees are recognized pro rata on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable course or program 
if a student withdraws from a course or program  the paid but unearned portion of the student tuition is refunded 
textbook sales and other revenues are recognized as sales occur or services are performed and represent less than of total revenues 
prepaid tuition is the portion of payments received but not earned and is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as such amount is expected to be earned within the next year 
marketing and advertising expense 
we maintain an advertising expense recognition policy 
marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
we have significant marketing and advertising expenses consisting primarily of payroll and payroll related expenses  direct response and other advertising  promotional materials and other related marketing costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 

table of contents intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets  including goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
although we believe our intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to record asset balances 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets at least annually 
acquisitions since our inception  we have completed the following acquisitions  each of which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of their operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition on june   we acquired five colleges from national education corporation

student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new school openings  new program introductions and increased high school enrollments 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period
