these statements represent the company s expectations or beliefs  including  but not limited to  statements concerning future financial and operating results  anticipated growth in revenues and profit margins  improvements in management personnel  the impact of european operations  the utilization of inventories and facilities  statements concerning industry performance  the company s operations  economic performance  financial condition  growth and acquisition strategies  margins and growth in sales of the company s products 
for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  words such as may  will  expect  believe  anticipate  intend  could  estimate or continue or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond the company s control  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors  including without limitation uncertainty related to government regulation  the effect of adverse publicity  litigation  the centralized location of the company s manufacturing operations  availability of raw materials  risks associated with international operations  competition  product liability claims  volatility of stock price and those factors described in this and other company filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates the estimates including those related to bad debts and inventories 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
reserve for inventory the company records valuation reserves on its inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if future product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
depreciation of long lived assets the company assigns useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets 
any change in these asset lives would be reported in the statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
accounting for income taxes the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure for the company together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as property  plant and equipment depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from final tax exam reviews 
at june   the company assessed the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based upon the historical operating losses and the uncertainty regarding sufficient near term taxable income  management believes that this evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance of  is recorded at june  should the company determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded to operations in the period such determination was made

the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to incremental spending for dtc of million and  related to reorganizing of the company s manufacturing and sales organizations 
additionally  inadequate performance by the company s former rd party dtc call and fulfillment center provider resulted in significantly higher processing and customer services costs 
the company replaced the former dtc call and fulfillment center in december and began an aggressive campaign to resolve the customer service issues resulting in additional charges of approximately  the start up costs associated with the new dtc call and fulfillment center were approximately  fiscal operating expenses included a charge of million reflecting the write down of intangible assets acquired and additional expenses associated with the attempted commercialization of the underlying software obtained from the fitnessage and custom nutrition ventures

the sales decline was primarily due to the loss of three customers  which represented combined net sales of million in fiscal versus  for fiscal loss of these three customers reflects the risk associated with our core business where price cost is a prime driver 
sales to our second largest customer declined in by to million from million for fiscal fiscal sales were higher as this customer purchased large quantities of product from the company to support a major product introduction  while fiscal sales volumes have stabilized at lower levels 
the sales decreases associated with these customers were offset by increases with other existing customers

the company recorded a net loss for fiscal of million per share compared to a net loss of million per share for fiscal the change in net loss from fiscal to fiscal reflected a favorable change in operations offset by the significant charge to income taxes as described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations through cash flow from operations  capital and operating lease transactions  working capital credit facilities and equipment financing arrangements 
at june   the company had cash of approximately  an increase from approximately  at june  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
proceeds from the vitamin antitrust litigation of approximately million are included in cash provided by operating activities 
the company used approximately  in investing activities primarily on capital expenditures that were partially offset by the repayment of notes receivable 
the company used approximately million in financing activities to pay down debt by approximately million and place a million cash deposit as collateral for the company s amended working capital line of credit agreement 
capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately  these expenditures relate primarily to the continuing development of the swiss manufacturing facility of approximately  and domestic manufacturing and information system improvements of approximately  the domestic capital expenditures for manufacturing were spent on the acquisition of equipment primarily for our finished goods packaging operation 
additional expenditures were made to improve the company s management information system as well as to improve speed and security of the company s local area and web based networks 
these expenditures were funded primarily from cash provided by operations 
at june   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the million increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in current assets of million offset by an increase in current liabilities of million 
the change in current assets was primarily due to an increase in inventories of approximately million  an income tax receivable of million and cash and restricted cash of million

the composite interest rate on all outstanding debt as of june  was approximately 
the company has access to funds from the existing working capital credit facility to support future ongoing operating requirements of approximately million  net of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of june  of approximately 
the working capital line of credit facilities are subject to eligibility requirements for current accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of june  total excess borrowing capacity based on eligible working capital balances was approximately million

under the terms of the amended agreement  maximum borrowings remain at million  the interest rate was decreased to prime plus and existing financial covenants were removed 
the amended agreement requires the company to maintain a minimum cash balance of million with the secured creditor 
the amount outstanding under the working capital line of credit agreement is to be paid upon expiration of the agreement on october  the company is working with prospective lenders to replace the current working capital line of credit facility 
the company believes that its available cash and existing credit facility should be sufficient to fund near term operating activities 
however  the company s ability to fund future operations and meet capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to continued profitability from operations  the ability to seek additional financing  the effectiveness of the company s diversified growth strategy  the effectiveness of the expansion of european operations and the ability to establish additional customers or changes to existing customer s business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates  and foreign exchange rates affecting the return on its investments and the cost of its debt 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest or foreign exchange rates 
at june   the company s cash equivalents consisted of financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
the company s debt as of june  totaled million of fixed rate loans 
the average composite interest rate at june  for fixed rate loans was 
the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rate between the swiss franc and the us dollar 
on june   the swiss franc closed at to us dollar 
the same rate was swiss francs to us dollar at june  foreign exchange losses for the year ended june  were  an immediate adverse change of one hundred basis points in interest rates would increase interest expense on an annual basis by  a adverse change to the swiss franc exchange rate would decrease earnings by  risk factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information included in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating the company s business and future prospects 
the company s business and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
recent operating income  increasing sales the company s income from operations was  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to a loss from operations of million for fiscal sales for the fiscal year ended june  increased to approximately million  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that income from operations will continue 
the company expects operating results may further fluctuate from period to period as a result of differences in when it incurs expenses and recognizes revenues from product sales 
some of these fluctuations may be significant 
reliance on limited number of customers for the fiscal year ended june   the company had two major customers  which together accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
the loss of any of these major customers  or any substantial reduction of their purchases from the company  would have a material adverse impact on the business  operations and financial condition of the company 
reliance on a key personality for the fiscal year ended june   the company s dtc product line was approximately of the company s net sales 
dtc products are marketed with a key personality through a variety of distribution channels including weekly television programming  internet and a monthly newsletter 
the inability of the key personality to fulfill his current role  the reduction of television exposure or the reduction of internet or mailing capabilities would have a material adverse impact on the business  operations and financial condition of the company 
potential for increased competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company competes with other dietary supplement products and over the counter pharmaceutical manufacturers 
among other factors  competition among these manufacturers is based upon price 
if one or more manufacturers significantly reduce their prices in an effort to gain market share  the company s business  operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
many of the company s competitors  particularly manufacturers of nationally advertised brand name products  are larger and have resources substantially greater than those of the company 
there has been speculation about the potential for increased participation in these markets by major international pharmaceutical companies 
in the future  if not already  one or more of these companies could seek to compete more directly with the company by manufacturing and distributing their own or others products  or by significantly lowering the prices of existing national brand products 
the company sells substantially all of its supplement products to customers who re sell and distribute the products 
although the company does not currently participate significantly in other channels such as health food stores  direct mail  and internet sales  the company is expanding its operations and its products  including direct mail and internet sales  and will likely face increased competition in such distribution and sales channels as more vendors and customers utilize them 
availability of line of credit the company s current million line of credit expires on october  the lender has not committed to extend the facility and is not planning to renew it 
the liquidity provided by a line of credit is an important component of a sound financial management plan 
the company is in negotiations with other lenders for a replacement line of credit 
there can be no assurance the current lender will extend the existing credit line or the company will obtain a replacement credit facility or  if it does  that the terms of the new facility will be as favorable or better than those of the current credit line 
failure to obtain a new line of credit could materially impair the company s ability to fund growth in operations or meet other working capital needs in the future 
reliance on limited number of suppliers  availability and cost of purchased materials the company purchases certain products it does not manufacture from a limited number of raw material suppliers 
mannatech comprised of the company s total raw material purchases for the year ended june  no other supplier represented more than of total raw material purchases for the year ended june  although the company currently has supply arrangements with several suppliers of these raw materials  and such materials are generally available from numerous sources  the termination of the supply relationship by any material supplier or an unexpected interruption of supply could materially adversely affect the company s business  operations and financial condition 
the company relies on a single supplier to process certain raw materials for a product line of the company s largest customer 
an unexpected interruption of supply of this service would materially adversely affect the company s business  operations and financial condition 
decline in stock price the company s stock price has experienced volatility  has generally declined during the past few years and is currently near historic lows 
in view of the company s recent results and the fact there can be no assurances of future profitability  there can be no assurance that the stock price will not decline 
market conditions in the vitamin and nutritional supplement industry  such as increased price competition  consolidation  oversupply of vitamin and supplement products  operating results of competitors  adverse publicity and other factors such as customer and product announcements by the company and operating results which are lower than the expectations of analysts and our investors  may have a continuing adverse effect on the price of the company s stock 
effect of adverse publicity the company s products consist primarily of dietary supplements vitamins  minerals  herbs and other ingredients 
the company regards these products as safe when taken as suggested by the company 
in addition  various scientific studies have suggested the ingredients in some of the company s products may involve health benefits 
the company believes the growth in the dietary supplements business of the last several years may  in part  be based on significant media attention and various scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from the consumption of certain vitamin products 
the company is indirectly dependent upon its customers perception of the overall integrity of its business  as well as the safety and quality of its products and similar products distributed by other companies which may not adhere to the same quality standards as the company 
the business  operations  and financial condition of the company could be adversely affected if any of the company s products or any similar products distributed by other companies should prove or be asserted to be harmful to consumers  or should scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding the effect of products similar to those produced by the company 
exposure to product liability claims the company  like other retailers  distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  faces a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products allegedly results in injury 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage  including primary product liability and excess liability coverage 
the cost of such coverage has increased dramatically in the last year and the availability of adequate insurance coverage has decreased 
there can be no assurance that adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available at an economically reasonable cost or that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover any liability the company incurs in respect to all possible product liability claims 
in addition  some of the ingredients included in one or more of the products manufactured by the company are subject to controversy involving potential negative side effects or questionable health benefits 
some insurers  including some providing coverage to the company  have recently excluded certain of these ingredients from their product liability coverage 
although the company s product liability insurance does not presently have any such limitations  the company s insurer could require such exclusions or limitations on coverage in the future 
in such event  the company may have to cease utilizing the ingredients or may have to rely on indemnification or similar arrangements with its customers who wish to continue to include such ingredients in their products 
in such an event  the consequential increase in product liability risk or the loss of customers or product lines could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations  and financial condition 
risks associated with international markets the company s growth may be dependent in part upon its ability to expand its operations and those of its customers into new markets  including international markets 
for the fiscal year ended june  and  the percentage of the company s net sales to customers in international markets was approximately and  respectively 
naie operates a manufacturing facility in switzerland  which is intended to facilitate an increase in sales of the company s products overseas and which contributed approximately and of the company s net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company may experience difficulty expanding in international markets due to regulatory barriers  the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems  and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems 
operating in international markets exposes the company to certain risks  including  among other things  changes in or interpretations of foreign import  currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that among other things may limit the company s ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the united states  exposure to currency fluctuations  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs  and economic and political instability 
as the company continues to expand its international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
government regulation the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling and advertising of the company s products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the united states food and drug administration fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture  the united states postal service  the united states environmental protection agency  and the occupational safety and health administration 
the company s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which the company s products are sold 
in particular  the fda regulates the safety  labeling and distribution of dietary supplements  including vitamins  minerals  herbs  food  and over the counter and prescription drugs and cosmetics 
in addition  the ftc has overlapping jurisdiction with the fda to regulate the labeling  promotion and advertising of vitamins  over the counter drugs  cosmetics and foods 
the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea was enacted on october  dshea amends the federal food  drug and cosmetic act by defining dietary supplements  which include vitamins  minerals  nutritional supplements and herbs as a new category of food separate from conventional food 
dshea provides a regulatory framework to ensure safe  quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products 
under dshea  the fda is generally prohibited from regulating the active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims  such as claims that a product may heal  mitigate  cure or prevent an illness  disease or malady  trigger drug status 
dshea provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements 
dshea permits substantiated  truthful and non misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling  such as statements describing general well being resulting from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or function of the body 
the company anticipates the fda will finalize manufacturing process regulations that are specific to dietary supplements and require at least some of the quality control provisions applicable to drugs 
the company currently manufactures its vitamins and nutritional supplement products in compliance with the food good manufacturing processes 
the fda is developing additional regulations to implement dshea 
labeling regulations may require expanded or different labeling for the company s vitamin and nutritional products 
the company cannot determine what effect such regulations  when fully implemented  will have on its business in the future 
such regulations could  among other things  require the recall  reformulation or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  warnings  notification procedures and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products or scientific substantiation regarding ingredients  product claims  safety or efficacy 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on the company or the manufacturers of its products  including warning letters  fines  product recalls and seizures 
governmental regulations in foreign countries where the company plans to commence or expand sales may prevent or delay entry into a market or prevent or delay the introduction  or require the reformulation of  certain of the company s products 
in addition  the company cannot predict whether new domestic or foreign legislation regulating its activities will be enacted 
such new legislation could have a material adverse effect on the business  operations and financial condition of the company 
failure to attract and retain management could harm our ability to maintain profitability the company s success is dependent in large part upon its continued ability to identify  hire  retain  and motivate highly skilled management employees 
competition for these employees is intense  and the company may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and on reasonable terms 
the majority of the company s current corporate officers began their employment with the company in fiscal years and the inability of the company to retain competent professional management could adversely effect its ability to execute its business strategy 
centralized location of manufacturing operations the company currently manufactures the vast majority of its products at its manufacturing facilities in southern california 
accordingly  any event resulting in the slowdown or stoppage of the company s manufacturing operations or distribution facilities in southern california could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company maintains business interruption insurance 
there can be no assurance  however  that such insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any losses that may be incurred from an interruption in the company s manufacturing and distribution operations 
concentration of ownership  certain anti takeover considerations the company s directors and executive officers beneficially own in excess of of the outstanding common stock as of june  accordingly  these shareholders will continue to have the ability to substantially influence the management  policies  and business operations of the company 
the company s board of directors has the authority to approve the issuance of  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the company s shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
certain provisions of delaware law  as well as the issuance of preferred stock  and other anti takeover provisions in the company s articles and bylaws  could delay or inhibit the removal of incumbent directors and could delay  defer  make more difficult or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy content  or any change in control involving the company  as well as the removal of management  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the company s shareholders  and may limit the price certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock
