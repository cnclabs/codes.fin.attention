with the exception of the company s revolving credit facility  long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates and denominated in us dollars 
the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in interest rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements 
under the terms of the company s revolving credit facility  a change in either the lender s base rate or libor would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds thereunder

its primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from changes in exchange rates on certain third party trade receivables and payables of the company s swedish subsidiary 
there were no forward purchase or sales contracts outstanding as of december
