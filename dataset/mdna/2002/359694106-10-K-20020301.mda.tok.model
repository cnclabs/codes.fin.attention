item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  management bonus accruals and income tax accounting 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time title passes to the customer 
reductions to revenue are recorded for various customer incentive programs and for sales returns and allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained based on historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual writeoff history 
allowances are also maintained for future sales returns and allowances based on an analysis of recent trends of product returns 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the cost of the inventory 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
pension and other postretirement costs and liabilities are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on assumptions related to the discount rate  projected salary increases and expected return on assets 
the discount rate assumption is tied to long term high quality bond rates 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on recent trends in wage and salary increases 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
the current investment mix in the portfolios is primarily us equities 
the return on asset assumptions are subject to change depending upon the future asset mix in the portfolios 
management incentive plans are tied to various financial performance metrics 
bonus accruals made throughout the year related to the various incentive plans are based on management s best estimate of the achievement of the specific financial metrics 
adjustments to the accruals are made on a quarterly basis as forecasts of financial performance are updated 
at year end  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the actual results achieved 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income

also  the company has no rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt 
management believes that the company has the ability to meet all of its contractual obligations and commitments in the company does not have relationships with any unconsolidated  special purpose entities or financial partnerships  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements

the impact of adopting this accounting standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations

these statements eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and the systematic amortization of goodwill

the company will adopt sfas no 
during the first quarter of under the new standard  purchased goodwill is no longer amortized over its useful life 
therefore  the company will not incur the amortization of goodwill beginning with year amortization of goodwill recorded in was million  which had a negative impact on income per diluted share of per share 
the company is in the process of assessing any transitional impact of adopting sfas no 
euro currency conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between existing local currencies and the euro  the eu s new single currency 
during a transition period from january   through june   the euro will replace the national currencies that exist in the participating countries 
the company converted to the euro as of december  management does not believe the transition to the euro will have a significant effect on consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
outlook certain items will have a material impact on net income 
in a continuing effort to strengthen the organization and remove excess manufacturing capacity  the company announced  on january   a plan to eliminate approximately percent of its current manufacturing capacity 
the plan calls for streamlining its facilities and operations in latin america  europe and in particular  north america 
by reducing the installed capacity and removing other cost structures  management estimates that upon completion  costs will be reduced approximately to million annually 
in connection with the restructuring initiative  the company expects to record special charges in the range of to million before tax  inclusive of the million million after tax incurred in the fourth quarter of for latin america 
cash costs of the plan are expected to be to million 
proceeds from sales of assets affected by the plan however  are expected to offset the cash costs by to million 
the remaining charges are expected to be recorded over the next four quarters and will include severance  accelerated depreciation on assets held and used until disposal and other plan related costs 
the amounts associated with the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are expected to reflect a reduction in income of approximately million in as compared to this equates to approximately 
per share 
these amounts will be reflected in sg a expenses 
the reason for the reduction in income is primarily attributed to the poor performance of the benefit plan asset portfolios during and the decrease in interest rates recorded in currency devaluations in argentina will have a negative impact on the company s first quarter of operating results however  the impact is not expected to exceed per share in the first quarter 
management continually monitors the economic situation in argentina  brazil and other latin american countries and where appropriate  takes action to minimize the company s exposure to future currency devaluations 
safe harbor for forward looking statements certain statements in this document  including those under outlook  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the following political and economic conditions  product demand and industry capacity  competitive products and pricing  manufacturing efficiencies  new product development  product mix  availability and price of raw materials and critical manufacturing equipment  new plant startups  accounts receivable collection  the company s relationships with its major customers and suppliers  changes in tax laws and tariffs  patent rights that could provide significant advantage to a competitor  devaluations and other foreign exchange rate fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  the australian dollar  the argentine peso and the brazilian real  the regulatory and trade environment  and other risks as indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking information represents management s best judgment as of this date based on information currently available that in the future may prove to have been inaccurate 
additionally  the variety of products sold by the company and the regions where the company does business makes it difficult to determine with certainty the increases or decreases in sales resulting from changes in the volume of products sold  currency impact  changes in product mix and selling prices 
however  management s best estimates of these changes as well as changes in other factors have been included 
references to volume changes include volume and product mix changes  combined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities used to fund operations 
the company uses committed floating rate credit facilities to fund a portion of its operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  the company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of the company s net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
the company s principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso and brazilian real 
management s goal is to balance  where possible  the local currency denominated assets to the local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management minimizes the company s risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional details regarding the company s management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results a hypothetical overall percent strengthening of the us dollar would have resulted in a negative income per share impact of approximately per share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used by the company to manufacture its products include resins  polymers and vinyl acetate monomer 
natural raw materials such as starch  dextrines and natural latex are also used in the manufacturing processes 
management attempts to find multiple sources for all of its raw materials 
while alternate sources for most key raw materials are available  if worldwide supplies were disrupted due to unforeseen events  or if unusual demand causes products to be subject to allocation  shortages could occur 
in  the company purchased more than million of raw materials  its single largest expenditure item 
management acknowledges that in the long term  prices of most raw materials will probably increase 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost to the company 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts which limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the company also uses the leverage created by having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible to minimize the impact of possible price increases
