item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s business is managed on a technology product basis  with those technology segments being electronic  optical and other 
the business units whose results are identified in the electronic segment principally employ electronic processes to control and convey signals 
the business units whose results are identified in the optical segment principally employ light to control and convey signals 
the other segment includes a manufacturer of current carrying bus devices  independent laboratories that provide services for qualification testing and certification of electronic and optical components  and  for fiscal and prior  manufacturers of multi layer printed circuit boards 
the company exited the printed circuit business in september as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  a majority of the optical segment was transferred to the company s newly formed subsidiary  stratos lightwave  inc stratos  effective may  on june   stratos issued shares of common stock in an initial public offering after which the company owned of stratos common stock outstanding 
effective as of the close of business on april   the company distributed all of its remaining interest in stratos through a stock dividend to its stockholders of record as of the close of business on april  this distribution was made in the amount of shares of stratos common stock for each share of methode class a and class b common stock 
the company s consolidated financial statements for all periods present stratos as a discontinued operation through the distribution date in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the creditworthiness of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  the company s revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or automotive industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of the company s accounts receivable and the company s future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowances are based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  using assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on may  the company will cease to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill as of may  and an annual impairment review thereafter 
warranties 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of the cost of its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with settling those claims  its warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
restructuring 
the company established restructuring reserves at a number of operations 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  required the use of estimates 
though management believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of the restructuring  actual results may be different 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
contingencies 
the company is subject to various investigations  claims  legal and administrative proceedings  covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify the company s ultimate exposure in these matters 
for those matters that management can estimate a range of loss  the company has established reserves within that range 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assure that the company is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while the company believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  changes in the future could impact these determinations
