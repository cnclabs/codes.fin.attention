we seek organic growth augmented by the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses and routinely review and evaluate our portfolio of existing businesses to determine if they continue to meet our current objectives 
as a result  we are currently engaged in a number of preliminary discussions concerning possible acquisitions  divestitures  joint ventures and related corporate transactions 
we intend to continually explore and conduct discussions with regard to such transactions 
on april   we announced that we had entered into agreements to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of trendwest resorts  inc through a tax free exchange of our cd common stock 
trendwest markets  sells and finances vacation ownership interests 
as part of the planned acquisition  we will assume approximately million of trendwest net debt  which we intend to repay 
the number of shares of cd common stock to be paid to trendwest stockholders will fluctuate between million and million shares  within a collar of to per share of cd common stock 
the first step of the transaction  the purchase of more than of the outstanding shares from certain trendwest stockholders  is expected to close in may  subject to customary regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of closing conditions 
the purchase of the remaining of the outstanding trendwest shares will close upon the effectiveness of a registration statement relating to the issuance of cd common stock to such trendwest stockholders 
on march   we entered into a venture with marriott international  inc whereby we contributed our days inn trademark and an amended license agreement relating to such trademark and marriott contributed the ramada trademark and the master license agreement relating to such trademark 
we received a interest in the venture and marriott received interest in the venture 
pursuant to the terms of the venture  we will share income from the venture with marriott on a substantially equal basis 
we currently expect the venture to redeem marriott s interest for approximately million  the projected fair market value  in march we expect to loan the venture such amount in march to enable the venture to meet its obligations to marriott 
upon redemption  we will own of the venture 
under the terms of the venture agreement  we control the venture and  therefore  will consolidate the venture into our results of operations  financial position and cash flows beginning on march  the venture has no third party liabilities

the consolidated results of operations of the businesses we acquired have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition and the consolidated results of operations of businesses we disposed of have only been included in our consolidated results of operations through their respective dates of disposition 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
certain of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
accordingly  we have reviewed the accounting policies of all our businesses to identify those policies where we are required to make particularly subjective and complex judgments 
the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore  the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
following is a description of those accounting policies which we believe require subjective and complex judgments and could potentially affect reported results 
mortgage servicing rights 
a mortgage servicing right is the right to receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees collected from the mortgagor for performing specified servicing activities 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated based on expected future cash flows considering market prepayment estimates  historical prepayment rates  portfolio characteristics  interest rates and other economic factors 
we estimate future prepayment rates based on current interest rate levels  other economic conditions and market forecasts  as well as relevant characteristics of the servicing portfolio  such as loan types  interest rate stratification and recent prepayment experience 
to the extent that fair value is less than carrying value  we would consider the portfolio to have been impaired and record a related charge 
during  we determined that impairment had occurred due to interest rate reductions  which results in a greater level of mortgage prepayments than expected 
accordingly  we recorded net aggregate write downs of million through a valuation allowance  of which million was directly related to unprecedented interest rate reductions subsequent to the september th terrorist attacks and million was related to changes in estimates in the ordinary course of business 
further reductions in interest rates would have caused us to use different assumptions in the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights resulting in additional corresponding write downs through a valuation allowance 
we use derivatives to mitigate the prepayment risk associated with mortgage servicing rights 
such derivatives tend to increase in value as interest rates decline and conversely decline in value as interest rates increase 
additionally  as interest rates are reduced  we have historically experienced a greater level of refinancings  which partially mitigates the impact of the decline in the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
securitizations 
we sell a significant portion of our residential mortgage loans  relocation receivables and timeshare receivables into securitization entities as part of our financing strategy 
we retain the servicing rights and  in some instances  subordinated residual interests in the mortgage loans and relocation and timeshare receivables 
the investors have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
gains or losses relating to the assets sold are allocated between such assets and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
we estimate fair value of retained interests based upon the present value of expected future cash flows 
the value of the retained interests is subject to the prepayment risks  expected credit losses and interest rate risks of the transferred financial assets 
the effects of any adverse changes in the fair value of our retained interests are detailed in note transfers and servicing of financial assets to the consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments 
we use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage and reduce the interest rate risk primarily related to our mortgage related assets 
effective january   we account for our derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the application of sfas no 
is complex  as evidenced by amendments and significant interpretations to the original standard  which continue to evolve 
most of our derivatives and other financial instruments we use are not exchange traded 
values are determined by reference to dealer price indications  which involve significant judgments and estimates in the absence of quoted market prices 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances  however  the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment involves estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in prepayment levels  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of all our goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing such amounts to their fair values 
we determined that the carrying amounts of all our goodwill and other intangible assets did not exceed their respective fair values 
accordingly  the initial implementation of this standard will not impact earnings during we are required to perform this comparison at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings

included in this charge are the costs of certain actions taken by management in connection with the acquisitions that did not meet the accounting criteria for capitalization 
mortgage servicing rights impairment as previously discussed  during fourth quarter  we determined that an impairment of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio had occurred due to unprecedented interest rate reductions subsequent to the september th terrorist attacks that we deemed not to be in the ordinary course of business 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
litigation settlement and related costs during and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of litigation settlement and related charges net of credits discussed below 
the charges are comprised of million related to the settlement of litigation outside of the principal common stockholder litigation resulting from previously discovered accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc international  inc and million related to investigations into those accounting irregularities

additionally  during fourth quarter  we recorded losses of million in connection with declines in the value of our investments in certain other businesses and million in connection with the dispositions of certain non strategic businesses in the losses related to the dispositions of certain non strategic businesses and were partially offset by the recognition of million of the deferred gain that resulted from the sale of our fleet management business see note dispositions of businesses and impairment of investments 
results of reportable segments vs 
our discussion of each of our segment s operating results focuses on adjusted ebitda  which is defined as earnings before non vehicle interest  income taxes  non vehicle depreciation and amortization  minority interest and equity in homestore 
com  and is adjusted to exclude certain items  which are of a non recurring or unusual nature and are not measured in assessing segment performance or are not segment specific 
our management believes such discussions are the most informative representation of how management evaluates performance 
however  our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 
in connection with the acquisitions of avis and galileo and the disposition of our real estate internet portal  we realigned the operations and management of certain of our businesses during accordingly  our segment reporting structure now encompasses the following five reportable segments real estate services  hospitality  vehicle services  travel distribution and financial services 
the periods presented herein have been reclassified to reflect this change in our segment reporting structure 
revenues adjusted ebitda change a b change real estate services c   hospitality d  vehicle services e  travel distribution f financial services   total reportable segments     corporate and other g total company     not meaningful

such charges were partially offset by a gain of million primarily related to the sale of our real estate internet portal  move

adjusted ebitda for excludes a gain of million  which represents the recognition of a portion of our previously recorded deferred gain from the sale of our former fleet business due to the disposition of vms europe by avis in august such amounts were partially offset by million of losses related to the disposition of certain non strategic businesses and million of net litigation settlement and related costs 
real estate services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating results was primarily driven by substantial growth in mortgage loan production due to increased refinancing activity and purchase volume 
higher franchise fees from our century  coldwell banker and era franchise brands and increases in relocation services also contributed to the favorable operating results 
offsetting the revenue increases  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased million primarily to support the higher volume of mortgage originations and related servicing activities 
collectively  mortgage loans sold increased billion to billion  generating incremental revenues of million  a increase 
closed mortgage loans increased billion to billion in such growth consisted of a billion increase approximately ten fold in refinancings and a billion increase in purchase mortgage closings 
a significant portion of mortgage loans closed in any quarter will generate revenues in future periods as those loans closed are packaged and sold and revenue is recognized upon the sale of the loan  which is typically to days after closing 
beginning in january  merrill lynch outsourced its mortgage origination and servicing operations to us  which accounted for of our mortgage closings in partially offsetting record production revenues was a million decline in net loan servicing revenue 
the average servicing portfolio grew billion resulting from the high volume of mortgage loan originations and our outsourcing arrangement with merrill lynch  however  accelerated servicing amortization expenses during  due primarily to refinancing activity  more than offset the increase in recurring servicing fees from the portfolio growth 
franchise fees from our real estate franchise brands also contributed to revenue and adjusted ebitda growth 
royalties and other franchise fees increased million  despite only modest industry wide growth and a year over year industry decline in california  principally due to a increase in the average price of homes sold and million of other fees received in  including the termination of a franchise agreement 
service based fees from relocation activities also contributed to the increase in revenues and adjusted ebitda principally due to a million increase in referral fees resulting from increased volume  which included the execution of new service contracts 
in addition  asset based relocation revenues decreased by million  which was comprised of a million revenue decline due to lower corporate and government homesale closings  partially offset by a million increase in net interest income from relocation operations due to reduced debt levels in hospitality revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
while our april acquisition of fairfield produced the bulk of this growth  our pre existing timeshare exchange operations also made contributions 
fairfield contributed revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  during in addition  the first quarter acquisition of holiday cottages group limited  the leading uk brand in holiday cottage rentals  contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  in notwithstanding the negative impact that the september th terrorist attacks had on the economy s travel sector  timeshare subscription and transaction fees increased million supported by increases in both members and exchange transactions 
a corresponding increase in timeshare related staffing costs was incurred to support volume growth and meet anticipated service levels 
revenues and adjusted ebitda in this segment include a decline in preferred alliance fees of million  principally due to the expiration of a vendor contract in royalties and marketing fund revenues from our lodging franchise operations declined million and million  respectively  due to a decrease in revenue per available room 
lower marketing fund revenues received from franchisees were directly offset by lower expenses incurred on the marketing of our nine lodging brands 
the september th terrorist attacks caused a decline in the occupancy levels and room rates of our franchised lodging properties in the fourth quarter of while we expect the events of september th to suppress the growth of this segment in the near term  we also expect that the percentage impact will continue to decline over time  absent any further negative events affecting the travel industry 
furthermore  since many of our timeshare operations and franchised lodging properties principally serve road travelers rather than air travelers  we believe that the effects of september th on this segment s operations will be less severe than on the travel industry as a whole 
vehicle services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased billion and million  respectively  substantially due to the acquisition of avis in march prior to the acquisition of avis  revenues and adjusted ebitda of this segment consisted principally of earnings from our equity investment in avis  franchise royalties received from avis and the operations of our national car parks subsidiary 
the acquisition of avis contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of billion and million  respectively  in avis results in were negatively impacted by reduced demand at airport locations due to a general decline in commercial travel throughout the year  which was further exacerbated by the september th terrorist attacks 
in response to the slowdown in commercial travel and in the wake of the september th terrorist attacks  we believe that we have rightsized our car rental operations to meet anticipated business levels  which included reductions in workforce and fleet fleet was downsized by approximately 
we expect that seasonally adjusted car rental volumes will continue to increase as air travel volumes rebound 
our fleet management  fuel card management and uk parking businesses were not materially impacted by the september th terrorist attacks 
the remaining segment results reflect the operations of our national car parks subsidiary  which had lower income due to a reduction in property disposals 
travel distribution prior to the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets  revenue and adjusted ebitda for this segment principally comprised the operations of cendant travel  our travel agent subsidiary 
galileo and cheap tickets contributed revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively 
the september th terrorist attacks caused a decline in demand for travel related services and  accordingly  reduced the booking volumes for galileo and our travel agency businesses below fourth quarter levels 
galileo worldwide booking volume for air travel declined in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter and other travel related bookings car  hotel  etc 
were down for the comparable periods 
upon completing the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets  in response to the existing economic conditions  we not only moved aggressively to integrate these businesses and achieve expected synergies  but we also re examined their cost structures and streamlined their operations through workforce reductions and other means to meet expected business volumes 
absent any further shock to the travel industry  we expect travel volumes to continue to improve over time 
financial services revenues increased million while adjusted ebitda decreased million 
while the royalties we will receive from trilegiant will benefit segment results in future periods  the outsourcing of our individual membership business to trilegiant caused a decrease in adjusted ebitda during  largely due to million of transaction related expenses and million of marketing spending by trilegiant  which we were contractually required to fund and  as such  expensed see discussion in liquidity and capital resources trilegiant corporation 
excluding these items  adjusted ebitda increased million 
membership volumes and revenues declined  however  commissions increased due to higher commission rates 
conversely  the cost savings from servicing fewer members  as well as trilegiant s absorption of its share of fixed overhead expenses subsequent to the outsourcing  more than offset the lower membership revenues and higher commissions 
in addition  we acquired netmarket  an online membership business  during fourth quarter  which was immediately integrated into our existing membership business 
netmarket contributed incremental revenues of million in jackson hewitt  our tax preparation franchise business  contributed incremental revenues of million  principally comprised of higher royalties due to a increase in tax return volume  with relatively no corresponding increases in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
revenues and adjusted ebitda in included million of fees recognized from the sale of certain referral agreements 
corporate and other revenues decreased million while adjusted ebitda increased million 
our real estate internet portal and certain ancillary businesses  which were sold to homestore in february  collectively accounted for a decline in revenues of million and an improvement to adjusted ebitda of million because we were investing in the development and marketing of the portal during revenues and adjusted ebitda were negatively impacted by million less income from financial investments 
in addition  revenues recognized from providing electronic reservation processing services to avis ceased coincident with our acquisition of avis  contributing to a reduction in revenues of million with no adjusted ebitda impact since avis had been billed for such services at cost 
in december  we entered into a ten year  information technology services relationship with ibm whereby ibm will manage all of our data center operations 
adjusted ebitda in benefited from the absence of million of costs incurred in to pursue internet initiatives and also reflects increased unallocated corporate overhead costs principally due to infrastructure expansion to support company growth 
results of consolidated operations vs 
our consolidated results from continuing operations comprised the following change net revenues    expenses  excluding other charges and non vehicle interest  net    other charges   non vehicle interest  net total expenses    net loss gain on dispositions of businesses and impairment of investments   income loss before income taxes and minority interest   provision benefit for income taxes minority interest  net of tax income loss from continuing operations net revenues decreased primarily as a result of the impact of businesses we disposed of during primarily our former fleet management and entertainment publications businesses  as well as growth attributable to higher relocation service based fees  increased mortgage production and loan servicing revenues and greater royalty fees generated from our real estate franchised brands 
a detailed discussion of revenue trends is included in results of reportable segments vs 
total expenses decreased primarily due to other charges discussed below  as well as the impact of businesses we disposed of during and a decrease in net non vehicle interest expense primarily resulting from a decrease in our average debt balance outstanding  which was partially offset by interest expense accrued on our stockholder litigation settlement liability during our provision for income taxes was million in  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a benefit of million in  or an effective tax rate of

a detailed discussion of the unusual charges is included in results of consolidated operations vs 
the charge primarily consisted of i million incurred in connection with the creation of netmarket group  inc  a then independent company that was created to pursue the development and expansion of interactive businesses  ii million primarily related to an irrevocable contribution to an independent technology trust responsible for completing the transition of our lodging franchisees to a common property management system and iii million primarily related to the termination of a proposed acquisition

adjusted ebitda for excludes charges of i  million primarily related to the settlement of the principal common stockholder class action lawsuit and ii million related to the termination of a proposed acquisition 
such charges were partially offset by a net gain of million related to the dispositions of businesses 
real estate services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating results was principally due to increased royalties from our real estate franchise brands and growth in service based fees generated from client relocations 
royalty fees for the century registered trademark  coldwell banker registered trademark  and era registered trademark franchise brands collectively increased million resulting from an increase in the average price of homes sold net of a reduction in the volume of homes sold 
increases in royalties and franchise fees are recognized with minimal corresponding increases in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
service based fees from relocation related operations also significantly contributed to the increase in revenues and adjusted ebitda 
service based relocation fees increased million and are reflective of increased penetration into both destination and departure markets and expanded services provided to our clients 
revenues from mortgage loans closed increased million as the impact of favorable production margins exceeded the effect of a reduction in mortgage loan closings 
the average production fee increased basis points due to a reduction in the direct costs per loan 
mortgage loan closings declined billion to billion  consisting of billion in purchase mortgages and billion in refinancing mortgages 
the decline in loan closings was primarily the result of a billion reduction in mortgage refinancings due to the continued high volume of industry wide refinancing activity in lower loan origination volume during the first half of contributed to a reduction in the adjusted ebitda margin in purchase mortgage closings in our retail lending business where we interact directly with the consumer increased billion to billion 
retail mortgage lending has been our primary focus and accounted for more than of loan volume in loan servicing revenues in included an million gain on the sale of servicing rights 
excluding such gain  recurring loan servicing revenue increased million 
the increase in loan servicing revenue was principally attributable to a corresponding increase in the average servicing portfolio  which grew approximately billion 
the aforementioned increases in our core business operations were partially offset by a reduction of million in gains recognized from the sale of portions of our preferred stock investments in nrt incorporated  a million gain recognized in on the sale of a minority interest in an insurance subsidiary  an million gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights and a million increase in corporate overhead allocations due to a refinement of allocation methods used in excluding the aforementioned gains on asset sales and increase in corporate overhead allocations  revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  and the adjusted ebitda margin remained constant at 
hospitality revenues remained relatively constant while adjusted ebitda decreased million  or 
however  the primary drivers impacting our franchise and timeshare operations reflected growth

recently issued accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in its entirety 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this standard eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will be required to assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we have reassessed the useful lives assigned to our intangible assets acquired in transactions consummated prior to july  and the related amortization methodology 
accordingly  we identified those intangible assets that have indefinite lives  adjusted the future amortization periods of certain intangible assets appropriately and changed our amortization methodology where appropriate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we did not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired after june  as of january   we discontinued the amortization of all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
based upon a preliminary assessment  we expect that the increase in pre tax net income from the application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
would have approximated million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as previously described  the initial implementation of this standard will not impact our results of operations during impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and replaces the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  as it relates to the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
requires the use of a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  by requiring those long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the impairment recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
were retained for all long lived assets to be held and used with the exception of goodwill 
we adopted this standard on january  forward looking statements forward looking statements in our public filings or other public statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements were based on various factors and were derived utilizing numerous important assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include the information concerning our future financial performance  business strategy  projected plans and objectives 
statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  project  estimates  plans  may increase  may fluctuate and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  may and could are generally forward looking in nature and not historical facts 
you should understand that the following important factors and assumptions could affect our future results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements the impacts of the september  terrorist attacks on new york city and washington  dc on the travel industry in general  and our travel businesses in particular  are not fully known at this time  but are expected to include negative impacts on financial results due to reduced demand for travel in the near term  other attacks  acts of war  or measures taken by governments in response thereto may negatively affect the travel industry  our financial results and could also result in a disruption in our business  the effect of economic conditions and interest rate changes on the economy on a national  regional or international basis and the impact thereof on our businesses  the effects of a decline in travel  due to political instability  adverse economic conditions or otherwise  on our travel related businesses  the effects of changes in current interest rates  particularly on our real estate franchise and mortgage businesses  the resolution or outcome of our unresolved pending litigation relating to the previously announced accounting irregularities and other related litigation  our ability to develop and implement operational  technological and financial systems to manage growing operations and to achieve enhanced earnings or effect cost savings  competition in our existing and potential future lines of business and the financial resources of  and products available to  competitors  failure to reduce quickly our substantial technology costs in response to a reduction in revenue  particularly in our computer reservations and global distribution systems businesses  our failure to provide fully integrated disaster recovery technology solutions in the event of a disaster  our ability to integrate and operate successfully acquired and merged businesses and risks associated with such businesses  including the acquisitions of galileo international  inc and cheap tickets  inc  the compatibility of the operating systems of the combining companies  and the degree to which our existing administrative and back office functions and costs and those of the acquired companies are complementary or redundant  our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance our growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings  competitive and pricing pressures in the vacation ownership and travel industries  including the car rental industry  changes in the vehicle manufacturer repurchase arrangements in our avis car rental business in the event that used vehicle values decrease  and changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards and privacy policy regulation 
other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the derivation of these forward looking statements  and the failure of such other assumptions to be realized as well as other factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control 
you should consider the areas of risk described above in connection with any forward looking statements that may be made by us and our businesses generally 
except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements  to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events unless required by law 
for any forward looking statements contained in any document  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  forward delivery commitments and futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities  debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and forecasted foreign currency denominated acquisitions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making  or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage related assets and commitments and also libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that such interest rates will remain a primary market exposure for the foreseeable future 
our primary foreign currency rate exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations in the british pound sterling 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a primary market exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of relocation receivables  timeshare receivables  equity advances on homes  mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities and our retained interests in securitized assets 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates  and discount rates 
in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities  the models also utilize credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  forward delivery contracts and options  we rely on prices sourced from bloomberg in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
we also utilize an option adjusted spread oas model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumption in an oas model is the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions used in determining fair value 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december   and our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis permitted  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
