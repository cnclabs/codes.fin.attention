item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during  the company experienced strong growth  primarily as a result of continued implementation of its strategic plan 
the company further expanded its managed care business while strengthening its scientific expertise and market share through acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
the company completed two important acquisitions during the current year 
path lab holdings  inc  acquired in may  is the largest regional laboratory in new england with annual revenues in of approximately million 
this acquisition not only expanded the company s geographic coverage  but also helped leverage the company s expertise in esoteric testing 
path lab has particular skill in servicing hospitals in the new england market 
hospitals generally have a need for higher value esoteric testing 
the acquisition of minneapolis based viro med inc in june  further strengthened the company s leadership position in infectious disease testing 
in addition  viro med s specialized laboratory space provides significant additional esoteric testing capacity and the flexibility to more efficiently direct testing workflow throughout the country 
viro med had clinical laboratory revenues for the twelve months ended december  of approximately million 
in december  the company entered into exclusive licensing and marketing relationships with exact sciences and myriad genetics 
under the agreement with exact sciences  the company will be the only national clinical laboratory to offer testing services based on certain of exact sciences proprietary technologies for the detection of colorectal cancer 
the agreement with myriad genetics allows the company to market myriad s predictive medicine markers for hypertension  melanoma  breast  ovarian and colorectal cancers to the company s more than  primary care physicians 
while the company believes both of these agreements will have a favorable impact on its operating results going forward  it is too early in each relationship to reliably quantify their impact in in addition to the acquisitions and relationships discussed above  the company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors the expansion of higher value genomic tests such as cystic fibrosis  hcv and hiv genotyping is occurring  along with the continued growth of hiv viral loads and hpv testing  continued conversion of traditional pap smears to the newer  high value monolayer technology  additional product licensing and business relationships such as myriad genetics and exact sciences  the company s ongoing business acquisition strategy  growing demand for genomic testing will create a positive shift in test mix to higher value testing  and improving regulatory and reimbursement environment in washington

it is anticipated that the offering of these shares will be consummated sometime during march subject to prevailing market conditions 
the sale by roche of these shares will reduce their ownership interest in the company s common stock to if the overallotment option is exercised in full compared to as of december  seasonality volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  amortization lives for intangible assets and accruals for self insurance reserves 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical collection trends  the aging of accounts  current economic conditions and regulatory changes 
the deferred tax valuation allowance brings the company s net deferred tax assets to a level where management believes that it is more likely than not the tax benefits will be realized 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited  generally ranging from to years for goodwill  legal life for patents and technology  to years for customer lists and contractual lives for non compete agreements 
management periodically reviews the company s operating and financial performance in order to determine whether it should revise its estimates of the useful lives or whether circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the company s goodwill or other long lived assets may not be recoverable 
accruals for self insurance reserves including workers compensation  auto  employee medical and professional liability are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history  along with current and estimated future economic conditions 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are  by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates
