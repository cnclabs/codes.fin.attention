item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s two most significant components of revenue  which accounted for and of revenue in fiscal were generated  respectively  through its ground support equipment subsidiary  global ground support  llc global  and its air cargo subsidiaries  mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa 
global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment on a worldwide basis 
global s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the small decrease in revenues in was primarily due to decreased commercial equipment orders being virtually offset by a large scale airport deicer contract  which commenced in february mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
separate agreements cover the three types of aircraft operated by mac and csa cessna caravan  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from a major air express company customer  and short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with the customer 
pursuant to such agreements  the customer determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the customer at any time upon to days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with the customer are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
the company is not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and has done so in the past 
loss of its contracts with the customer would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mountain aircraft services  llc s mas aircraft component parts brokerage and repair services contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and are included in aircraft services and other in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 
the company s four subsidiaries operate in three business segments 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the subsidiaries have been combined into the following reportable segments air cargo  aviation ground equipment and aviation services in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s expenses as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands    expense as a percentage of revenue flight operations maintenance and brokerage ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation  retirement benefit obligations  valuation of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method and valuation of long lived assets 
following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are based on assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
historical part usage and estimated future demand provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the aviation industry 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance  if any  reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
company judgement of the recoverability of these assets is based primarily on estimates of current and expected future earnings and tax planning 
retirement benefits obligation 
the company determines the value of retirement benefits assets and liabilities on an actuarial basis 
values are affected by our outside actuary s estimates of the expected return on plan assets  insurance policies and the discount rates used 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used will affect the amount of pension gain or loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and title has passed to customers 
revenues from overhaul contracts on customer owned parts and long term fixed price manufacturing projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenues for contracts under percentage of completion are measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date  to estimated total cost for each contract or workorder 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets on april  if required  the company will record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
in the event it is determined that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of estimated gross future cash flows for those assets  the company then will write down the value of the assets to a level commensurate with their fair value using a discounted cash flow approach 
seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts  started in fiscal  to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force usaf for a total amount of approximately million  and in january global received a million pedestal mounted deicer contract with the philadelphia international airport  expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that revenue from the usaf contract will continue to contribute to management s plan to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues 
the company believes that this seasonal trend was not reflected in global s current third quarter results due to the september  terrorist attacks and weakening aviation market discussed below 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal

on may  the company expanded its bank financing line to a  credit facility 
under the terms of the agreement  a  secured long term revolving credit line which expires on august  replaced the company s  unsecured short term revolving credit line 
the remaining  of the credit facility is a five year term loan which matures on may   with quarterly payments of  plus accrued interest 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
amounts advanced under the credit facility bear interest at the day libor rate plus basis points 
the libor rate at march  was 
at march  and  the amounts outstanding against the credit facility were  and  respectively 
at march    was available under the entire credit facility 
the company has classified  of its outstanding balance on the credit facility as of march  as long term to reflect the terms included under the agreement signed on may  the company entered into two swap agreements on may  to fix the interest rate on the  term portion and  of the revolving portion of the credit facility at respective interest rates of and the following table of material debt and lease commitments at march  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods 
related cash outflows contractual obligations total long term bank debt       operating leases       capital leases      total       the respective years ended march   and resulted in the following changes in cash flow operating activities provided  and  respectively in and and used  in investing activities used   and  respectively  in  and and financing activities used  and  respectively  in and and provided  in net cash decreased   and  respectively  in  and cash provided by operating activities was  more for the year ended march   compared to principally due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable

the company paid a per share cash dividend in june and declared a per share cash dividend on may   to be paid on june  to shareholders of record dated june  deferred retirement obligation the company s former chairman and chief executive officer passed away on april  the death benefits are payable in the amount of  per year for years 
impact of inflation the company believes the impact of inflation and changing prices on its revenues and net earnings will not have a material effect on its manufacturing operations because increased costs due to inflation could be passed on to its customers  or on its air cargo business since the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup  under current contract terms 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has approved sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no

it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and amends  accounting principles bulletin apb no 
along with establishing a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no

or to have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
derivative financial instruments on april   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into two interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  and million respectively 
these agreements were entered into as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rates on the million term portion and million of the revolving portion of the credit facility at interest rates of and  respectively  the maturity dates of the swaps vested the respective maturity dates of the underlying debt instruments 
the fair value of these swaps had decreased by  at march  because the swaps are considered completely effective the change in fair market value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive loss and long term debt on the balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
on may  the company entered into swap agreements to fix the interest rates on the million term portion and million of the revolving portion of its credit facility at respective interest rates of and to reduce its exposure to the fluctuations of libor based variable interest rates 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on certain portions of its line of credit  which bears interest based on the day libor rate plus basis points 
if the libor interest rate had been increased by one percentage point  based on the year end balance of the line of credit  annual interest expense would have increased by approximately
