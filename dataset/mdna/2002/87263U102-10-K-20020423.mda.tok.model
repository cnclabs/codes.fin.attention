item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in many cases  you can identify forward looking statements by the use of words such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
our actual results could be materially different from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
overview t r systems was founded in as an engineering services company providing consulting services to the printing  copying and multimedia markets 
in  we began development of our own products and in  we introduced the micropress  our digital document production management system 
since  we have continually improved the micropress by adding software functionality and device connectivity 
historically  we have derived our revenue primarily from the sale of imaging systems and related add on software and hardware for the management  distribution and production of digital documents 
additionally  we receive or have received revenue from engineering services for the development of technology  the sale of consumable products  such as toner  and replacement parts that support our systems  customer service plans  fees for other customer services  such as training and product related consulting  and royalties for previously licensed technology 
we distribute our products in north america and internationally through distribution relationships with hitachi  ikon  kyocera mita  lanier  mgi  minolta  ricoh and toshiba  as well as through a network of independent dealers 
we first sold products under the oem agreements with hitachi and minolta in fiscal we began selling products under our oem agreements with ikon  ricoh and toshiba in fiscal we began selling products under our oem agreements with lanier and mgi in fiscal additionally  we have entered into a development agreement with canon and anticipate that canon will begin distributing our products late in the first quarter of fiscal also  during the fiscal year ended january   we entered into an agreement with xerox under which xerox has a non exclusive right to distribute m estro worldwide 
we also entered into an agreement with oce for the development of connectivity of an oce print device with the micropress 
in  we signed an oem agreement with mita industrial co  ltd 
allowing mita to resell the micropress in japan 
in august  we amended that agreement with its successor company  kyocera mita  and began shipping products to kyocera mita in october sales shipped internationally were million  or of revenue  in fiscal we expect that sales shipped internationally will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
currently  substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive  which could result in a reduction in our sales in a particular country 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
imaging systems revenue is recognized based on the guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from imaging systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the system has been shipped  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
under multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
revenue from products requiring significant customization in order to meet the customer s objectives  such as our digital storefront application  is recognized upon completion of the required customization 
we recognize engineering service fees for development of technology typically related to the development of a connection between an oem reseller s print device and our products 
engineering service fees typically consist of a combination of cash payments and print devices or other equipment related to the development project  given to us by the oem resellers in lieu of additional cash payments 
the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the total of the market value of the print devices and other equipment and cash received 
engineering service fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the hours of work done on a project as a percent of the total estimated hours required to complete the project  which necessarily involves subjective judgment and may result in fluctuations in quarterly results 
revenue from the sale of printing consumables is recognized upon shipment 
revenue from customer service plans is recognized ratably over the term of each plan  which is typically one to three years 
nonrefundable prepaid royalties are recognized as revenue over the term of the royalty agreement based on the greater of actual royalties earned or the straight line method 
revenue from royalties  which is included in service revenue  has been less than of total revenue in each of our last three fiscal years 
research and development costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is determined 
to date  we have expensed all software development costs as incurred due to the immaterial amount of costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and the time that the software is generally available for sale 
inventory inventory valuation reserves 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
we provide for inventory obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand for our products  market conditions and estimates of product life cycles 
if future demand or market conditions are worse or product life cycles are shorter than we estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes 
t r systems records deferred tax assets as a result of net operating losses  differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes versus their basis for income tax purposes  tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options subsequent to our public offering  and other tax benefits 
after consultation with our independent accountants  we determine whether or not to establish a valuation allowance as an offset to our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established when it is not likely that some or all of the tax asset balances will be realized within the foreseeable future 
we consider principally our recent operating results in conjunction with other available evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
before the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had established and maintained a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our history of profitability in the previous twelve quarters  combined with our then estimated future profitability  was considered by us to be persuasive evidence that the valuation allowance was not necessary 
therefore  we reversed the entire allowance and recorded a million deferred income tax benefit in our results of operations 
however  due principally to the significant losses in fiscal  and in the absence of other persuasive evidence  we reestablished a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal at january   we had approximately million in federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future income taxes payables  which  if not utilized  expire beginning in we expect that we will maintain our valuation allowance against our entire deferred tax asset throughout fiscal although we will review the valuation allowance each quarter 
consolidated results of operations the following table presents our consolidated operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
fiscal year ended january  imaging systems services total revenue operating expenses cost of imaging systems research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended january   and total revenue 
revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in revenue of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal was due to a decrease in imaging systems revenue 
the increase in fiscal revenue over fiscal revenue of million  or  was due primarily to an increase in imaging systems revenue 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in engineering services revenue 
imaging systems revenue is derived from the shipment of digital document management and production systems  as well as software  hardware and consumables related to those systems 
our imaging systems revenue decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was the result of decreased orders from our oem resellers as well as our independent resellers 
the increase in imaging systems revenue from fiscal to fiscal of million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was due to shipments of products under our new oem reseller relationships in fiscal during fiscal  we shipped products to ikon  ricoh and toshiba in addition to hitachi and minolta  both of which also purchased products in fiscal we recognize services revenue primarily from engineering service fees  customer service plans  training and product related consulting 
additionally  included in services revenue in fiscal was revenue from royalties for licensed technology 
during fiscal  services revenue increased  to million  due to an increase in engineering service fees for developing interfaces with additional print devices of new and existing oem resellers to the micropress 
the increase in engineering service fees of  was partially offset by decreases in other services revenue 
services revenue increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in engineering service fees 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increases in revenue from customer service plans and maintenance agreements with our oem resellers 
during fiscal  we derived million  or  of our total revenue from sales shipped internationally 
this compares to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal revenue from sales shipped internationally decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to a decrease in shipments to canada and europe 
revenue from sales shipped internationally increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of increased international sales through our oem reseller relationships 
however  revenue from sales shipped internationally as a percent of total revenue decreased as domestic revenue grew at a faster rate than international revenue in fiscal due to greater focus on the domestic market both by our oem resellers and us through our independent resellers  as well as our more established domestic distribution infrastructure 
revenue from sales shipped internationally was derived from sales in asia  europe and canada in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal revenue from sales to asia represented of total revenue 
no other region represented more than of revenue in any of the three fiscal years 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million  or of total revenue  in fiscal  as compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal as a result of our decreased revenue and the continued global economic weakness in fiscal  we reduced our number of employees by people  or  from august  to january  the overall reduction was achieved through workforce reductions in august and november along with other attrition 
the cost reductions will not be fully reflected in our operating results until the first quarter of fiscal we anticipate that our operating expenses will be lower than the same period of last fiscal year at least for the first half of fiscal as a result of these headcount reductions and other cost saving measures 
cost of imaging systems 
cost of imaging systems consists primarily of third party hardware  principally servers  print devices  board components  finished boards and consumables  and third party software  as well as labor and overhead 
cost of imaging systems was million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal as compared to million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal and million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal the increase as a percent of imaging systems revenue in fiscal over fiscal was due to the following during fiscal  we recorded non recurring charges of million in cost of imaging systems for the write down of print devices and other hardware components in inventory to their net realizable value  as compared to  during fiscal the labor and overhead components of cost of imaging systems increased as a percentage of imaging systems revenue primarily due to a decrease in imaging systems revenue  and imaging systems revenue from sales to our oem resellers decreased as a percentage of total imaging systems revenue 
systems sold to our oem resellers have lower levels of hardware content  and thus carry a lower cost of sales  than systems sold to our independent resellers 
cost of imaging systems as a percent of imaging systems revenue decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in oem imaging systems revenue as a percent of total imaging systems revenue 
the impact of the increase in oem revenue as a percent of total revenue in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in the cost of imaging systems as a percent of imaging systems revenue sold through our independent resellers  as well as an increase in labor and overhead in our product assembly operations 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  equipment depreciation  software and hardware supplies used in product development and an allocation of overhead 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses represented of total revenue in fiscal  of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal research and development expenses increased approximately million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  due in part to an increase in personnel related expenses of  resulting from the hiring of additional research and development personnel during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal to assist in the further development of our products 
also contributing to the increase was an increase of  in depreciation expense and  in certain project related expenses  due primarily to the addition of equipment for the development and testing of connectivity of new print devices to our products 
research and development expenses increased million from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses as a result of hiring additional research and development personnel to assist in the development of the new series of the micropress  as well as the development of new products  such as m estro 
the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of  on print devices used to develop connectivity with the micropress 
we believe that research and development spending will decrease in the near term as a result of cost saving measures taken in the second half of fiscal  including reductions in headcount 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  sales commissions  trade show costs  advertising  technical support and travel related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  or of total revenue 
these expenses were million  or of total revenue in fiscal  and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of  as a result of the hiring of additional sales and technical support personnel during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal to support the anticipated growth of our business 
additionally  depreciation and other facilities related expenses increased by  primarily due to the expansion of our training and product demonstration facilities during the second half of fiscal to support the expected growth in our business 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of million as a result of increases in our sales force  as well as increases in our support and training personnel 
the remaining increase in fiscal was due to increases in trade show expenses  facilities related expenses and outside services 
we believe that spending on sales and marketing will decrease in the near term as a result of cost saving measures taken in the second half of fiscal  including reductions in headcount 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include employee salaries and benefits  professional service fees and employee recruiting expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal of  or  was due to an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts 
during fiscal  we incurred expenses of  due to an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts due to our concerns about the ultimate collectibility of sales to certain of our independent resellers 
the provision for doubtful accounts was  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expense of  or  from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increases in expenses related to being a publicly traded company of  and increases in salaries and benefits expenses of  we believe that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term as a result of cost saving measures taken in the second half of fiscal  including reductions in headcount 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal was due to a decrease in cash available for short term investments during the year  as we used cash to fund our operations and capital expenditures  and to a drop in interest rates from the prior year 
the increase in interest income in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase in the funds available for short term investments as a result of our initial public offering 
upon completion of our initial public offering in january  we received million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
income tax expense benefit 
in fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million  resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance for the balance of our deferred tax assets at january  of million net of tax benefits recorded at our effective tax rate as a result of losses during fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a million benefit for income taxes  which included the recognition of million in deferred income tax assets offset by a  current provision for alternative minimum income taxes 
the deferred income tax benefit represents the remainder of our net operating losses for income taxes and other deferred income tax assets  which had previously been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded a current provision for alternative minimum income taxes of  net income loss and net income loss per share 
we recorded a net loss of million in fiscal versus net income of million in fiscal and  in fiscal we recognized a diluted loss per share of per share in fiscal as compared to diluted earnings per share of per share in fiscal and per share in fiscal as discussed above  the fiscal net loss and the fiscal net income included significant non recurring tax adjustments and the fiscal net income only included alternative minimum income taxes 
the following table calculates pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share by applying a tax rate of to actual income loss before income tax expense benefit in order to compare earnings for the three fiscal years excluding the impact of the tax adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal the tax rate of is an estimate of our fully taxed effective tax rate 
these pro forma numbers are not intended to be indicative of future operating results 
fiscal year ended january  pro forma information income loss before income tax expense benefit   pro forma income tax expense benefit   pro forma net income loss   pro forma net income loss per common share diluted weighted average shares outstanding diluted    liquidity and capital resources from inception  we have funded our operations and investments in property and equipment primarily through the sale of equity securities 
in january  we completed our initial public offering and received million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
prior to our initial public offering  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of preferred stock totaling about million 
we also obtained additional funding through the private placement of our common stock primarily with our founders  other employees and private investors 
prior to our initial public offering  we received million through the sale of common stock 
during fiscal and fiscal  we received  from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans 
we had no other sales of stock during fiscal or fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million and net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was the result of the net loss of million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was the result of million of net income recorded in fiscal  offset by increases in receivables and inventories as a result of the increase in our sales and cost of imaging systems during fiscal net cash used in operating activities increased in fiscal as a result of increases in receivables and inventories 
net cash used for investing activities was million is fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting purchases of property and equipment 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of fiscal spending on leasehold improvements and equipment for a newly leased operations and training center in norcross  georgia  and for the expansion of office space in our main office building 
the remaining decrease was the result of the curtailment of purchases of property and equipment in fiscal due in part to the decrease in our number of employees 
in addition to our purchases of property and equipment in fiscal  we capitalized million in print devices received from our oem resellers for partial payment of engineering service fees 
we capitalized  worth of such equipment in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue spending on capital expenditures consistent with our growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel  although we have no plans for significant expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities in the current fiscal year 
we have a million secured revolving line of credit from a bank  which expires on october  there were no borrowings against this line of credit at january  or all borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at prime plus and are secured by our assets 
the line of credit requires the maintenance of various covenants  including a restriction on paying dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants at january  the agreement also provides for up to  in letters of credit 
any letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the line 
in april  we issued a  letter of credit under this facility in connection with an operating lease obligation 
this letter of credit is reduced annually by at january   we had an unused  letter of credit from a bank under an additional credit facility 
both the letter of credit and that additional credit facility expired on january  as security for the letter of credit  we were required to maintain a certificate of deposit for  the certificate of deposit was classified as restricted cash at january  net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal represented the proceeds from sales of common stock through our employee stock plans as well as a decrease in restricted cash used to secure a letter of credit  which expired in fiscal the net cash used in fiscal was the result of the settlement of a bank overdraft outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year along with the payment of additional costs from our initial public offering in fiscal these uses of cash in fiscal were offset by the proceeds from the sales of our common stock through our employee stock plans 
fiscal financing activities include our initial public offering  as well as the private placement of  shares of series d preferred stock at per share in may we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion for the foreseeable future 
however  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements or if we determine to acquire any technology  we may be required to raise additional funds  through either debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
inflation has had no material impact on our operations to date 
t r systems  inc has two wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  t r systems canada inc and t r systems holland bv  which we maintain for regulatory and tax compliance in foreign jurisdictions 
the results of operations  cash flows and balance sheets of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements and all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation 
we have no other subsidiaries which are not consolidated  nor do we have any structured finance or other special purpose entities 
additionally  we did not enter into any significant off balance sheet arrangements or transactions during any of the fiscal years discussed herein

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe our exposure to market rate fluctuations on our cash equivalents is minor due to the short term maturities of those investments  typically days or less 
we have market risk relating to borrowings under our credit facility because the interest rates under the facility are variable 
however  as of january   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure or any other exposures 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales shipped internationally 
currently  substantially all of our sales shipped internationally are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive  which could result in a reduction in our sales in a particular country
