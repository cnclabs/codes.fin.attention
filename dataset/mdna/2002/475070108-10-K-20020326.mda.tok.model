item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations jefferson pilot corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   analyzes the results of operations  consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of jefferson pilot corporation and consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
all dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts 
all references to notes are to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
prior share amounts and earnings per share have been restated to give retroactive effect to the company s stock dividend  which was effective in april company profile we have five reportable segments individual products  annuity and investment products aip  benefit partners  communications  and corporate and other 
within our individual products segment  we offer a wide array of individual life insurance products including variable life insurance 
aip offers both fixed and variable annuities  as well as other investment products marketed through jefferson pilot securities corporation  a registered broker dealer with related entities  jpsc 
benefit partners offers group non medical products such as term life  disability and dental insurance to the employer marketplace 
we market these insurance and investment products to individuals and businesses in the united states 
at december   our principal life insurance subsidiaries were jefferson pilot life insurance company jp life  and jefferson pilot financial insurance company jpfic and its subsidiary jefferson pilot lifeamerica insurance company jpla collectively jp financial 
our subsidiary  jefferson pilot communications company jpcc  and its subsidiaries conduct communications operations consisting of radio and television broadcasting operations located in strategically selected markets in the southeastern and western united states  and sports program production 
corporate and other contains the activities of the parent company and passive investment affiliates  surplus of the life insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other reportable segments  financing expenses on corporate debt  strategic initiatives designed to benefit the entire company  and federal and state income taxes not otherwise allocated to business segments 
we include realized gains and losses on investments in the corporate segment 
we have expanded through acquisitions in prior years 
our most recent acquisition was guarantee life insurance company guarantee which we acquired in late our acquisition strategy is designed to enhance core business growth and deploy excess capital 
the focus is to increase distribution  add products  add technology and provide economies of scale 
excluding realized gains and losses  our revenues were derived from individual products  from aip  from benefit partners  from communications  and from corporate and other 
as a result of strategic studies in  we adopted a refined marketing strategy called premier partnering 
strategic initiatives include a higher level of marketing support and improved service for more productive agents  tailoring specific products and marketing programs  and implementation of lean manufacturing to improve quality and reliability throughout our marketing and service processes 
we are experiencing growth in life sales and an increase in the number of agents who qualify as premier partners as a result of acceptance in the marketplace of this strategy 
critical accounting policies we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require that we apply significant judgment  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those accounting policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions in the determination of certain estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs dac and value of business acquired voba reflect our expectations about the future experience of the business in force 
some of the assumptions regarding future experience that can affect the carrying value of dac and voba balances include mortality  interest spreads and policy lapse rates 
significant changes in these assumptions can impact the carrying balance of dac and voba and therefore  produce changes which must be reflected in earnings 
see financial position  capital resources and liquidity for further discussion of these items including a sensitivity analysis 
we have amortized goodwill  representing the cost of prior acquisitions over the value of the net assets received  through in a systematic fashion over periods ranging from to years 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard which eliminates systematic amortization of goodwill and requires that we test the remaining balance for impairment on at least an annual basis 
as part of the adoption of the new accounting standard  we must use judgment in both the allocation of goodwill to our reporting units and the calculation of their fair value 
based upon our preliminary estimates  we do not expect to recognize a significant impairment as we adopt this new standard 
our investments in debt securities include both publicly traded and privately placed securities 
we obtain values for actively traded securities from established external pricing services 
for infrequently traded securities and private placements  we utilize an internal pricing model 
this model requires us to make judgments related to the security s credit quality  liquidity and credit spread 
we evaluate securities that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
to do this we evaluate the probability of collecting scheduled payments  and we monitor other external factors that could affect the security s issuer such as litigation  bankruptcy proceedings or regulatory changes 
we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types  some of which include claims for punitive damages 
in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages or settlements in lieu of litigation have occurred 
because of the considerable uncertainties that exist  we cannot predict the outcome of pending or future litigation with certainty 
in general  we have accrued only the costs of defense because we cannot reasonably estimate the risk or any potential range of possible loss 
based on consultation with our legal advisors  we believe that resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for a specific period 
results of operations in the following discussion  reportable segment results and total reportable segment results include all elements of net income available to common stockholders except realized investment gains 
realized investment gains are gains and losses on sales and writedowns of investments  net of related income taxes 
we include realized investment gains in the corporate and other segment 
we use reportable segment results in assessing the performance of our business segments and believe that reportable segment results are relevant and useful information 
we may realize investment gains in our sole discretion from our available for sale equity and bond portfolios 
reportable segment results as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following tables illustrate our results before and after the inclusion of realized investment gains consolidated summary of income total reportable segment results a realized investment gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders consolidated earnings per share basic total reportable segment results b realized investment gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders fully diluted total reportable segment results realized investment gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders a includes relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
b includes per share of income relating to cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
average number of shares outstanding    average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution    net income available to common stockholders increased in and in with the results reflecting lower realized investment gains and the other factors described below 
total reportable segment results increased in and in  due to increased profitability in the individual products  benefit partners and corporate and other segments 
the increase in reflected the deployment of corporate capital into the more profitable individual products  aip and benefit partners segments primarily through the acquisition of guarantee 
aip decreased in reflecting a decline in jpsc earnings and increased competition for fixed annuity products 
communications segment results decreased due to a weak advertising market throughout net realized investment gains decreased in reflecting bond losses and writedowns  partially offset by gains from sales of equities  and increased in total reportable segment results per share  including the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for derivatives  increased in and in  reflecting the increase in core business earnings and share repurchases in and net income available to common stockholders per share increased in and in and net income available to common stockholders per share assuming dilution increased in and in for the same reasons as well as lower realized investment gains in due to share repurchases  net of stock option and incentive plan issuances  the average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased to million shares in and to million shares in results by business segment we assess profitability by business segment and measure other operating statistics as detailed in the separate segment discussions that follow 
sales are one of the statistics we use to track performance 
because of the nature of our sales  which are primarily long duration contracts in the individual products and aip segments  sales in a given quarter do not have a material impact on operating results and therefore are not considered to be material information 
however  trends relating to new product sales over a longer period of time may be an indicator of future growth and profitability 
we determine reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way we organize for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance 
we assign invested assets backing insurance liabilities to segments in relation to policyholder funds and reserves 
we assign net dac and voba  reinsurance receivables and communications assets to the respective segments where those assets originate 
we also assign invested assets to back capital allocated to each segment in relation to our philosophy for managing business risks  reflecting appropriate conservatism 
we assign the remainder of invested and other assets to the corporate and other segment 
results by reportable segment individual products aip a benefit partners communications corporate and other total reportable segment results net realized investment gains net income available to common stockholders a includes relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
segment assets individual products   aip   benefit partners communications corporate and other   total assets   we discuss each reportable segment in more detail below 
individual products the individual products segment markets individual life insurance policies through independent general agents  independent national account marketing firms  agency building general agents  home service agents  broker dealers  banks and strategic alliances 
individual products include universal life ul and variable universal life vul  together referred to as ul type products  as well as traditional life products 
the operating cycle for life insurance products is long term in nature  therefore  actuarial assumptions are important to financial reporting for these products 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
we recognize traditional premium receipts as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
interest sensitive product or ul type product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder so we do not recognize them as revenues when received 
revenues and reportable segment results on these products arise over time from mortality  expense and surrender charges to policyholder fund balances policy charges 
additionally  we earn interest spreads on all ul type and traditional products 
policy benefits include interest credited to policyholder fund balances and claim related costs 
reportable segment results for both traditional and ul type products also include earnings on required capital 
segment results were life premiums and other considerations ul and investment product charges investment income  net of expenses other income total revenues      policy benefits expenses total benefits and expenses     reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results individual products reportable segment results increased in and in both years increases reflect growth of the business in force  however  the significant increase was due primarily to the guarantee acquisition 
the following table summarizes key information for individual products which we believe are our important drivers and indicators of future profitability life insurance premium sales sales excluding large case boli large case boli individual traditional insurance premiums average ul policyholder fund balances    average vul separate account assets   average face amount of insurance in force total    ul type policies    average assets    life insurance premium sales  excluding large case boli  increased in and decreased in the results reflected increased sales as a result of our premier partnering initiative and the introduction of several new ul products 
agency channels provided  and of the life insurance premium sales excluding large case boli for each of the three years presented above 
the remainder was comprised primarily of single premium products targeted principally to financial institutions 
large case boli sales increased significantly over our business strategy is to respond to individual sales opportunities for large case boli when the market accommodates required returns 
thus  boli sales will vary widely between periods 
revenues include traditional insurance premiums  policy charges  and net investment income 
individual traditional premiums decreased in as a result of a decrease in our traditional business in force and certain reclassifications made in related to the integration of guarantee 
individual traditional premiums increased in resulting primarily from the guarantee acquisition 
ul and investment product charges increased and in and due to growth in average ul policyholder fund balances of and in and the significant increases in were due to the guarantee acquisition 
average vul separate account assets declined and increased in and the decline in is primarily due to the drop in the equity markets 
adjusting for the decrease in fair market value  net of dividends  separate account balances would have increased by approximately in and total fund balances would have grown by about in investment income  net of expenses  increased and in and  reflecting the growth in average policyholder funds and changes in investment yields 
the average investment spread on ul type products calculated as the difference between portfolio yields earned on invested assets less interest credited to policyholder funds  assuming the same level of invested assets increased basis points to in and increased basis points to in interest spreads are affected by portfolio yields and crediting rates  and also may vary over time due to our competitive strategies and changes in product design 
total policy benefits increased in due to an increase in mortality and interest credited  consistent with the growth in business  and in due primarily to the guarantee acquisition 
policy benefits on ul type products increased to of average policyholder funds and separate accounts in versus and in and policy benefits include interest credited to policyholder accounts on ul type products and death benefits in excess of fund balances 
total expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba decreased and increased in and the decline is due primarily to a decrease in amortization of dac and voba resulting from the increase in mortality on ul type policies 
amortization of dac and voba on ul type products may decline when mortality increases  provided that longer term assumptions remain appropriate 
expenses on individual traditional products were  and of premiums in  and for ul type products  expenses as a percentage of policyholder funds and separate accounts were  and in  and the improvement over reflects economies of scale from the guarantee acquisition 
financial and operating risks for this segment include  among others  asset liability management  interest rate risks  changes in the underlying assumptions of dac and voba and the effects of unresolved litigation 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the financial position  capital resources and liquidity as well as in the market risk exposures sections 
average individual products assets grew in and in sales of ul type products and growth in existing policyholder funds from interest credited  partially offset by vul separate account declines  contributed to the increase 
s increase was due to the guarantee acquisition  net receipts on ul type products  new sales and growth in existing policyholder funds 
the return on average individual products assets for and was 
annuity and investment products annuity and investment products are marketed through most distribution channels discussed in the individual products segment as well as through financial institutions  investment professionals and annuity marketing organizations 
jpsc markets variable life insurance and variable annuities written by our insurance subsidiaries and other carriers  and also sells other securities and mutual funds 
reportable segment results were policy charges  premiums and other considerations investment income  net of expenses concession and other income total revenues policy benefits expenses total benefits and expenses reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results reportable segment results decreased in and increased in the largest factors contributing to the decrease were a decline in net income from jpsc of  and lower annuity surrenders that reduced policy charges 
the following table summarizes key information for aip fixed annuity premium sales   variable annuity premium sales investment product sales    average policyholder fund balances    average separate account policyholder fund balances effective investment spreads for fixed annuities fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances average assets    we derive annuity revenues from investment income on segment assets  policy charges  and concession income earned on investment product sales by jpsc 
aip revenues increased in and in the increase is due to growth in policyholder fund balances  offset by lower surrender charge income included in policy charges and lower jpsc concession income  and include the adoption of fasb  which caused a one time increase to net investment income of the increase in is primarily due to the guarantee acquisition and higher jpsc concession income 
fixed annuity premium sales increased and in and recently introduced products drove the strong sales  especially a fixed annuity with a market value adjustment 
increased distribution  particularly in financial institutions  also contributed to sales growth 
s results reflect new products introduced in through the existing distribution channels 
jpsc s concession and other income decreased and increased in and the decrease in is due to lower volumes of equity market purchase sale transactions 
the increase in is due to higher volumes of securities and mutual fund transactions  and the integration of a broker dealer acquisition 
fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances decreased to from in the lower lapse rates reflect the combined effects of lower interest rates on competing investments  increased surrender charge protection on our in force block of business  and internal conservation initiatives 
the surrender rate in the aip segment is influenced by many factors such as the portion of the business that has low or no remaining surrender charges  competition from annuity products including those which pay upfront interest rate bonuses or higher market rates and rising interest rates that may make returns available on new annuities or investment products more attractive than our older annuities 
fund balances with or more surrender charges  including payout annuities  increased to at year end from at year end an inherent risk in the annuity business is that secular declines in investment yields coupled with intense rate competition from competing products could further compress our investment spread 
another risk that we face is rising interest rates or competition from other financial products could lead to lapses particularly in the portion of business subject to low or no surrender charges 
when surrenders increased to in  the impact on profitability was not material due to offsetting surrender charges 
we mitigate these risks by utilizing the asset liability management practices discussed later 
total aip benefits and expenses increased in versus in policy benefits  which are mainly comprised of interest credited to policyholder accounts  as a percentage of average policyholder fund balances were in and in and total aip expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease is due primarily to the lower commission expenses of jpsc as well as a decrease in amortization expense as we reflect the effect of lower surrenders in adjustments to amortization rates of dac and voba and as older products with higher amortization rates are replaced with newer products which have less associated dac 
the expense growth was due to an increase in concessions related to jpsc operations  similar to the increases in concession and other income  and an increase in amortization of dac due to higher surrenders 
effective spreads on fixed annuities declined to in from  primarily due to continued strong sales of our lower commission five year products 
these products carry a lower spread requirement based on commission rates that are approximately of full commissions 
the lower commission has the eventual effect of decreasing expenses through reduced dac amortization 
of the year to date basis points spread compression  approximately one third represents economic spread contraction that occurs in declining interest rate environments and affects earnings  while the remaining two thirds is related to the lower commission products and does not affect earnings 
jpsc earnings included in the segment results were  and for  and the decline is directly related to lower equity and mutual fund purchase sale transactions  which had increased in benefit partners the benefit partners segment offers group non medical products such as term life  disability and dental insurance to the employer marketplace 
these products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system of regional group offices 
these offices develop business through employee benefit brokers  third party administrators and other employee benefit firms 
the benefit partners segment was created in january through the integration of our existing group life and disability operations into guarantee s life  disability and dental operations acquired in december segment results before include only the group life and health products sold by jp life 
reportable segment results were premiums and other considerations investment income  net of expenses total revenues policy benefits expenses total benefits and expenses reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results benefit partners reportable segment results increased and in and  primarily due to the growth in this business and the integration of guarantee 
the following table summarizes key information for benefit partners life  disability  and dental annualized sales loss ratio total expenses  of premium income average assets premium income benefit partners revenues increased and in and  with reflecting the guarantee acquisition 
sales for the core life  disability and dental lines of business grew and in and the increase in revenue results from both sales growth and satisfactory persistency in our non medical business 
the revenue growth was somewhat dampened by our exiting the excess loss medical business 
these results reflect the success of our technologically advanced approach to selling and underwriting group insurance products 
policy benefits increased and in and  consistent with the growth of business in force including guarantee 
our life  disability and dental incurred loss ratio improved to in versus in  reflecting continued claims management efforts coupled with favorable morbidity and mortality 
the loss ratio of did not include guarantee and therefore is not comparable to later years 
risks beyond normal competition that may impact this segment include a weak economy may increase disability claim costs  an acceleration in medical cost inflation can put pressure on non medical benefit costs because employers may focus more on the employer s cost of non medical programs  and concentration risks from acts of terrorism not priced for or reinsured 
we are mitigating these risks by monitoring new and existing claims and industry health care trend reports which serve as indicators of increased employer medical costs  and through intensive review of our concentration risks 
our catastrophe reinsurance agreement that expires in april covers extraordinary life claims arising from catastrophic events in the group life line 
because this catastrophe reinsurance agreement cannot be replaced except with a much higher premium and deductible and with a terrorism exclusion  we have determined not to purchase catastrophic coverage and instead will rely on case by case management to mitigate our concentration exposures 
total expenses including the net deferral and amortization of policy acquisition costs increased in this is significantly less than the increase in sales of core products of as we benefited from both the integration of the group business to omaha and increased efficiency in policy and claims administration 
we expect that future increases in sales would correlate more closely to an increase in expenses as additional policy and claims administration expenses are incurred 
total expenses increased primarily due to the guarantee acquisition 
as a percentage of premium income  total expenses were for and for  and without guarantee  for the improvement is due primarily to the integration of jp life s and guarantee s group operations 
communications jpcc operates radio and television broadcast properties and produces syndicated sports and entertainment programming 
reportable segment results were communications revenues net operating costs and expenses broadcast cash flow depreciation and amortization corporate general and administrative expenses net interest expense operating revenue before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results reportable segment results decreased in and increased in the decline was primarily due to lower demand for advertising  which reflects the general softening of the economy in all markets 
combined revenues for radio and television decreased in and grew in excluding political revenues  radio and television declined in and grew in the decline is primarily due to decreases in national sales  slowing economic conditions  and lost revenues due to the september th event 
revenues from sports operations decreased and in and the decline reflects the impact of weak demand for advertising due to the slowing economic conditions 
sports advertising is typically sold with three to six month lead times and economic activity was slowing during the prime sports selling season 
we have commitments of to pay rights fees to the acc and sec conferences 
we have offsetting commitments of by various other broadcasters to repurchase some of those rights  and we have a partner in acc basketball to mitigate some of the exposure 
we expect advertising contracts that we sell to produce profits on each product  however  sales contracts typically have a term of three years or less 
thus  there are currently no sales contracts on our books to offset exposure in later years under the conference agreements 
see note which is incorporated by reference 
broadcast cash flow declined in and grew in total expenses  excluding interest expense  decreased and increased in and  respectively 
expenses as a percent of communication revenues were  and for  and the increase in this percentage is due mainly to the decrease in revenues  while expenses have been held relatively flat year to year 
a one time insurance recovery of after tax reduced corporate general and administrative expenses in  which helped segment earnings but is not reflected in broadcast cash flow 
effective january   jpcc will no longer be required to systematically amortize the amounts paid for fcc licenses or goodwill from previous acquisitions 
instead  those amounts will be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we do not expect to record impairment losses on jpcc s current intangible assets 
fcc license and goodwill amortization expense was in each of the last three years 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment includes the excess capital of the insurance subsidiaries  other corporate investments including impaired securities  blocks of business from previous acquisitions not conforming to our other reportable segment strategies  benefit plan net assets  goodwill related to previous acquisitions  and corporate debt 
the reportable segment results primarily contain the earnings on the invested excess capital  interest expense related to the corporate debt  and operating expenses that are corporate in nature ie advertising  charitable and civic contributions  goodwill amortization  etc the net operating results for blocks of acquired business are insignificant 
all net capital gains and losses  which reflect all impairments of securities  are reported in this segment 
the following table summarizes results for this segment earnings on investments interest expense on debt and exchangeable securities operating expenses provision for income tax expense benefit total expenses reportable segment results before dividends on capital securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends on capital securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock reportable segment results realized investment gains  net reportable segment results  including realized gains reportable segment results excluding realized gains increased in and decreased in  for the reasons that follow 
the increase in investment earnings in is due to an increase in equity investment income and a reclassification of intersegment interest expense 
the earnings on investments for this segment include default charge income received from the operating segments for the corporate and other segment s assumption of all credit related losses on the invested assets of those segments 
default charges included in this segment s investment income for the last three years amounted to  and and are based on invested assets of the operating segments 
the drop in investment earnings in was due to lower invested assets for this segment following the guarantee acquisition in december earnings on investments in this segment can fluctuate based upon opportunistic repurchases of common stock  the amount of excess capital generated by the operating segments and lost investment income on impaired securities 
interest expense on debt and exchangeable securities decreased in primarily due to lower average interest rates  as the average debt outstanding remained relatively constant during the year 
operating expenses vary with the level of corporate activities and strategies 
goodwill amortization of  and  excluding jpcc  was included in operating expenses for the three years ended as we adopt a new accounting standard for  we will no longer amortize goodwill  but will test its value for impairment at least annually 
we do not expect to record a material loss on goodwill impairment for amounts currently recorded 
the provision for income tax expense includes the tax benefit of preferred dividends on capital securities  which we record gross of related tax effects 
income taxes decreased in due to the implementation of strategies that reduced federal income taxes on investment earnings and the resolution of tax issues for which we had previously established provisions 
income taxes decreased in due primarily to the tax effect of lower segment pre tax operating results as compared to realized investment gains and losses for include a net after tax loss on our bond portfolio  including both writedowns of and actual sales in the normal course of business  which were offset by gains in equities  resulting in a net gain of this loss was driven primarily by recent economic events  including high profile bankruptcies and the continued weak economy 
net after tax losses in our bond portfolio were and for and the following table summarizes assets assigned to this segment at the end of each year parent company  passive investment companies and corporate line assets of insurance subsidiaries  unrealized gain loss on fixed interest investments co insurance receivables on acquired blocks   employee benefit plan assets goodwill arising from insurance acquisitions other total   total assets for the corporate and other segment decreased in due primarily to repayment of commercial paper debt  writedowns of impaired securities and the repurchase of common stock 
unrealized gains and losses on all available for sale fixed income securities are assigned to this segment  and increased during and during the increase both years is primarily due to declining market interest rates  partially offset by declines in market values of financial services stocks 
financial position  capital resources and liquidity our primary resources are investments related to our individual products  aip and benefit partners segments  properties and other assets utilized in all segments and investments backing corporate capital 
the investments section reviews our investment portfolio and key strategies 
total assets increased  in due to growth in income  net policyholder contract deposits and an increase in the value of available for sale securities 
in  total assets increased primarily due to growth in separate accounts  net policyholder contract deposits and an increase in available for sale securities 
the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments defer the costs of acquiring new business  including first year commissions  first year bonus interest  certain costs of underwriting and issuing policies plus agency office expenses referred to as dac 
we capitalize acquisition costs up to the amounts we used in the specific product pricing models  and we expense any acquisition costs in excess of the pricing allowable 
when we acquire new business through an acquisition  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to a separately identifiable intangible asset  referred to as voba 
we initially establish voba as the actuarially determined present value of future gross profits of each business acquired 
we amortize dac and voba on traditional products in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
we amortize dac and voba on ul type products relative to the future estimated gross profits egp from those products 
the egp for ul type products include the following components estimates of fees charged to policyholders to cover mortality  surrenders and maintenance costs  estimated mortality in excess of fund balances accumulated  expected interest rate spreads between income earned and amounts credited to policyholder accounts  and estimated cost of policy administration maintenance 
egp is also reduced by our estimate of future losses due to defaults in fixed interest investments 
dac and voba related to ul type products are sensitive to a change in our assumptions regarding egp components  and any change in such an assumption will immediately impact the current dac and voba balances with the change reflected through the income statement 
at december   the dac and voba related to individual ul type products amounted to of the  on the balance sheet 
the models and our assumptions regarding egp that we utilize for calculation of amortization expense for ul type products are continuously reviewed so that the assumptions reflect a reasonable view of the future 
we consider three assumptions to be most significant estimated mortality  estimated interest spread  and estimated future policy lapses 
the following table reflects the possible change which could occur in a given year  if we change our assumptions as illustrated  as a percentage of current dac and voba balances related to individual ul type products on our balance sheet one time one time increase in dac decrease in dac quantitative change in significant assumptions and voba and voba estimated mortality improving degrading per year for years from the current estimate estimated interest spread increasing decreasing basis points per year for years over the current spread estimated policy lapse rates decreasing increasing immediately and then increasing decreasing per year for years while this list does not cover all of the risks we face in the ordinary course of business  it does highlight some of the major risks on the assumptions that we make as we amortize the dac and voba balances 
in general  a change in an assumption that improves our expectations regarding egp is going to have the impact of deferring the amortization of dac and voba into the future  thus increasing earnings and the current dac and voba balances 
conversely  a change in assumptions that decreases egp will have the effect of speeding up the amortization of dac and voba  thus reducing earnings and lowering the current dac and voba balances 
our review of these assumptions in recent years has resulted in increases to the year end individual ul type dac and voba balances of  and in   and we also adjust the carrying value of dac and voba to reflect changes in the unrealized gains and losses in available for sale securities since this impacts egp 
note contains roll forwards of dac and voba including the amounts capitalized  amounts amortized and the effect of the unrealized gains  and is incorporated by reference 
goodwill was and at december  and  reflecting amortization 
goodwill as a percentage of shareholders equity was and at year end and under previous accounting standards we regularly reviewed carrying amounts of dac and voba  and goodwill for indications of value impairment  with consideration given to the financial performance of acquired properties  future gross profits of insurance in force and other factors 
at december  and  we had reinsurance receivables of and and policy loans of and which are related to the businesses of jp financial that are coinsured with household international hi affiliates 
hi has provided payment  performance and capital maintenance guarantees with respect to the balances receivable 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance activities 
we have not suffered any significant credit losses from reinsurance activities in the last three years 
capital resources stockholders equity the following table shows our capital adequacy total assets less separate accounts      total stockholders equity      ratio of stockholders equity to assets less separate accounts the ratio of equity to assets less separate accounts has remained relatively constant 
unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which are included as a component of stockholders equity  increased and in and we used in  shares at an average cost of and in  shares at an average cost of to purchase common shares outstanding 
in february and again in november  our board of directors updated its ongoing share repurchase authorization to cover million shares of common stock  and we intend to continue to make opportunistic repurchases 
we consider existing capital resources to be more than adequate to support the current level of our business activities 
our business plan places priority on redirecting certain capital resources invested in bonds and stocks into our core businesses  which would be expected to produce higher returns over time 
the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments are subject to regulatory constraints 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above required levels 
these capital levels together with the rating agencies assessments of our business strategies have enabled the major life insurance affiliates to attain the following claims paying ratings jp life jpfic jpla am am a a a standard poor s aaa aaa aaa fitch aaa aaa aaa these ratings are currently the highest available by the respective rating agencies 
all of the ratings were affirmed in the last nine months 
in the fall of  standard poor s affirmed our aaa rating  but changed its outlook to negative which is consistent with standard poor s outlook on the entire life insurance industry 
the other two agencies mentioned above affirmed their highest ratings 
a very significant drop in these ratings  while not anticipated  could potentially impact future sales and or accelerate surrenders on our business in force 
debt and exchangeable securities we have a bank credit agreement for unsecured revolving credit  under which we have the option to borrow at various interest rates 
the agreement is for and extends to may we intend to replace the expiring bank credit agreement with a new agreement in may the credit agreement principally supports the issuance of commercial paper 
as of december   outstanding commercial paper had various maturities  with none in excess of days  although maturities can be up to days 
in the event that we are not able to remarket commercial paper at maturity  we have sufficient liquidity  consisting of the bank credit agreement  liquid assets  such as equity securities  and other resources to retire these obligations 
the weighted average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings outstanding of and at december  and were and 
the maximum amount outstanding during and was and our commercial paper is currently rated by two rating agencies  as follows agency rating fitch f standard poor s a these are both the highest ratings that the agencies issue and have been affirmed in the past nine months 
a significant drop in these ratings  while not anticipated  could cause us to pay higher rates in commercial paper borrowings or lose access to the commercial paper market 
our insurance subsidiaries have sold us treasury obligations and collateralized mortgages under repurchase agreements involving various counterparties  accounted for as financing arrangements 
proceeds normally are used to purchase securities with longer durations as an asset liability management strategy and to provide acquisition financing 
from time to time  we use repurchase agreements in lieu of commercial paper borrowings in order to obtain a lower borrowing cost 
at december  and  repurchase agreements were and the maximum amounts outstanding were and during and  as the portion used to help fund the guarantee acquisition was repaid in the first half of followed by increased asset liability management activities 
the securities involved had a fair value and amortized cost of and at year end versus and at the end of at december  and  we had and of exchangeable securities outstanding  reflecting the mandatorily exchangeable debt securities meds 
we repaid the meds in cash in january we had of guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in subordinated debentures capital securities outstanding at december  and at an average interest rate of  maturing in but redeemable at our option beginning in at december  and  net advances from subsidiaries were and  all of which are eliminated in consolidation 
liquidity we meet liquidity requirements primarily by positive cash flows from the operations of subsidiaries 
we have sufficient overall sources of liquidity to satisfy operating requirements 
primary sources of cash from our insurance operations are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities and investment income 
primary uses of cash for our insurance operations include purchases of investments  payment of insurance benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business  dividends and income taxes 
primary sources of cash from the communications operations are revenues from advertising  and primary uses include payments for commissions  compensation and compensation related costs  sports rights  interest  income taxes and purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by operations in  and was  and s increase reflects changes in payables and receivables including our receipt of approximately in premiums related primarily to small case boli type products unprocessed at year end 
s increase of reflects changes in payables and receivables related to the timing of investment commitments net of higher policy acquisition costs 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  in  and the significant decrease in reflected additional sales of securities required to fund increased surrenders primarily in the aip segment and coinsured policies with hi in the corporate and other segment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and in  and  with reflecting higher policyholder contract deposits coupled with lower surrenders 
the decrease of is primarily due to net borrowing repayments of versus short term borrowings of reflecting the guarantee acquisition 
cash inflows from policyholder contract deposits net of withdrawals were  and the decrease is a result of higher annuity surrenders and decreased ul type contract receipts  with both factors reversing in in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments  debt servicing obligations and other expenses  we received internal dividends from subsidiaries 
total cash dividends paid by subsidiaries were in  in and in included extraordinary dividends of from jp life representing all its publicly traded equity securities and from jp financial in connection with the merger of alexander hamilton life insurance company of america and guarantee into jpfic 
jp life  jpfic and jpcc were the primary sources of dividends in all three years 
our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws in the states of domicile that limit the amount of dividends that can be paid without the prior approval of the respective state s insurance commissioner 
we have no reason to believe that such approval will be withheld  if required 
in connection with a previous acquisition  we acquired a closed block of business that was financed by a loan program collateralized by pledged mutual fund shares of our policyholders 
in late  the acquired company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party that provides for the initial and periodic purchase of the majority of its loans receivable 
this agreement is renewable on an annual basis 
if the agreement is not renewed  we can issue debt to fund the amounts or terminate the entire program 
the amount of loans outstanding at december  was we have no other off balance sheet arrangements of a financing nature 
cash and cash equivalents were  and at december   and the increase at year end reflected amounts that would be used to pay off the meds in january additionally  fixed income and equity securities held by the parent company and non regulated subsidiaries were  and at these dates 
these securities are considered to be sources of liquidity to support our strategies 
jpcc has commitments for purchases of syndicated television programming and commitments on other contracts and future sports programming rights of approximately as of december   payable through the year we have commitments to sell a portion of the sports programming rights to other entities for  over the same period 
these commitments are not reflected as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the programs are not currently available for use 
advertising revenues that are sold on an annual basis are expected to fund the purchase commitments 
total debt and equity securities available for sale at december  and were  and  investments our strategy for managing the insurance investment portfolio is to consistently meet pricing assumptions while achieving the highest possible after tax yields over the long term 
we invest cash flows primarily in fixed income securities 
the nature and quality of investments held by insurance subsidiaries must comply with state regulatory requirements 
we have established a formal investment policy that we use to achieve overall quality and diversification objectives 
we held the following carrying amounts of investments december  december  publicly issued bonds   privately placed bonds   mortgage loans on real property   common stock policy loans preferred stock real estate other cash and equivalents total   certain amounts reported in the prior year s schedule of privately placed and publicly issued assets have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year 
our internal guidelines require an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is a 
our guidelines also limit the amount of lower quality investments and require diversification by issuer and asset type 
due to deteriorating general economic conditions during  several bonds were downgraded to below investment grade 
we monitor higher risk investments in order to determine if the securities have experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
securities that experience other than temporary declines in value are adjusted to fair values through a charge to earnings 
impairment losses totaling  and were recognized in the years ending december   and the increase in impairment losses in reflected several high profile bankruptcies and the continued declining economy 
we state mortgage loans on real property net of an allowance for credit losses 
we determine this allowance for specific impaired loans by calculating the fair value of each loan  utilizing estimated future cash flows of the impaired loan  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we also set aside an additional allowance based on aggregate loans with similar risk characteristics utilizing historical statistics 
at december  our allowance for mortgage loan credit losses was for and carrying amounts of investments categorized as higher risk assets were december  december  bonds near or in default bonds below investment grade  mortgage loans days delinquent or in foreclosure mortgage loans restructured foreclosed properties subtotal  higher risk assets  all other investments   total cash and investments   a weak economy or a more pronounced downturn  or events which affect one or more companies or industries  could lead to further credit related portfolio losses in higher risk and other investments 
our guidelines permit use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
our actual use of derivatives has been limited to managing well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps with a current notional value of and were open as of december  and also  during  interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of expired 
there were no terminations of derivative financial instruments in or effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  and the discussion in note is incorporated by reference 
mortgage backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations at december  which are included in debt securities available for sale  were as follows federal agency issued mortgage backed securities   corporate private labeled mortgage backed securities   total   our investment strategy with respect to mortgage backed securities mbs s focuses on actively traded  less volatile issues that produce relatively stable cash flows 
the majority of mbs holdings are sequential and planned amortization class tranches of federal agency issuers 
the mbs portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to lower cash flow volatility over a range of interest rate levels 
we adopted  eitf recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  effective for fiscal quarters beginning after march  given the nature of the investments held  this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
market risk exposures since our assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  our financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve  and equity price risks 
during  year us treasury rates increased basis points versus a decrease of basis points in in and  in response to deteriorating economic conditions and the uncertainty created by the september th event  risk premiums over rates that could otherwise be earned on us treasury securities increased due to continued poor liquidity conditions 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases and funds prepaid are then reinvested at lower yields 
we limit this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio mainly on non callable securities  by carefully selecting mbs s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for our products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges  and higher average returns from equity markets  may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
we manage this risk by adjusting our interest crediting rates with due regard to the yield of our investment portfolio and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  our life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest we credit 
for interest sensitive life products  our minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  our minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
we employ various methodologies to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
our asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of our insurance operations 
we monitor the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  measuring the optionality of cash flows 
our goal in this analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for us as a whole 
at december  and  and of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
we also consider the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and other debt 
the following table shows our estimate of the impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would have on our earnings for a calendar year  based on the assumptions contained in our model 
the incremental income loss derives primarily from differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduce to our model 
estimated incremental change in interest rates income loss basis points basis points basis points basis points we derived these estimated incremental income loss amounts by modeling estimated cash flows of our market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of our current investment strategy  and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when borrowers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates within insurance portfolios consider the relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on our existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact as discussed above of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
changes in interest rates illustrated above assume parallel shifts in the yield curve  graded pro rata over four quarters 
we believe that a basis point increase or decrease  experienced gradually over four quarters  reflects reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  the incremental income loss for shifts larger than basis points or that occurs more quickly than quarterly grading does not have a linear relationship to the values shown above 
the incremental loss resulting from a larger increase in interest rates would be proportionally greater due to the optionality of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
in contrast  the incremental income resulting from a larger decrease in interest rates would be proportionally less due to the effect of minimum rate guarantees in our interest sensitive liabilities 
a significant change in the slope of the yield curve could also affect our results 
for example  competing products such as bank cds could become relatively more attractive than our longer duration annuities under an inverted yield curve  resulting in higher policyholder withdrawals 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our equity securities other than trading 
we hold common stock with a fair value of  approximately is in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
our exchangeable securities were exchangeable into shares of bankamerica common stock  but were repaid in cash in january we believe that a hypothetical decline in the equity market is reasonably possible in the near term 
if the market value of the s p index  and of bankamerica common stock specifically  decreased  the fair value of our common stock as of december  would change as follows hypothetical change in fair value from market decline bankamerica common stock remaining equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated  but may be subject to changes in fair values which are reflected in equity

external trends and forward looking information we operate within the united states financial services and communications markets  which are both subject to general economic conditions 
after increasing in and much of  interest rates on longer maturity instruments began trending down later in as economic growth slowed and dropped dramatically in changes in rates may affect our businesses in many ways as discussed earlier 
our operations are also affected over the longer term by demographic shifts  global markets  technological innovation and overall capital market volatility 
these forces impact us in various ways such as demand for our insurance products and advertising revenues  competition from other financial services providers  competition from emerging technologies for television and radio advertising  competition for new investments  debt costs  mergers and consolidations within the financial services and communications sectors  and costs inherent in administering complex financial products 
the industry s individual life insurance sales in the us decreased for  reflecting a continued weakness in the overall economy  changes in federal estate and income tax laws and competition from financial products other than life insurance 
as discussed previously  our individual life sales growth has been better than the overall industry 
regulatory and legal environment the us insurance industry has experienced an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  sales of business lines and marketing arrangements with other financial services providers 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger insurers  banks  securities brokers  mutual funds and other non traditional competitors 
the gramm leach bliley act modernized the regulatory framework for financial services in the us and allows insurance companies  banks and securities firms to affiliate under financial holding companies 
with the passage of this law  combined with changing demographics  technological advances and customer expectations for one stop shopping  we expect further strategic alignments in the financial services industry 
we continue to analyze our options within this environment for increasing distribution  adding products and technology and improving economies of scale 
prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic has completed the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods 
our statutory surplus increased as we implemented sap effective january  state guaranty associations make assessments to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies 
assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
we have accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions
