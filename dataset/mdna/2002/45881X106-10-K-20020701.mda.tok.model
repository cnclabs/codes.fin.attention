for fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from paid third party advertising with the remaining of revenue coming from the products and services segment  which was launched in june  for the fourth quarter of fiscal products and services segment revenue represented nearly of the overall revenue generated by the company 
management of the company believes that this trend will continue with products and services segment revenue eventually becoming the dominant revenue driver of the company
