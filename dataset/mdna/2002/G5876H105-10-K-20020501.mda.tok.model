table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits utilizing proprietary communications mixed signal and digital signal processing technology for communications related markets 
our products provide the critical interface between analog signals and the digital information used in computing and communications systems and enable our customers to store and transmit digital information reliably and at high speeds 
we were founded in  and our business has grown rapidly since inception 
we are a fabless integrated circuit company  which means that we rely on independent  third party contractors to perform manufacturing  assembly and test functions 
this approach allows us to focus on designing  developing and marketing our products and significantly reduces the amount of capital we need to invest in manufacturing products 
in january  we acquired galileo technology ltd 
in a stock for stock transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately billion 
galileo develops high performance internetworking and switching products for the broadband communications market 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the operating results of galileo have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the communications market  we offer transceiver products  switching products  internetworking products and wireless local area network products 
our primary customers for our communications products are leading manufacturers of high speed networking equipment 
in the storage market  our products include read channel devices  socs and preamplifiers 
our customers for our storage products are manufacturers of hard disk drives for the enterprise  desktop and mobile computer markets and the emerging consumer applications market 
the storage market is highly competitive and is dominated by a small number of large companies 
these companies have historically experienced marginal profit levels from sales of their storage products and are under enormous pricing pressure from their customers  which they typically pass through to their integrated circuit suppliers 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four significant customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to three significant customers  and in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to five significant customers 
we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
sales to customers in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue for the years ended january   and  respectively 
because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of communications and storage devices are located in asia  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to customers in that region 
all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures 
we expect to increase our research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenditures as we seek to expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january in a week year  each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
the additional week in a week year is added to the fourth quarter  making such quarter consist of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks  and fiscal years and were comprised of weeks 
for presentation purposes  our financial statements and notes and 
table of contents this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to january as our year end 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
however  some of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and rights of return on product unsold by the distributors 
product revenue on sales made through distributors with rights of return is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
additionally  collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms 
as a result  revenue on sales to customers with payment terms substantially greater than our normal payment terms is deferred and is recognized as revenue as the payments become due 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
at january   revenue of million was deferred with an associated gross profit of million and all of it related to distributor sales 
our provision for estimated price protection  sales returns and allowances on product sales is recorded in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if actual price protection granted to distributors or product returns exceed our estimates  additional reductions of revenue would result 
we also enter into development agreements with some of our customers 
development revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  with the associated costs included in research and development expense 
we estimate the percentage of completion of our development contracts based on an analysis of progress toward completion  which is measured using input measures such as the percentage of completion 
accounting for income taxes 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets as of january   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
to estimate our tax provision  we consider our taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we enjoy tax holidays in bermuda  singapore and israel  which expire at various dates and which are subject to our compliance with various terms and conditions set by the local tax authorities 
in the united states  we pay income tax on the income of our us subsidiary  marvell semiconductor  inc  and may be 
table of contents subject to us income tax on any foreign income that is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
the determination of whether the income of a foreign corporation is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states requires significant management judgment  as it involves a consideration of all the facts and circumstances and the application of legal standards that are uncertain 
our position is that our foreign business operations do not generate any income that is effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
we recorded a tax provision of million in the year ended january  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounts receivable reserves 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the realization of our accounts receivable and our results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and v a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between net book values of the asset and its estimated fair value 
as of january   we have not recorded any impairment charges related to our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  among other things  a goodwill impairment test within six months of adoption and annual impairment tests thereafter 
we adopted sfas in february 
table of contents upon adoption  we are required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test prescribed by sfas we have not yet completed this analysis and expect to complete it within the required time frame of the first six months of fiscal litigation costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
we are aggressively defending these litigations and believe no material adverse outcome will result 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended january  net revenue operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets acquired in process research and development total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended january  and net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
net revenue was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase in net revenue reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our communications products during the year ended january   in part due to our acquisition of galileo 
the increase in net revenue also reflects the commencement of volume shipments of our system on chip storage products during the year ended january  revenue from communications products totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue from storage products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue derived from development contracts increased sequentially during fiscal and  but represented less than of our net revenues for each year 
we expect that revenue from storage products in fiscal will increase from the level of 
table of contents revenue from storage products we reported in fiscal due in part to increases in shipments of our storage socs  which have been widely adopted by the mobile computer sector and which we expect to be adopted by the desktop computer sector in fiscal in addition  we expect growth in revenue from communications products in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in shipments of our gigabit ethernet products  which we expect will continue to be adopted as the replacement of fast ethernet products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross margin  which is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net revenue  was in the year ended january  compared to in the year ended january  the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher margins on our storage products  which resulted from improved manufacturing yields in  as well as a shift in product mix to newer  higher margin products such as our gigabit ethernet transceivers 
also contributing to the increase in gross margin was an increase in the amount of development revenue recognized in fiscal compared to fiscal the costs associated with contracted development work are included in research and development expense 
our gross margins are primarily driven by product mix  however  our margins may also fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
research and development expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional development personnel and the addition of galileo s development personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million  increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses and the additional depreciation expense recorded on galileo s property and equipment  and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we develop new products  migrate to lower process geometries  expand into new markets and technologies  and hire additional personnel 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
selling and marketing expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and the addition of galileo s sales and marketing personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million  increased sales commissions of million  and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that selling and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  expand our sales and marketing efforts  particularly in the communications market  and pay increased sales commissions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to administrative personnel  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
general and administrative expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel and the addition of galileo s administrative personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million 
table of contents and increased legal and other professional fees of million due to our expanding operations and attorney fees associated with our on going legal proceedings 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional administrative personnel and incur increased legal and other costs associated with our expanding operations and ongoing legal proceedings 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering of common stock and in connection with the assumption of stock options as a result of our acquisition of galileo  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting periods 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in amortization expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from additional amounts of deferred stock based compensation being recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the assumption of stock options in connection with our acquisition of galileo 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded billion of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
goodwill is amortized over its estimated economic life of five years  and acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives of five to ten years 
goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to goodwill and acquired intangible assets being amortized for the full year in fiscal compared to only seven days of amortization in fiscal in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles into goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we adopted sfas in february as a result of the adoption  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we have discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense was million for the year ended january  we also reclassified the carrying value of the acquired workforce of million into goodwill because this intangible asset did not arise from contractual or other legal rights and cannot be separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
amortization of the acquired workforce was million for the year ended january  also as part of the adoption of sfas  we reassessed the useful lives of our two remaining acquisition related intangible assets  developed technology and trade name  and determined that the useful life of the galileo trade name should be five years from the date of acquisition instead of its current estimated useful life of ten years 
this change in useful life  which was based on our expected future use of the galileo trade name in our selling and marketing activities as well as its expected contribution to future cash flows  will increase our trade name amortization expense to million per year beginning in fiscal compared to the million we recorded in fiscal upon adoption  we are required to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas we have not yet completed this analysis and expect to complete it within the required time frame of the first six months of fiscal in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased in process research and development  or iprd  of approximately million  which represented approximately of the total purchase price 
as of the acquisition date  the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the iprd had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value of the purchased iprd was expensed on the date of acquisition 
the fair values of galileo s iprd  as well as their developed technologies  were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the 
table of contents present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
a discount rate of was used for developed technology  and rates between and were used for iprd  depending on the stage of completion of each technology 
as of january   the majority of these iprd projects have been fully developed and were completed within our original cost estimates 
the estimated cost to complete the development of the one remaining project is less than million 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and realized gains from the sale of marketable securities  offset by interest paid on capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to interest being earned on higher invested cash balances  as well as realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal the net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in june  as well as the net cash received as a result of our acquisition of galileo in january  contributed to this increase in invested cash balances 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for each of the years ended january  and our effective rate for fiscal was affected by stock based compensation expense as well as non deductible expenses relating to our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense and non deductible  acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
excluding the effect of non deductible  acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
our effective tax rate has decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal a substantial majority of galileo s pretax income is generated in israel  where galileo s operations have approved enterprise status 
this status provides us with a tax holiday on undistributed income generated in specified regions within israel 
years ended january  and net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
net revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue primarily reflects increased volume shipments of storage products and commencement of volume shipments of communications products  which totaled million in fiscal although average selling prices for storage products declined by approximately from fiscal to fiscal  the volume of units shipped increased to approximately million units in from approximately million units in the decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to a product mix change caused by an increase in preamplifier products shipped as a percentage of total storage products shipped  which have a lower average selling price than our read channel products  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in average selling prices for our read channel products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  and compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross profit  which equals net revenue less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for storage products  an increase in average cost per unit for read channel products due to a product mix change  and an increase in preamplifier product revenues as a percentage of total revenues  which contribute a lower gross profit than both read channel and communications products 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation expenses and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
research and development expense was million  or of net 
table of contents revenue  in fiscal and million  or of net revenue  in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of approximately million for the hiring of additional development personnel and a resulting increase in salary and related costs  approximately million of increased spending for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  approximately  for increased depreciation expense due to significant purchases of computer aided design software tools  and approximately million for increased facility and other allocable expenses related to our expanding operations 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to selling and marketing personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
selling and marketing expense was million  or of net revenue  in fiscal and million  or of net revenue  in fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel and a resulting increase in salary and related costs of approximately million  increased sales commissions of approximately million  increased costs of approximately million related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broadened our communications customer and product base  and increased facility and other allocable expenses of approximately million related to our expanding operations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to administrative personnel  professional fees and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
general and administrative expense was million  or of net revenue  in fiscal and million  or of net revenue  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel and a resulting increase in salary and related costs of approximately million 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of approximately million through fiscal and recorded an additional million in fiscal  million of which related to stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition of galileo on january  deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting periods 
amortization of stock based compensation expense was million  or of net revenue  in fiscal and million  or of net revenue  in fiscal the increase in amortization expense was due to the additional amounts of deferred stock based compensation being recorded in fiscal and amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
goodwill is amortized over its estimated economic life of five years  and acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives of five to ten years 
goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense was approximately million  or of net revenue  in fiscal in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased in process research and development  or iprd  of approximately million  which represented approximately of the total purchase price 
as of the acquisition date  the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the iprd had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value of the purchased iprd was expensed on the date of acquisition 
the fair values of galileo s iprd  as well as their developed technologies  were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
a discount rate of was used for developed technology  and rates between and were used for iprd  depending on the stage of completion of each technology 
as of the date of acquisition  the estimated cost to complete the technology under development was approximately million 

table of contents interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest paid on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net was million in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in interest and other income  net was due to interest being earned on higher invested cash balances in fiscal the net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock  which were received on june   contributed to the significant increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our effective rate for fiscal was affected by non deductible expenses relating to our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
excluding the effect of non deductible  acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate for fiscal was liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity as of january  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we raised net proceeds of million through our initial public offering in june in addition  we received million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments  before acquisition costs  as a result of our acquisition of galileo in the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  the cash inflow from operations in fiscal was primarily a result of our generation of income during the period excluding the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expenses  a decrease in inventory and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  accrued employee compensation and income taxes payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  deferred income taxes  prepaid expenses and other assets 
the cash inflow from operations in fiscal and was primarily due to our generation of income during the periods excluding the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expenses in both periods and the impact of in process research and development in fiscal and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other assets 
due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with net day payment terms 
if our sales levels were to increase  it is likely that our levels of accounts receivable would also increase 
our levels of accounts receivable would also increase if customers delayed their payments 
additionally  in order to maintain an adequate supply of product for our customers  we must carry a certain level of inventory 
our inventory level may vary based primarily upon orders received from our customers and our forecast of demand for these products 
other considerations in determining inventory levels may include the product life cycle stage of our products and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended january  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended january  and net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended january  the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  the payment of million of accrued acquisition costs relating to our acquisition of galileo  and purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses of million  partially offset by the proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
the net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was attributable to the net cash received as a result of our acquisition of galileo of million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted solely from purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common 
table of contents stock under our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock in june as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repayment of notes payable and capital lease obligations 
our relationships with the foundries we utilize allow us to cancel all outstanding purchase orders  provided we pay the foundries for all expenses they have incurred in connection with our purchase orders through the date of cancellation 
as of january   foundries had incurred approximately million of manufacturing expenses on our outstanding purchase orders 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with yahoo inc to lease a building in california consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease began on january  and continues through march  total rent payments over the term of the lease will be approximately million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we intend to consolidate our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the lease on one of our existing facilities expired in february  but we have ongoing  non cancelable leases for the two other facilities 
we are currently attempting to secure subtenants for the remainder of our lease terms for these two facilities 
if we are not successful in subleasing these two facilities at rates that will cover our lease cost  we will be required to record a period charge for the difference between the total actual or estimated sublease income and our lease cost 
in addition  we will continue to be required to pay the full amount of our contracted lease payments while the facilities are vacant or while they are subleased at lesser rates 
the future minimum lease payments for the two unoccupied facilities total million 
we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated by operations 
however  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in operating expenses  which are all subject to uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash equivalent and investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
although we currently are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or strategic arrangement  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than after year years years total contractual obligations operating leases capital lease obligations purchase commitments to foundries total contractual cash obligations inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles into goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we adopted sfas in february as a result of the adoption  beginning with the first quarter of fiscal we have discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense was million for the year ended january  we also reclassified the carrying value of the acquired workforce of million into goodwill because this intangible asset did not arise from contractual or other legal rights and cannot be separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
amortization of the acquired workforce was million for the year ended january  also as part of the adoption of sfas  we reassessed the useful lives of our two remaining acquisition related intangible assets  developed technology and trade name  and determined that the useful life of the galileo trade name should be five years from the date of acquisition instead of its current estimated useful life of ten years 
this change in useful life  which was based on our expected future use of the galileo trade name in our selling and marketing activities as well as its expected contribution to future cash flows  will increase our trade name amortization expense to million per year beginning in fiscal compared to the million we recorded in fiscal upon adoption  we are required to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas we have not yet completed this analysis and expect to complete it within the required time frame of the first six months of fiscal in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  and certain provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
we adopted sfas on february   and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf  and this issue presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
this issue should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december   which is our first quarter ended may  upon adoption we are required to reclassify all prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation 
we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our reported results 
related party transaction in october  we entered into a lease agreement with a privately held design technology firm for certain computer aided design software 
we selected this product after an evaluation of competitive products 
table of contents on the strength of its merits 
one of the officers of the design technology firm is the brother of an officer and director of marvell and is also a shareholder of marvell 
the design technology firm was acquired by cadence design systems in december total principal and interest payments over the year term of the lease will be million 
the remaining lease payments as of january  are included in the capital lease commitment table in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed in the overview and liquidity and capital resources sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following additional factors may affect our future results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing  semiconductor and related industries 
we have experienced a recent slowdown in the worldwide economy  which has negatively affected our revenues and results of operations in fiscal if economic conditions worsen  our revenues and results of operations in fiscal and beyond will be materially and adversely affected 
over the last year there has been a slowdown in worldwide economies  including the united states  that has resulted in delays of new orders for our products as well as reschedules of existing orders 
this slowdown has been brought about by a number of factors  including concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence and reports of reduced corporate profits 
if economic conditions worsen  our revenues and results of operations in fiscal and beyond will be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the hard disk drive industry  which is highly cyclical and experiences rapid technological change 
sales to customers in the hard disk drive industry represented approximately  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and the technology changes rapidly 
as a result  this industry is highly cyclical  with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction 
these cycles may affect us as our customers are suppliers to this industry 
hard disk drive manufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction 
in addition  advances in existing technologies and the introduction of new technologies may result in lower demand for disk drive storage devices  thereby reducing demand for our products 
rapid technological changes in the hard disk drive industry often result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s participants 
if the hard disk drive manufacturers supplied by our customers do not retain or increase market share  our sales may decrease 
our galileo subsidiary is incorporated under the laws of  and its principal offices are located in  the state of israel and therefore its business operations may be harmed by adverse political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
galileo is both incorporated under the laws of and has its principal offices in the state of israel 
in addition  galileo maintains its research and development operations in israel 
thus  galileo is directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
major hostilities involving or within israel could disrupt galileo s research and development and other business operations 
for example  continued hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority in recent months caused substantial political unrest  which could lead to a potential economic downturn in israel 
also  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could reduce galileo s sales and its financial results 
a number of countries restrict business with israel or israeli companies  and if the countries in which galileo s customers or potential customers conduct their businesses adopt restrictive laws or policies toward israel or israeli businesses this could harm galileo s ability to retain or increase its sales 

table of contents we depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of  or a significant reduction or cancellation in sales to  any key customer would significantly reduce our revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
of these customers  samsung accounted for  toshiba accounted for  seagate accounted for and accton accounted for 
sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer  as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets  and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future 
the majority of sales to accton represented designs won by us at companies such as enterasys networks  com and alcatel  which are designed and manufactured in taiwan under odm contracts 
the loss of any of our largest customers  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  or any problems we encounter collecting amounts from them would likely seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products 
in the future  these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all  to purchase fewer products than they did in the past  or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way  particularly because we do not have any long term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers or exclusive arrangements with any customers  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty  our customers purchase integrated circuits from our competitors  and our customers may discontinue sales in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner  our operating results and competitive position will be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability  in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products for the broadband communications market and to introduce enhancements to our products for the storage market 
we must also achieve market acceptance for these products and enhancements 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance for new and enhanced products  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will suffer 
the development of our products is highly complex 
we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  and we could experience delays in the future 
in particular  we have a limited history in developing products for the broadband communications market and may encounter technical difficulties in developing wireless lan or other products for this market that could prevent or delay their successful introduction 
unanticipated problems in developing broadband communications products could also divert substantial engineering resources  which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements for the storage market  and could substantially increase our costs 
even if the new and enhanced products are introduced to the market  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of these products in a timely manner 
successful product development and market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including timely and cost effective completion and introduction of new product designs  adoption of our products by customers that are among the first to adopt new technologies and by customers perceived to be market leaders  timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers products  
table of contents the level of acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers  cost and availability of foundry  assembly and testing capacity  availability  price  performance  power  use and size of our products and competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers and strategic partners  and our ability to predict and respond to changes in technology  industry standards or end user preferences 
our acquisition of galileo and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
these acquisitions could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of possible concurrent issuances of dilutive equity securities 
in addition  the purchase price of such acquired businesses may exceed the current fair values of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
as a result  we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could result in significant impairment charges and amortization expense in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results 
we acquired galileo technology ltd 
on january  we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of galileo s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired from our acquisition of galileo has been recorded as goodwill  other intangible assets and deferred stock based compensation 
the acquisition of galileo resulted in goodwill of approximately billion  other intangible assets of approximately million and deferred stock based compensation of approximately million 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was being amortized over its estimated economic life of five years and other intangible assets were being amortized over their estimated economic lives of between five and ten years 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized over the remaining option vesting periods of no more than four years 
upon adoption of sfas  goodwill and the acquired workforce are no longer amortized  but are instead subject to annual impairment reviews 
also upon adoption of sfas  the estimated useful life of the galileo trade name was changed from ten years to five years 
after the adoption of sfas  we will continue to record significant amounts of amortization expense over the estimated economic lives of our intangible assets and over the remaining option vesting periods  which will have a significant negative impact on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we are required to review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis 
over the last year  there has been a slowdown in worldwide economies  including the united states  which has affected our business 
end customers for our products have slowed their purchases of next generation technology and have delayed or rescheduled existing orders for products that incorporate our technology 
as part of the process of adopting sfas  we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill 
if the economic downtrend continues or if other presently unforeseen events or changes in circumstances arise which indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to perform impairment reviews of these assets  which have carrying values of approximately billion as of january  an impairment review could result in a write down of these assets to their fair values 
in light of the large carrying value associated with our goodwill and intangible assets  any write down of these assets may result in a significant charge to our statement of operations in the period any impairment is determined and could cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase or maintain revenue and market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  our market share and revenues may not increase or may decline 
in addition  most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than us 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than us 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than us  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
in addition  new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge 
we expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors  other manufacturers and designers of integrated circuits  and innovative start up integrated circuit design companies 
many of our customers are also large  established integrated circuit suppliers 
our sales to and support of such customers may enable them to become a source of competition to us  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the broadband communications market  we face competition from a number of additional competitors who have a longer history of serving that market 
many of these competitors have more established reputations in that market and longer standing relationships with the customers to whom we sell our products  which could prevent us from competing successfully 
competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices and lower our margins 
due to our limited operating history  we may have difficulty in accurately predicting our future sales and appropriately budgeting for our expenses  and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rate 
our limited operating experience  combined with the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we sell our products  limits our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
additionally  because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future sales growth 
if our sales do not increase as anticipated  significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 
although we have experienced sales and earnings growth in prior quarterly and annual periods  we may not be able to sustain these growth rates  particularly in the period of economic slowdown we are currently experiencing 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 
because we do not have long term commitments from our customers  we must estimate customer demand  and errors in our estimates can have negative effects on our inventory levels  sales and operating results 
our sales are made on the basis of individual purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we have historically placed firm orders for products with our suppliers up to weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to receiving an order for the product 
therefore  our order volumes are based on our forecasts of demand from our customers 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would harm our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
on occasion  we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders  and therefore  were unable to benefit from this increased demand 

table of contents we rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products  and the failure of any of these third party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited testing facilities 
therefore  we must rely on third party vendors to manufacture  assemble and test the products we design 
we currently rely on tsmc to produce substantially all of our integrated circuit products 
we also currently rely on tsmc and other third party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble  package and test our products 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  our relationships with our customers could suffer  our sales could decrease and our growth could be limited 
other significant risks associated with relying on these third party vendors include our customers or their customers may fail to approve or delay approving our selected supplier  we have reduced control over product cost  delivery schedules and product quality  the warranties on wafers or products supplied to us are limited  and we face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we currently do not have long term supply contracts with any of our third party vendors 
therefore  they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantities  or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
none of our third party foundry or assembly and test subcontractors have provided contractual assurances to us that adequate capacity will be available to us to meet future demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with these foundries may cause these foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers  decreasing the capacity available to us 
if we need another integrated circuit foundry or assembly and test subcontractor because of increased demand or the inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers at the time  we might not be able to develop relationships with other vendors who are able to satisfy our requirements 
even if other integrated circuit foundries or assembly and test subcontractors are available at that time to satisfy our requirements  it would likely take several months to acquire a new provider 
such a change may also require the approval of our customers  which would take time to effect and could cause our customers to cancel orders or fail to place new orders 
if our foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality  our relationships with our customers and our reputation will be harmed 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields 
changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
poor yields from our foundries  or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems  harm our financial results and result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
in addition  defects in our existing or new products could result in significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 

table of contents we depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of dr 
sehat sutardja  our co founder  president and chief executive officer  dr 
pantas sutardja  our co founder and vice president  and weili dai  our co founder and executive vice president 
we do not have employment contracts with these or any other key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
there is currently a shortage of qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and sales of integrated circuits for use in communications products 
in particular  there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacture of products based on analog technology  and competition for these engineers is intense 
our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth 
our rapid growth has strained our resources and our inability to manage any future growth could harm our profitability 
our rapid growth has placed  and any future growth of our operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems 
we also expect that we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  our operating results could be harmed 
we are currently in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
an erp system implementation is a very complex  costly and time consuming process 
any unforeseen delays or difficulties in the system implementation may divert the attention of management and other employees and disrupt our ongoing business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space at rates that will cover our lease cost  we will be required to record a period charge for the difference between the total actual or estimated sublease income and our lease cost 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with yahoo inc to lease a building in california consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease began on january  and continues through march  total rent payments over the term of the lease will be approximately million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we intend to consolidate our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the lease on one of our existing facilities expired in february  but we have ongoing  non cancelable leases for the two other facilities 
we are currently attempting to secure subtenants for the remainder of our lease terms for these two facilities 
if we are not successful in subleasing these two facilities at rates that will cover our lease cost  we will be required to record a period charge for the difference between the total actual or estimated sublease income and our lease cost 
in addition  we will continue to be required to pay the full amount of our contracted lease payments while the facilities are vacant or while they are subleased at lesser rates 
the future minimum leases payments for the two unoccupied facilities total million 

table of contents we face foreign business  political and economic risks  which may harm our results of operations  because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states and  as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within taiwan  and our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the pacific rim region 
in addition  many of our customers are located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  which further exposes us to foreign risks 
sales to customers located in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our manufacturing  assembly  testing and sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays  difficulties of managing distributors  especially because we expect to continue to increase our sales through international distributors  political and economic instability  including hostilities and political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  and inadequate local infrastructure 
because all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  potentially leading to a reduction in sales and profitability for us in that country 
a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates for those foreign currencies 
in the past  the state of california has experienced electricity shortages that have resulted in corresponding increases in prices and rolling blackouts 
if electricity shortages occur in the future  our research and development and other operations may be negatively affected 
in the past  the state of california has experienced electricity shortages that have resulted in corresponding increases in prices and rolling blackouts 
during fiscal  this resulted in one instance in which we were subjected to a rolling blackout 
when we are subjected to rolling blackouts  all electricity to our facilities is cut off and we are unable to use our computers  telephones and other equipment that is critical to our research and development and other functions 
some of our customers who have operations in california were also negatively affected by the electricity shortage 
if we are subjected to a series of rolling blackouts or to a single extended rolling blackout as a result of any future electricity shortages in california  our research and development and other operations will be negatively affected 

table of contents our third party foundries and subcontractors are concentrated in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim  an area subject to significant earthquake risks 
any disruption to the operations of these foundries and subcontractors resulting from earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  which is located in taiwan 
currently our only alternative manufacturing sources are located in taiwan and china 
in addition  substantially all of our assembly and testing facilities are located in singapore  taiwan and the philippines 
the risk of an earthquake in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
in september  a major earthquake in taiwan affected the facilities of several of these third party contractors 
as a consequence of this earthquake  these contractors suffered power outages and disruptions that impaired their production capacity 
in march  another major earthquake occurred in taiwan 
although our foundries and subcontractors did not suffer any significant damage as a result of this most recent earthquake  the occurrence of additional earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms  if at all 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
we sell our communications products to customers primarily through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
our relationships with some of our distributors and manufacturers representatives have been established within the last year  and we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our manufacturers representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products 
our representatives and distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives or recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the loss of one or more of our distributors or manufacturers representatives could harm our sales and results of operations 
we generally realize a higher gross margin on direct sales and from sales through manufacturers representatives than on sales through distributors 
accordingly  if our distributors were to account for an increased portion of our net sales  our gross margins may decline 
any future acquisitions and transactions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
any transactions or relationships will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered with those matters 
risks that could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition include  among other things the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired businesses  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  
table of contents the potential inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of us as a result of an acquisition  the potential difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel  the risk of entering market segments in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger market segment positions  and the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing our costs  or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits 
we expect that our gross profits on our storage products are likely to decrease over the next fiscal year below levels we have historically experienced due to i pricing pressures from our customers and ii an increase in sales of socs  which typically have lower margins than standalone read channel devices 
in addition  if our sales of storage products into the desktop computer market were to increase as a percentage of total storage revenues  our margins would also likely decrease because gross margins on sales into this market are generally lower than for sales into the enterprise and mobile computer markets  where we currently generate the substantial majority of our storage product revenues 
additionally  because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  and our costs may even increase  which could also reduce our margins 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we expect that we will have to do so again in the future 
we have a lengthy and expensive storage product sales cycle that does not assure product sales  and that if unsuccessful  may harm our operating results 
the sales cycle for our storage products is long and requires us to invest significant resources with each potential customer without any assurance of sales to that customer 
our sales cycle typically begins with a three to six month evaluation and test period  also known as qualification  during which our products undergo rigorous reliability testing by our customers 
qualification is typically followed by a to month development period by our customers and an additional three to six month period before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
this lengthy sales cycle creates the risk that our customers will decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits 
during our sales cycle  our engineers assist customers in implementing our products into the customers products 
we incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as part of this process  and this process may never generate related revenues 
we derive revenue from this process only if our design is selected 
once a customer selects a particular integrated circuit for use in a storage product  the customer generally uses solely that integrated circuit for a full generation of its product 
therefore  if we do not achieve a design win for a product  we will be unable to sell our integrated circuit to a customer until that customer develops a new product or a new generation of its product 
even if we achieve a design win with a customer  the customer may not ultimately ship products incorporating our products or may cancel orders after we have achieved a sale 
in addition  we will have to begin the qualification process again when a customer develops a new generation of a product for which we were the successful supplier 

table of contents also  during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our integrated circuits 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both our customers mature and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product may cause the customer to lose sales  which would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinued mature product 
in addition  customers may defer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit industry 
the current and any future downturns will likely reduce our revenue and result in excess inventory 
the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced  and is currently experiencing  significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both integrated circuit companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
the current downturn and any future downturns may reduce our revenue or our percentage of revenue growth on a quarter to quarter basis and result in us having excess inventory 
furthermore  any upturn in the integrated circuit industry could result in increased competition for access to third party foundry  assembly and test capacity 
when demand for foundry capacity is high  we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity  which may be costly and harm our operating results 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
in order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high  we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results  including option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  and other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and any arrangements may be costly  reduce our financial flexibility  and not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
the development and evolution of markets for our integrated circuits are dependent on factors  such as industry standards  over which we have no control 
for example  if our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our sales would suffer 
the emergence of markets for our integrated circuits is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
in particular  our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards 
our customers may not adopt or continue to follow these standards  which would make our products less desirable to our 
table of contents customers and reduce our sales 
also  competing standards may emerge that are preferred by our customers  which could also reduce our sales and require us to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
we have made a significant investment in the development and production of our gigabit ethernet products 
however  the gigabit ethernet technology is relatively new compared to the more established and megabit per second fast ethernet technologies 
if the gigabit ethernet technology does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we have also made a significant investment in the development of wireless lan products based on the ieee b standard 
wireless lan technologies are relatively new and many competing standards  such as ieee a and bluetooth tm  exist 
if the b standard does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages results from our collection of proprietary technologies that we have developed since our inception 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed  which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
we have been issued several united states patents and have a number of pending united states patent applications 
however  a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the integrated circuit industry  where a number of companies aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to protect their patent portfolios 
from time to time we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
these claims could result in litigation which  in turn  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  pay damages to the party claiming infringement  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 

table of contents we are incorporated in bermuda  and  as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda 
as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to effect service of process within the united states upon us  or to enforce against us in united states courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
most of our executive officers and directors are residents of the united states 
however  there is significant doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or hear actions brought in bermuda against us or those persons based on those laws 
the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not be automatically enforceable in bermuda 
our bye laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors  which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under bermuda law 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers and directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties with or for us  other than with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver will limit the rights of our shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act complained of involves actual fraud or dishonesty 
thus  so long as acts of business judgment do not involve actual fraud or dishonesty  they will not be subject to shareholder claims under bermuda law 
for example  shareholders will not have claims against officers and directors for a breach of trust  unless the breach rises to the level of actual fraud or dishonesty 
we are subject to uncertainty regarding how the united states federal income tax laws apply to our business 
if our application of the tax code is incorrect  our operating results could be harmed 
as a bermuda corporation  we are subject to united states federal income tax at regular corporate rates and to united states branch profits tax  in each case to the extent that our income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
the determination of whether income of a foreign corporation is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states and  therefore  is subject to united states tax  involves a consideration of all the facts and circumstances and the application of legal standards that are uncertain 
there have been few court cases or rulings by the internal revenue service addressing the application of these legal standards  and we believe that none of these cases or rulings relate to facts precisely like ours 
our position is that our business operations do not generate any income that is effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
because of the uncertainty as to how united states federal income tax laws apply to the way we conduct our business  we believe the internal revenue service may disagree with our past or future positions as to the amount of effectively connected income that we earn 
therefore  if our positions are disallowed  the amount we have accrued in our financial statements for united states federal income taxes may be insufficient to the extent of the difference between the income tax rate ultimately determined to apply and the tax rate that we have used to accrue for income taxes in our financial statements 
in addition  we could be required to make significant cash payments for back taxes and interest based on the difference between the income tax rate ultimately determined to apply and the rate at which we paid those taxes 
tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
under current bermuda law  we are not subject to tax on our income or capital gains 
we have obtained from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempt undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an undertaking that  in the event that bermuda enacts any legislation imposing tax computed on 
table of contents income or capital gains  those taxes should not apply to us until march  however  this exemption may not be extended beyond that date 
the economic development board of singapore granted pioneer status to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in july for a period of at least six years  commencing july  as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in singapore during this period will be exempt from the singapore tax rate 
we are required to meet several requirements as to investment  headcount and activities in singapore to retain this status 
if our pioneer status is terminated early  our financial results could be harmed 
the israeli government has granted approved enterprise status to our wholly owned subsidiary in israel  which provides a tax holiday on undistributed income derived from operations within certain development regions in israel 
in order to maintain our qualification  we must continue to meet specified conditions  including the making of investments in fixed assets in israel 
as our tax holidays expire  we expect that we will start paying income tax on our operations within these development regions 
some of our regional tax holidays have already expired and we are currently paying income taxes in these regions 
if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company  our shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
because we are incorporated in bermuda and have operations in the united states  israel and singapore  we are subject to special rules and regulations  including rules regarding a passive foreign investment company  or pfic 
we believe that we are not a pfic  and we expect to continue to manage our affairs so that we will not become a pfic 
however  whether we should be treated as a pfic is a factual determination that is made annually and is subject to change 
if we are classified as a pfic  then each united states holder of our common stock would  upon qualifying distributions by us or upon the pledge or sale of their shares of common stock at a gain  be liable to pay tax at the then prevailing rates on ordinary income plus an interest charge  generally as if the distribution or gain had been earned ratably over the shareholder s holding period 
in addition to the risks related to pfic status  we and our shareholders could also suffer adverse tax consequences if we are classified as a foreign personal holding company  a personal holding company or a controlled foreign corporation 
our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock  and three existing directors  who are also significant shareholders  are related by blood or marriage 
these factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related directors to control the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  approximately of the outstanding shares our common stock 
additionally  sehat sutardja and weili dai are husband and wife and sehat sutardja and pantas sutardja are brothers 
all three are directors and together they held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  if the directors and officers as a group or any of sehat sutardja  pantas sutardja and weili dai act together  they will significantly influence  and will likely control  the election of our directors and the approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
in addition  the voting power of these officers or directors could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire 
under bermuda law all of our officers  in exercising their powers and discharging their duties  must act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and exercise the care  diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
majority shareholders do not owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders 
as a result  the minority shareholders will not have a direct claim against the majority shareholders in the event the majority shareholders take actions that damage the interests of minority shareholders 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda  except the bermuda courts would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in our name if the directors or officers are alleged to be acting beyond our corporate power  committing illegal acts or violating our memorandum of association or 
table of contents bye laws 
in addition  minority shareholders would be able to challenge a corporate action that allegedly constituted a fraud against them or required the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
on july   a putative class action suit was filed against two investment banks that participated in the underwriting of our initial public offering  or ipo  on june  that lawsuit  which did not name marvell or any of our officers or directors as defendants  was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
plaintiffs allege that the underwriters received excessive and undisclosed commissions and entered into unlawful tie in agreements with certain of their clients in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of thereafter  on september   a second putative class action was filed in the southern district of new york relating to our ipo 
in this second action  plaintiffs named three underwriters as defendants and also named as defendants marvell and two of our officers  one of whom is also a director 
relying on many of the same allegations contained in the initial complaint in which marvell was not named as a defendant  plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated various provisions of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in both actions  plaintiffs seek  among other items  unspecified damages  pre judgment interest and reimbursement of attorneys and experts fees 
these two actions relating to our ipo have been consolidated with hundreds of other lawsuits filed by plaintiffs against approximately underwriters and approximately issuers across the united states 
to date  there have been no significant developments in the consolidated litigation 
it is expected that a small number of cases will be designated as test cases for purposes of initial challenges to the pleadings  which are not expected to be briefed  argued and decided before mid we believe that the claims asserted against marvell and our officers are without merit and intend to defend these claims vigorously 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of the lawsuit naming marvell and our officers will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition 
however  these claims and any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the integrated circuit industry and other technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price 
a substantial number of our shares remain available for sale pursuant to rule future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline 
as of march   we had  shares outstanding and none of these shares are subject to any lock up agreements 
the market price of our stock could drop significantly if holders of a substantial number of our shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
in addition  the sale of our shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control  even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders 
our bye laws contain change in corporate control provisions which include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  and requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve any change of corporate control 

table of contents these change in corporate control provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline  while variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities including money market funds  corporate debt securities  state  county and municipal debt securities  and foreign government securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of january  in thousands 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
expected fiscal year maturity date total fair value variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying balance sheets and are accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations on these companies 
since our initial investment  one of these equity investments in a privately held company has become marketable upon the investee completing an initial public offering 
such an investment is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
this investment is recorded at market value and is classified as a short term investment in the accompanying balance sheets 
foreign currency exchange risk 
all of our sales and the majority of our expenses to date have been denominated in united states dollars  and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures in the future
