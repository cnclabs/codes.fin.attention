item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a worldwide leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and service of process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
process control metrology is used to monitor process parameters in order to enable semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high yields on the production lines  reduce feature size  increase wafer size  increase equipment productivity and improve device performance 
our metrology systems are used in all sections of the semiconductor fabrication plant  or fab  to control the wafer fabrication processes 
examples of wafer fab processes  in which our metrology systems supply key information  are photoresist processing to support lithography  deposition of insulator and conductor films  patterned removal  or etching  of insulator and conductor films  ion implantation and chemical mechanical planarization 
we currently sell five product families of process control metrology systems therma probe systems  opti probe systems  opti probe cd systems  meta probe systems  and sensys and integra integrated metrology systems 
therma probe product family 
therma probe systems utilize our proprietary thermal wave technology and are the predominant non destructive process control metrology systems used to measure the critical ion implantation process on product wafers in the fabrication of semiconductors 
opti probe product family 
opti probe film metrology systems provide the industry s most powerful capability to control and diagnose non opaque films for semiconductor production 
this unsurpassed metrology power is achieved by successfully integrating different measurement technologies  including optical technologies that are proprietary to therma wave  into each opti probe system 
opti probe cd product family 
opti probe cd systems measure the lateral dimensions  or critical dimensions or cd  using a revolutionary  nondestructive technique based on spectroscopic ellipsometry 
these systems are capable of providing cd metrology for the smallest features of the next several generations of ic s 
sensys and integra product family 
the sensys and integra line of integrated metrology products is a broad based family of compact metrology modules which are installed and function inside an ic process system  such as an etching system or cvd deposition system  to provide metrology on each wafer before it exits the process tool 
in january  we acquired sensys instruments corporation  or sensys  a developer of integrated metrology systems 
we are now merging our integra product line with the sensys product family 
meta probe product family 
meta probe thin film measurement systems employ a patented x ray reflectometry technique to rapidly measure thickness  density  and roughness of each film in multi layer stacks 
this system provides metrology for opaque films eg  metal films which cannot be measured with opti probe systems  and which are key for ic interconnect processing 
during fiscal year  the demand for our products decreased significantly as semiconductor manufacturers sharply reduced capital expenditures 
the decrease in capital expenditures resulted in slower bookings and significant order push outs and cancellations of our products in fiscal year in addition to the changes in the business cycle impacting demand for our products  we have seen a shift of net sales from mm to mm products 
in fiscal year  mm products comprised virtually all of our net sales 
during fiscal years and  our customers added significant capacity in mm and in response we increased production of our related products 
meanwhile  we continued to develop updated versions of these products 
as a result  the severity and quickness of the recent downturn in the semiconductor business cycle left us with substantial inventory for our older mm products 
we do not believe that our customers will continue to purchase older versions of our mm products at the previous high rate but expect that sales of mm products will dominate our revenue when capital spending increases during the next industry upturn 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded charges for obsolete and excess inventories of million 
the charges were significantly higher than the normal level and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand  including reduced demand for our older technology mm products 
in january  we completed the acquisition of sensys  whereby sensys became a wholly owned subsidiary of therma wave  focusing on integrated metrology applications and developing business with process tool equipment suppliers 
the sensys product lines include cms  a compact metrology system for cmp applications and cd i  a high throughput  small foot print system for optical cd applications 
the therma wave integra products  including the ix se  will be integrated into sensys business operations 
sensys has developed integration relationships with at least three leading major equipment suppliers to the semiconductor industry involving lithography track  cmp  etch and cd sem equipment 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we derive our revenues from system sales  which have historically consisted primarily of our therma probe and opti probe systems  sales of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
the fluctuations in these percentages are related primarily to the upturns and downturns of the semiconductor industry 
sales of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts tend to reflect more on the installed base of systems previously sold than on current system sales  and therefore  the dollars of such sales do not fluctuate as widely as systems sales 
that causes the percentage of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts sales to be higher in downturns and lower in upturns 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
although we have not been negatively impacted in the past by foreign currency changes in japan  korea  taiwan and europe  such conditions could negatively impact our international sales in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  in process research and development  or ipr d  intangible assets and goodwill  inventories  income taxes and installation and warranty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
effective april   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
historically  revenue from systems and spare parts was generally recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue on service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized 
under sab  equipment sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangement sales that require the deferral of a significant portion of revenue in the amount of the greater of fair market value of installation and a percentage of payment subject to final acceptance 
the total revenue is allocated to each component of the multi element arrangement 
revenue on each element is recognized when the contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained if applicable 
freight terms of all standard product sales are fob shipping point unless otherwise negotiated and agreed in written form between our customers and us 
shipments typically are made in compliance with shipment requirements specified in our customer s purchase order 
revenue on new products is recognized upon customer final acceptance 
where the customer has the right to return the product  the revenue is not recognized until all of the following conditions have been evidenced after the customer s purchase order has been fulfilled the right of return has expired and any potential returns would require authorization by therma wave under warranty provisions  the price of the sales is fixed and determinable  the payment terms are fixed and enforceable 
we monitor and track the amount of product returns and reduce revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
we make estimates evaluating an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
in process research and development 
we value tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions at fair value including ipr d 
we determine ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expense ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
during fiscal  we expensed approximately million in ipr d charges in connection with the sensys acquisition because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if we acquire other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review of such assets include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
we have adopted the non amortization provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and we will not amortize approximately million of goodwill arising from the sensys acquisition 
we will apply sfas no 
in its entirety beginning april  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations and expect to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on its product demand forecast 
as demonstrated during fiscal  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
we recorded special charges for excess and obsolete inventories of million in the fourth fiscal quarter of the charges were significantly higher than the normal level and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
a significant increase in the demand for our product could result in a short term increase or decrease in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we cannot conclude  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
at march   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively that were fully reserved and therefore are not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
warranty 
we provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time  on systems and parts for material and labor to repair and maintain the equipment 
we record the estimated cost of systems and parts warranty upon recognition of revenue  based on the average historical warranty expense for a specific tool 
should actual costs or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets  and is effective for our fiscal year beginning april  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flow 
results of operations the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended march sab sab net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development severance charge stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense interest income other income expense income loss before provision for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and extraordinary charge cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes extraordinary charge net income loss fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
both fiscal and fiscal results reflect our adoption of sab under sab  a portion of revenues are deferred until installation is complete and the customer accepts the system 
deferred revenue relative to service contracts is recognized over of the life of the related service contract 
compared to fiscal  net revenues decreased million or 
the decrease in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the capital spending reductions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the cyclical downturn of semiconductor manufacturers and the weakness of the global economy 
revenues decreased primarily due to decreased units sold of both our therma probe and opti probe products 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment experienced a steep cyclical downturn during our fiscal year just ended 
as a result  we experienced low order booking rates  which is expected to continue into the near future 
fewer orders  combined with rescheduling of delivery and order cancellations  resulted in lower revenues and gross profits that materially adversely impacted our financial positions and results of operations 
our fiscal fourth quarter orders and revenues were improved over our fiscal third quarter  indicating that we may have reached the bottom of the cyclical downturn 
we presently expect that revenues will improve gradually over the quarters in fiscal year however  due to uncertainty as to customer acceptance  market response to our newly introduced product and revenue recognition of our new products  we can give no assurance that we will be able to meet our revenue expectations 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the substantial decrease in gross profit in fiscal was primarily because of lower revenue  a substantial increase of inventory reserves  and lower production volume  which was inadequate to absorb manufacturing overhead 
we increased inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charges were significantly higher than the normal level and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
during fiscal  we did not reduce our manufacturing overhead enough to compensate for the decrease in revenues compared to fiscal we believe that reducing overhead drastically would prevent us from being ready to benefit from the next upturn in the semiconductor industry 
research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  representing an decrease in fiscal of million  or from fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the decrease of absolute dollars from the prior year is primarily the result of reductions in patent defense expense  contract labor and discretionary expenses 
we believe that technological leadership is essential to strengthen our market position in the next economic upturn and expect to continue to commit significant resources to the development of new products and the continuous improvement of existing products 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to decreased headcount as well as decreased sales expenses  such as sales commissions  related to decreased revenues 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal decreased million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels in fiscal in process research and development 
in january  we acquired sensys in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
we believe this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal severance charge 
during fiscal  we recorded million in severance charges as we reduced our workforce by approximately people to reduce operating costs 
in fiscal  we accrued a million severance charge due to the retirement of our former chairman and chief technical officer  dr 
allan rosencwaig 
stock based compensation 
as part of the acquisition of sensys  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million in our fiscal fourth quarter  or of revenue for the quarter 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income expense  net 
total other income for fiscal was million  compared to million of total other income in fiscal a million charge was recorded as other expense in fiscal in connection with the settlement of patent lawsuits with kla tencor 
interest income included in the total other income of fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in interest rate 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded a million benefit for income taxes due to a change in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses for five years instead of two years under the previous law 
for fiscal  we recorded a million provision for income taxes 
net income loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  as compared to net income of million for the prior fiscal year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily a result of decreased revenue  lower gross profit margin and charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter of of million for the write off of acquired ipr d and million additional reserves for obsolete and excess inventories 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
fiscal results reflected our adoption of sab prior periods have not been restated for sab under sab  a portion of revenues are deferred until installation is complete and the customer accepts the system 
deferred revenue relative to service contracts is recognized over of the life of the related service contract 
compared to fiscal  net revenues increased million or 
the increase in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the improved conditions experienced in the semiconductor capital equipment industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the growth of semiconductor manufacturers and the recovery of economic conditions in the asia pacific region 
revenues increased primarily due to increased units sold of both our therma probe and opti probe products 
revenue from spare parts and service contracts has also increased as our customer base continues to expand 
during fiscal year  we received record orders for both our mm and mm product lines which resulted in the increased revenue and backlog 
the mm product lines continued to grow as a percentage of our product mix 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
due to significant demand from customers in taiwan and stronger economic conditions in the asia pacific region  sales to customers in asia represented approximately and of total net revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
we believe that demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may currently be experiencing a cyclical downturn 
as a result  we may expect lower order booking rates in the near future  relative to those achieved in fiscal fewer orders  combined with rescheduling of delivery  would result in lower net revenue and gross profit that would materially adversely impact our financial positions and results of operations 
the anticipated timing of shipments and customer acceptances of those orders will require us to fill a number of production slots in order to meet our near term sales targets 
additionally  we are currently experiencing an increased level of customer cancellation and rescheduling of deliveries 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure existing production orders  our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted in the near term 
however  due to changes in customer delivery dates and uncertainty as to customer acceptance  we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current or prior sales level 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenue levels 
under sab  we were required to defer a significant portion of our system revenues upon installation and customer acceptance of the systems  but we are not allowed to defer any of the manufacturing cost of those tools 
if revenues and costs had been recorded under our previous methods of accounting for revenue recognition  fiscal gross margin would have been approximately 
research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase in fiscal of million  or from fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the increase of absolute dollars from the prior year is primarily the result of additional resources dedicated to the development of new products 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and expect to continue to commit significant resources to r d projects 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to higher revenue levels 
the increase in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to increased headcount as well as increase in sales expenses related to increased revenues 
severance charge 
a million one time severance charge was accrued in fiscal due to the retirement of our former chairman and cto  allan rosencwaig 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from the prior fiscal year is attributable to the redemption or repurchase of substantially all of our outstanding senior notes in march other income expense 
other income  net for fiscal was million  compared to million net other expense in fiscal interest income generated from our cash balance and short term investment was offset by the million one time charge in the fourth fiscal quarter related to the settlement of patent lawsuits between therma wave  inc and kla tencor 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded a million provision for income taxes 
we did not record any tax provision or benefit in fiscal because we could not conclude that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be fully realizable and had provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
based upon our current evaluation of our loss carry forward potential and research and development tax credit carry forward benefits  we believe our effective tax rate for the fiscal should be approximately 
net income loss 
net income for fiscal was million  as compared to a million loss for the prior fiscal year 
this improvement in fiscal was primarily a result of improved revenue  margin and decreased interest expense 
excluding extraordinary and one time charges  net income for fiscal and would have been million and  respectively 
backlog at march    and  our backlog was million  million  and million  respectively 
our backlog consists of product orders for which a customer purchase order has been received and accepted and which are scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
orders that are scheduled for shipment beyond the twelve month window are not included in backlog until they fall within the twelve month window 
orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer  usually without penalty 
backlog also includes recurring fees payable under support contracts with our customers and orders for spare parts and billable service 
because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders and because our sales will sometimes reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventories 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
over the last three fiscal years  we have funded our operating activities principally from net proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash flow provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to is mainly due to the decrease in revenue and gross profit during fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to is primarily due to the increase in revenues and gross profit versus the prior period 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by investing activities was million  a result of a net decrease in short term investments of million  capital expenditures and other investment of million and cash received from sensys acquisition of million 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal included approximately million for expansion of our clean room at our fremont  california manufacturing facility and million for leasehold improvements to our new sales  marketing and customer support facility in fremont 
cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended march   most of which represented proceeds received during the year from issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  equity incentive plan and for the exercise of warrants in connection with sensys acquisition 
our off balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  leases on office and manufac turing space 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of march  in thousands are as follows payment due by fiscal year total aft er debt  including interest operating leases     in june  we entered into a million loan and security agreement with comerica bank 
in december  we amended this bank credit facility 
as a result of the amendment  the credit extension limit was increased to million from million 
the amended bank credit facility allows us to borrow money bearing interest either at a floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate or at a rate per annum equal to libor plus 
we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the lesser of million or the borrowing base  in each case minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the comerica bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the amended comerica bank credit facility matures on june  as of march   we maintained a million standby letter of credit as required by the lessor of our building and had million of unused borrowing capacity under the amended bank credit facility 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants related to the bank credit facility 
our principal sources of funds have been and are anticipated to be cash and short term investments on hand million as of march   cash flows from operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to meet our current and future financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended march   and related party transactions ms 
talat hasan  senior vice president of therma wave and president and chief executive officer of sensys  is a general partner of hitek venture partners limited partnership  or hitek 
sensys  a wholly owned subsidiary of therma wave  leases from hitek certain facilities occupied by sensys in santa clara  california 
during the period between january   the day we completed sensys acquisition  and march   hitek received  from the lease of such facilities 
as of march   we had  in the aggregate  outstanding loans to management of approximately  the proceeds of which were used to acquire our capital stock and million  the proceeds of which were used to pay certain tax liabilities incurred by certain executives 
the loans used to acquire our capital stock bear interest at the applicable federal rate in effect at the time 
the loans used to pay certain tax liabilities do not bear interest 
the executives have pledged their stock as security for the loans 
in  we entered into an advisory agreement with bain capital inc  a then majority stockholder  pursuant to which bain capital agreed to provide management services 
the management fees incurred  excluding out of pocket expenses  during the fiscal years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
we bought out the seven and one half years remaining in the term of the agreement with million in march item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relations to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of march   our cash included money market securities and commercial paper 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
