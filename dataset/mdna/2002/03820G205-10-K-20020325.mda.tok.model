overview the company was founded in to develop  manufacture  and market automated genetic imaging systems for use in cytogenetic laboratories for cancer testing  prenatal testing and other genetic testing applications 
we sell our products to government and private clinical laboratories  research institutions  universities  and pharmaceutical companies located in the united states  canada  europe  japan and other countries 
we also market imaging systems designed for use in plant and animal genetic research programs 
in addition  we recently introduced and have received fda clearance for a clinical system to detect micrometastatic cancer cells in bone marrow from cancer patients 
this system and its research capabilities assists physicians in determining the initial staging of cancer cases  in detecting disease recurrence and in genetically characterizing cancer cells 
we are headquartered in santa clara  california  and have facilities in league city  texas and the united kingdom 
we are the world s leading provider of automated cytogenetic instrument systems 
our products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force  third party distributors and independent sales representatives 
we employ people worldwide 
we have an installed base of over  instruments in over  laboratories and clinics in more than countries 
our cytovision r  powergene r and quips r systems are widely utilized because of their ability to analyze human chromosome preparations using powerful software classification algorithms and a specialized user interface 
these systems also incorporate the capability to analyze and record images produced by advanced genetic research assays that employ fluorescent in situ hybridization fish or comparative genomic hybridization cgh methods 
our mds tm system combines the ability to find targeted cancer cells using brightfield microscopy techniques with our decade long experience in fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis 
taken together  these technologies allow us to analyze the proteins on or within a cell while simultaneously assessing which genes within that cell have been activated or expressed 
both protein and gene expression data are emerging as required parameters when assessing the precise nature of a given tumor or cancer cell 
gene expression data are increasingly being used to determine appropriate cancer therapies 
we achieved a number of important operational and financial milestones in sales for the year were a record at million  an increase of over our net loss for the year was million  a decrease of million or from the net loss of million recorded in we achieved our first profitable quarter in the fourth quarter of  with a net profit of  in  we expanded the menu of the mds tm system with the introduction of several new applications to assist pathologists in their review of key breast cancer tests 
these new applications included our pathvysion tm digital scoring application that provides the first automated imaging capability to assist in detecting amplification of the her neu gene 
pathvysion is a trademark of vysis  inc used under license by applied imaging 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis 
we expect that operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future and will depend on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  demand for our products  release and acceptance of new systems and new applications  timing of capital equipment orders and shipments  competition and its related pricing pressures  and seasonal factors  many of which are outside of our control

in  other expense amounted to  compared to other income of  in the other expense total for represented a decrease in interest income  increased interest expenses related to higher average borrowings and an increase in foreign exchange losses due to the strength of the us dollar against the british pound 
factors that may affect future results we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the past  and we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the future 
our customers  who are primarily public and private clinical laboratories  research organizations and hospitals  generally operate on annual budgets 
their budgeting cycles and spending practices affect our revenues 
factors that may have an influence on our operating results in any particular quarter include demand for our products  seasonality of our sales  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and the costs and time required for a transition to the new products  timing of orders and shipments for capital equipment sales  our mix of sales between our distributors and our direct sales force  competition  including pricing pressures  timing and amount of research and development expenses  including clinical trial related expenditures  foreign currency fluctuations  delays between our incurrence of expenses to develop new products  including expenses related to marketing and service capabilities  and the timing of sales and payments received for the new products and the uncertainty of fda or other domestic and international regulatory clearances or approvals 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
it is possible that our future operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if our operating results fall below market expectations  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  at december  we maintain our cash equivalents primarily in securities with maturities of days or less 
restricted cash  which collateralizes various credit and bank guarantees in the united kingdom  amounted to million at december  and million at december  including restricted cash collateralizing all bank debt 
the reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was due primarily to the net loss for the year of million 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the million decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to reduced requirements for accounts receivables of million a decrease of million in versus an increase of  in and for inventories of  a decrease of  versus an increase of  reflecting our focus on effective control of these items  and a  reduction in the operating loss for the year discussed above 
these were partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  excluding the effect of the psi purchase 
cash used in investing activities was  in compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in primarily 
this change was primarily due to a decrease in our short term investments of million in versus an increase in our short term investments of  in we invested  in for purchases of capital equipment compared to  in cash provided by financing activities was  in compared to million in we received  from the issuance of common stock in from the exercise of employee stock options compared to million in  primarily from million in net proceeds from a private placement of our common stock in december restricted cash amounted to million at the end of  representing cash collateralizing our bank loans 
this was reduced to  at the end of as we entered into new loan agreements in on december   we completed a private placement of million with the sale of  shares of our common stock to two institutional investors purchasing for five separate funds at a purchase price of per share 
the company received proceeds of million from the private placement net of issuance costs of million 
warrants were also issued to the investors entitling them to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additional shares and warrants may be issuable to the investors under anti dilution provisions of the stock purchase agreement between the company and the investors  and terms of the warrants issued to the investors 
no such additional shares or warrants have been issued 
on july  we acquired the united states based genetic imaging business of psi from international remote imaging systems  inc the consideration paid was  shares of common stock valued at  the assumption of certain liabilities  and potential future cash payments to a maximum of million based on the future performance of the business 
no such performance payments were required in and in november  we raised million of additional equity via a private placement of one million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the investors also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for the company s products 
the price exceeded the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system 
as part of the private placement  we recognized deferred revenue of  to be amortized over months  the term of the distribution agreement 
as of december   the remaining balance of the deferred revenue as a result of this private placement was  we had a pounds  gross and pounds  net unsecured revolving line of credit with an international bank in the united kingdom that expired on march  the international bank subsequently provided us with a pounds  gross and net zero borrowing facility with various renewals through october  the line of credit expired at that time and we had no loans under that facility at december  we collateralize various credit and bank guarantees with cash deposits at the international bank amounting to pounds  at december  in september  we established a million  three year term loan with silicon valley bank svb 
the loan had monthly principal payments of  plus interest at svb prime rate plus one and a quarter percent 
in june  we expanded the loan agreement to include a  revolving line of credit 
we executed a new loan agreement with svb on september  this new facility replaced the three year term loan and the revolving line of credit that had an outstanding balance of million on september  the new loan agreement provides the capability to borrow up to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable and inventories 
at december   we had used million of the facility  with  available but not used 
the interest rate on the new facility was at december   based on the svb prime rate plus percent 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the us corporation and requires the company to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
the company was in compliance with the svb loan covenants through december  in july  we acquired certain cytogenetic instrumentation assets of vysis  inc total consideration paid was  consisting of  shares of the company s common stock  a cash payment of one million dollars and installment payments of  paid july  and  paid january since our formation in july through december  we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue through at least  as we continue the development of our mds tm system  conduct clinical trials required for fda clearance of new products  expand our marketing  sales and customer support capabilities  and add additional administrative infrastructure 
in january  we raised million with a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in addition  in january  we instituted a series of actions to rationalize our operations to provide a lower operating cost while increasing efficiencies 
we are closing our league city  texas office and consolidating our manufacturing and engineering facilities 
this is expected to result in a reduction in our operating expenses of approximately million per quarter  beginning in the second quarter of  with a first quarter restructuring charge estimated at  as a result of these actions  we currently estimate that our capital resources will enable us to meet our short term capital needs through at least however  expenditures required to achieve the company s plans may be greater than projected or the cash flow generated from operations may be less than projected 
as a result  our long term capital needs may require us to seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial amounts of money for research and development  preclinical testing  planned clinical investigations  capital expenditures  working capital needs and manufacturing and marketing of our products 
our future research and development efforts  in particular  are expected to include development of additional applications of our current cytogenetic products and additional applications for the mds tm system  which will likely require additional funds 
the exact timing and amount of spending required cannot be accurately determined and will depend on several factors  including 
progress of our research and development efforts and planned clinical investigations  
competing technological and market developments  
commercialization of products currently under development by us and our competitors  and 
market acceptance and demand for our products 
to the extent necessary  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  you will experience dilution of your holdings in our common stock 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate and acceptable financing is not available  we may have to delay development or commercialization of certain of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize certain of our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize 
we may also reduce our marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to certain of our products 
any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we recognize revenue on product sales upon shipment  provided that  at the time of shipment  there is evidence of contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no significant remaining obligations 
concurrent with shipment  we accrue for expected hardware warranty expenses and establish reserves  based on our historical experience  for product returns 
we establish an accounts receivable allowance for estimated amounts that may not be collectible from customers 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit in  and due to the recording of a valuation allowance as an offset to net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but  instead will be subject to annual impairment tests 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of during  the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january   and has not yet determined what effect  if any  applying those tests will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets become impaired 
at december   the company had million in unamortized goodwill and intangible assets that was being amortized over years at december  any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivatives and financial instruments foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenues and operating expenses in the uk denominated in the respective local currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the u 
k 
denominated in the respective local currency 
instead  we believe that a natural partial hedge exits  because local currency revenues will substantially offset the operating expenses denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
we did not engage in hedging activities in and and  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as a part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risks due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities over three months are considered to be short term investments 
at december   all of the short term investments with a market value of  mature prior to february  the weighted average pre tax interest rate on the investment portfolio is approximately
