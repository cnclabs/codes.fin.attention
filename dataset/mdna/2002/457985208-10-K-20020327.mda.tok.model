item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading risk factors 
general integra is a global  diversified medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices  implants and biomaterials primarily for use in neurosurgery  orthopedics and soft tissue repair 
our business is divided into two divisions integra neurosciences tm and integra lifesciences tm 
integra neurosciences division our integra neurosciences division is a leading provider of implants  devices  and systems used in neurosurgery  neurotrauma  and related critical care and a distributor of disposables and supplies used in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders 
integra neurosciences sells primarily through a direct sales force of more than people in the united states  the united kingdom  germany and france 
integra lifesciences division our integra lifesciences division develops and manufactures a variety of medical products and devices  including products based on our proprietary tissue regeneration technology that are used to treat soft tissue and orthopedic conditions 
for the majority of the products manufactured by the integra lifesciences division  we have partnered with market leaders for the development and marketing efforts related to these products 
these non neurosurgical products address large  diverse markets  and we believe that they can be promoted more cost effectively through leveraging marketing partners than through developing a sales infrastructure ourselves 
we have strategic alliances with ethicon  a division of johnson johnson  the genetics institute division of wyeth  medtronic sofamor danek  and sulzer dental

the purchase price consisted of million in cash and million of assumed indebtedness under a term loan from fleet capital  which was repaid in full in the cash portion of the purchase price was financed in part by affiliates of soros private equity partners llc  through the sale of million of series b convertible preferred stock 
these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition 
the following table provides a comparison of pro forma product sales for the years and as if all acquisitions completed after january  had occurred as of the beginning of that year 
this pro forma product sales data is based upon estimates of product sales generated by the acquired businesses during the period prior to which integra acquired them and does not necessarily represent results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had taken place on the basis assumed above

the increase in product sales was primarily the result of the million in sales of products acquired in  increased sales of the duragen r product  which was launched in the third quarter of  and a full year of sales of the neurocare products  which were acquired in march growth in total revenues and product sales in was led by the integra neurosciences division  which reported an million increase in total revenues to million  a increase over the integra lifesciences division reported a million increase in total revenues to million  a increase over cost of product sales included   and million in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in   and  respectively 
excluding these adjustments  gross margin as a percentage of product sales in would have been 
the continued improvement in gross margins is primarily the result of an improved sales mix of higher margin products and increased capacity utilization in our manufacturing facilities 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net income in was million  or per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million in  or per diluted share  and a net loss of million in  or per diluted share 
included in these amounts are the following significant special items recorded in an million deferred income tax benefit from the reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and an extraordinary loss of  net of tax  from the early retirement of debt  recorded in a million non cash  stock based compensation charge related to the extension of the chief executive officer s employment agreement recorded in operating expenses  a million gain on the sale of product lines  a  charge recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change associated with the adoption of a new accounting policy for revenue recognition  and a million non recurring  non cash dividend related to the beneficial conversion feature of our series c convertible preferred stock when it was issued in march that did not affect the reported net loss for but was reflected in the calculation of net loss per share for  recorded in a million fair value purchasing accounting inventory charge and million of severance costs related to acquisitions recorded in operating expenses  a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of a product line  and a million deferred income tax benefit from the reduction of the deferred tax liability recorded in the neurocare acquisition to the extent that consolidated deferred tax assets were generated subsequent to the acquisition 
as adjusted for the above special items  we would have reported net income of million in  as compared to net income of million in and a net loss of million in the following discussion of divisional financial results excludes corporate general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets  which are not included in the measurement of divisional operating results 
integra neurosciences division in thousands product sales neuro intensive care unit    neuro operating room    other neurosciences products    total product sales    other revenue   total revenue    cost of product sales    gross margin on product sales    gross margin as a percentage of product sales 
research and development expenses    sales and marketing expenses    general and administrative expenses    operating income loss    product sales in the integra neurosciences division increased million in to million  a increase over product sales increased million in to million  a increase over this growth has been generated through acquisitions  new product launches  and increased direct sales and marketing efforts  both domestically and in europe 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales of the duragen r dural graft matrix  the selector r integra ultrasonic aspirator for the ablation of cranial tumors  and our line of intracranial monitoring and drainage products for the neuro intensive care unit have grown particularly well 
in  we launched three innovative new products in the united states 
for the neuro intensive care unit  we launched the licox r brain tissue oxygen monitoring system for continuous monitoring of intracranial oxygen levels and the ventrix r truetech catheter  the only advanced intracranial pressure monitoring and drainage catheter designed to tunnel away from the brain  a proven clinical technique used previously only in fluid filled icp monitoring systems 
both of these products were launched in april for the neuro operating room  we launched the neuragen tm nerve guide for the repair of severed peripheral nerves in october these products generated approximately  in domestic sales in in april  we acquired the licox r product for which we previously had distribution rights in the united states and certain other markets and the dissectron r ultrasonic aspirator for tumor removal 
in december  we acquired the neurological disposables and supplies business of neurosupplies  inc sales of these products excluding sales of the licox r product in those markets where we previously had distribution rights totaled million in future sales growth is expected to be driven by our planned increase in the domestic sales force  the continued implementation of our direct sales strategy in europe and from the recently launched and acquired products 
cost of product sales included   and million in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in   and  respectively 
excluding these adjustments  gross margin as a percentage of product sales would have been  and  respectively 
the continued improvement in gross margins is primarily the result of an improved sales mix of higher margin products 
while gross margins on the products that we manufacture are expected to continue to improve in the near term  the lower gross margins from sales of the recently acquired integra neurosupplies business will limit the effect of such expected improvements on overall divisional gross margins 
other revenue consisted primarily of royalties on a product technology obtained in the neurocare acquisition 
other revenue increased  in primarily as the result of a full year of royalty revenues recognized in related to the product technology acquired in other revenue is expected to decrease by  in from the expiration of the related royalty agreement 
research and development expenses increased in primarily related to the development of a new collagen hemostatic device for use in neurosurgical procedures and continued development costs for the neuragen tm nerve guide product 
research and development expenses increased in primarily from the inclusion of the full year of research and development activities from the neurocare acquisition 
research and development expenses represented   and of total product sales in   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses have increased significantly since  consistent with the expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure  increased trade show activities and the opening of a national distribution center in sales and marketing expenses represented   and of total product sales in   and  respectively 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued since the end of  the domestic sales organization has more than doubled to professionals that include neurospecialists  regional managers and clinical educators 
with the acquisitions of gmsmbh and satelec medical in april  we have a direct sales and marketing presence in the key european markets of germany  france and the united kingdom 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to increase in as a result of the planned increase in the domestic direct sales organization to more than professionals and because we will incur the first full year of direct selling expenses in germany and france 
we believe the smaller territories that result from the expansion of the sales force in the united states will allow each neurospecialist to focus more closely on each hospital account 
general and administrative expenses decreased  in bad debt expense was  lower in  primarily as the result of a writeoff of a large distributor account recorded in and improved accounts receivable collections in additionally  general and administrative expenses in included  of consulting fees paid to the seller of the cns business 
general and administrative expenses in included million in severance costs related to the neurocare acquisition 
integra lifesciences division in thousands product sales tissue repair products    other medical devices    total product sales    other revenue    total revenue    cost of product sales    gross margin on product sales    gross margin as a percentage of product sales research and development expenses    sales and marketing expenses    general and administrative expenses    operating income loss    product sales in the integra lifesciences division increased million in to million  a increase over this growth was generated primarily by a million increase in sales of tissue repair products and a  increase in sales of the cryosurgery product line acquired in the second quarter of the increase in sales of tissue repair products was primarily generated by higher sales of the integra r dermal regeneration template and our absorbable collagen sponge for use in orthopedic applications 
product sales in increased million to million  an increase over  primarily from sales of the acquired cryosurgery product line and increased sales of orthopedic products 
partially offsetting this were decreased sales of the integra r product  for which direct sales and marketing activities were transferred to ethicon in june  and decreased sales of a product line disposed of in the first quarter of gross margins have continued to improve primarily as the result of increased capacity utilization and increasing sales of higher margin orthopedic products 
other revenue consists of i research and development funding from strategic partners and government grants  ii license  distribution  and other event related revenues from strategic partners and other third parties  and iii product royalty income 
the decline in other revenue in was primarily the result of million of event related revenues received in  as compared to none in  which was partially offset by higher research and development funding received in other revenue in and includes million per year in research and development funding related to the company s strategic alliance with ethicon 
the ethicon agreement provides us with research funding of million per year through the year after  funding amounts are based on a percentage of net sales of the integra r dermal regeneration template 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although the research  development and distribution agreements with our strategic partners provide us with funding when certain events occur  such as advances in research programs  critical publications or product approvals  the timing of these event payments is uncertain and difficult to predict 
in the first quarter of  we expect to receive an additional  event payment from ethicon for the achievement of a contract goal 
the decrease in research and development expenses in was the result of a decline in costs associated with a program to develop a product to regenerate articular cartilage  partially offset by increased spending on programs with our other development partners 
research and development activities decreased in primarily because of the elimination of several non core research programs throughout and reductions in headcount in our new jersey based research group 
offsetting these decreases were additional research and development activities related to the integra r dermal regeneration template programs 
sales and marketing activities in the integra lifesciences division are primarily the responsibility of our strategic marketing partners and distributors 
sales and marketing costs have decreased since as a result of the transition of integra r dermal regeneration template selling and marketing activities to ethicon in june and lower distributor selling costs in the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in was primarily the result of reduced headcount and the assumption of more administrative responsibilities by the corporate staff 
corporate expenses and amortization in thousands total divisional operating costs and expenses 
   corporate general and administrative expenses 
   amortization   consolidated total operating expenses    corporate general and administrative expenses in included the million non cash  stock based compensation charge related to the extension of the chief executive officer s employment agreement 
excluding this amount  the million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses in resulted primarily from a decrease in legal expenses related to the conclusion of the jury trial in the patent infringement lawsuit against merck kgaa in the first quarter of as well as a reduction in other litigation matters outstanding in  and reduced spending in other corporate functions 
excluding the million stock based charge recorded in  corporate general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to primarily because of increased headcount 
the allocation of the purchase price of business acquisitions has resulted in i acquired intangible assets  consisting primarily of technology  customer lists and relationships  and trademarks  of approximately million  which are amortized on a straight line basis over lives ranging from to years  and ii residual goodwill of approximately million  which has been amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in connection with the implementation in of the recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  this residual goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
the implementation of statement is expected to reduce amortization expense by approximately million per year 
additionally  a further  reduction in amortization expense is expected in related to an intangible asset that was fully amortized at the end of  which will be partially offset by an increase of approximately  from a full year of amortization of intangible assets related to businesses acquired in we reported operating earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million in  as compared to an adjusted million in and an adjusted million in operating ebitda represents operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued non operating income and expenses in august  we raised million from a follow on public offering of million shares of common stock  of which million was subsequently used to repay all outstanding indebtedness 
accordingly  net interest income in increased to million  as compared to net interest expense of  in and net interest income of  in we recorded a million pre tax gain on the disposition of two product lines in and a million pre tax gain on the disposition of a product line in income taxes based upon our recent trend of generating continued taxable earnings  current projections for future taxable earnings  and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences  we concluded in the fourth quarter of that a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences was no longer necessary 
the valuation allowance was reduced by million in because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of that portion of the deferred tax assets recorded at december  the million reduction in the valuation allowance consisted of an million deferred income tax benefit and a  credit to additional paid in capital related to net operating loss carryforwards generated through the exercise of stock options 
a valuation allowance of million is recorded against the million of net deferred tax assets recorded at december  however  we may recognize additional deferred income tax benefit in future periods if we determine that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets can be realized 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through and  respectively 
this partial reduction of the valuation allowance is expected to result in an effective tax rate for integra of approximately in  assuming no further changes in our judgment regarding the realizability of our net deferred tax assets 
however  the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income is expected to substantially reduce the amount of income taxes actually paid 
accordingly  our actual cash tax rate is expected to be in the range through the year the million net tax benefit recorded in is net of million in current income tax expense 
the income tax provision of  recorded in includes  of income tax expense  partially offset by a  benefit from the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards under a state sponsored program 
the income tax benefit of million recorded in consists of a million deferred tax benefit from the reduction of the deferred tax liability recorded in the neurocare acquisition to the extent that consolidated deferred tax assets were generated subsequent to the acquisition 
a tax benefit of  associated with the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards in was offset by  of current income tax expense 
international product sales and operations product sales by major geographic area are summarized below united asia other states europe pacific foreign consolidated in thousands product sales management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  sales to customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product sales  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these sales were generated in foreign currencies from our foreign based subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and france 
our international sales and operations are subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  both in terms of exchange risk related to transactions conducted in foreign currencies and the price of our products in those markets for which sales are denominated in the us dollar 
sales to customers outside the united states and sales denominated in foreign currencies are expected to increase in because of our establishment of a direct sales and marketing infrastructure in the united kingdom  germany and france in and the transfer of certain distributor accounts to our operations in the united kingdom 
in  sales to customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product sales  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these sales were generated in foreign currencies from our subsidiary based in the united kingdom  which was acquired in april in sales outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product sales 
all of these product sales were generated from operations based in the united states and were denominated in us dollars 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of equity securities  product revenues  research and collaboration funding  borrowings under a revolving credit line and cash acquired in connection with business acquisitions and dispositions 
since  we have substantially reduced our net use of cash from operations and  in  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
this positive operating cash flow was reduced by a million use of cash to increase inventory 
inventory levels increased during as part of a planned build up of certain product lines in connection with new product launches and specific sales promotion programs 
we also increased inventories in advance of changes in the manufacturing of certain product lines to ensure that there were no sales disruptions during the transition 
our principal uses of funds in were million for debt repayments  million for business acquisitions  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
principal sources of funds were approximately million from the issuance of common stock and million of positive operating cash flow 
on august   we issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at per share 
the net proceeds generated by the offering  after expenses  were million 
with the proceeds from the public offering of common stock  we repaid all outstanding debt  including million of bank loans and million payable under the terms of a promissory note  in the third quarter of additionally  the related term loan and revolving credit facility with fleet capital was terminated in august at december   we had million in debt outstanding relating to a short term note issued in connection with the integra neurosupplies acquisition in december this note was repaid in full in january at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current investments totaling approximately million 
investments consist almost entirely of highly liquid  interest bearing debt securities 
given the significant level of liquid assets and our objective to grow by acquisition and alliances  our financial position and future financial results could change significantly if we were to complete a business acquisition by utilizing a significant portion of our liquid assets 
in february   our board of directors reauthorized our share repurchase program 
under the program  we may repurchase up to  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million 
shares may be repurchased under this program through december  either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued use of estimates and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns  net realizable value of inventories  estimates of future cash flows associated with long lived asset valuations  depreciation and amortization periods for long lived assets  valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets  loss contingencies  and estimates of costs to complete performance obligations associated with research  licensing  and distribution arrangements for which revenue is accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which form the basis for developing these estimates  are those that are most critical to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future changes to the sales returns and allowances provision 
inventories 
inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out method  or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities  obsolescence or shelf life expiration 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
to the extent that we determine there are excess  obsolete or expired inventory quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant  and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  we perform a recoverability test using projected undiscounted net cash flows applicable to the long lived assets 
if an impairment exists  we calculate the amount of such impairment based on the estimated fair value of the asset 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in january  our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will change to a method based upon a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned with its respective fair value 
we record impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of based upon the fair value of the applicable assets 
if future events that would trigger an impairment review occur or we change our estimates of projected future undiscounted net cash flows related to long lived assets to be held and used  we may need to record an impairment charge 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depreciation and amortization periods 
we provide for depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows 
if our assessment of the useful lives of these long lived assets changes  we may change future depreciation and amortization expense 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our projections for future taxable earnings and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in  this analysis resulted in our reducing the recorded valuation allowance by million 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period we make such a determination 
we would record the adjustment in the earnings of such period or  to the extent the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  as a credit to additional paid in capital 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales when delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  there is a fixed or determinable sales price  and collectibility of that sales price is reasonably assured 
we recognize research grant revenue when the related expenses are incurred 
under the terms of existing research grants  we are reimbursed for allowable direct and indirect research expenses 
we recognize royalty revenue over the period our customers sell the royalty products 
we recognize non refundable fees received under research  licensing and distribution arrangements as revenue when received if we have no continuing obligations to the other party 
for those arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  we recognize revenue using the lesser of the amount of non refundable cash received or the result achieved using percentage of completion accounting based upon our estimated cost to complete these obligations 
if our estimates of the costs to complete these obligations change  we may change the amount of revenue we recognized for fees received under research  licensing and distribution arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees and with respect to our products 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters
