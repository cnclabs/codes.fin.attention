item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

our solutions are designed to accommodate a wide range of customer business needs  technical requirements  and budget objectives through flexible delivery models  including our license  hosted license  hosted subscription  and application service provider asp models 
we offer our products on a license basis  which are marketed primarily to large companies more than  employees that want a highly configurable solution that is managed in house and delivered over a corporate intranet 
we also offer our products on a hosted license and hosted subscription basis  which we market primarily to large companies that want a highly configurable solution provided on an outsourced basis 
we further offer our concur expense product on an asp basis  which we market primarily to mid size companies to  employees that want a standardized solution provided on an outsourced basis over the internet 
we offer our products through a direct sales organization as well as through indirect channels 
we were incorporated in and began selling travel and entertainment expense management software in fiscal in fiscal  we released concur expense  a client server based corporate expense management software product 
in fiscal  we released a browser based version of concur expense  which utilizes corporate intranets to reach employees in an enterprise 
this product has accounted for a majority of concur expense license revenues since its release 
in june  we acquired software  inc  a privately held software company and the developer of concur procurement 
in june  we acquired seeker software  inc  a privately held software company and the developer of concur human resources 
in october  we began offering concur expense as a service on an asp basis  principally to mid size companies that want a standardized solution provided on an outsourced basis over the internet 
in december  we introduced additional outsourced offerings under our hosted license and hosted subscription models principally for large companies that want a highly configurable solution provided on an outsourced basis 
in june  we announced a new operating plan  under which we discontinued concur procurement  discontinued our planned integration of concur human resources with our other products  and announced a workforce reduction to reduce our operating costs 
in march  we sold our concur human resources product line to mbh solutions  inc the transaction consisted of the sale of certain assets to  and assumption of certain obligations by  mbh solutions  inc in exchange for cash consideration to be paid in installments over time 
the transaction resulted in a workforce reduction of employees  the majority of whom continued employment with mbh solutions  inc our primary objective in this sale was to further our focus on the corporate expense management market 
on july   we announced and completed our acquisition acquisition of captura software  inc  a delaware corporation captura 
we have accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
prior to the acquisition  captura was a privately held corporation that provided hosted corporate expense management solutions under license  hosted license  and hosted subscription models 
following the acquisition  captura s operations were consolidated into our operations at our headquarters in redmond  washington 
our integration plan included eliminating redundancies in personnel  equipment  and services to reduce costs for the combined operation 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in addition  we further evaluate and identify on an ongoing basis our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those most important to the financial statement presentation and that require the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions and or conditions  actual results of operations may materially differ 
we periodically re evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and we presently believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  our judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies including american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware eitf  the securities exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and related interpretations including aicpa technical practice aids 
we derive our revenues from the license of our software products  the provision of our software products on a subscription basis under our hosted license  hosted subscription  and asp delivery models  and the provision of software maintenance services  consulting services  and training services 
we recognize license revenues when we obtain a signed contract from our customer  we have delivered the software  the amount of the transaction is fixed or determinable  collectability is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered products or services elements of the arrangement 
our software license contracts typically include an industry standard software performance warranty  for which we provide a reserve based on historical experience 
to date  we have experienced minimal warranty claims 
our software license contracts typically do not include contingencies such as rights of return or conditions of acceptance 
in arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  consulting  or hosting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change prior to market introduction 
we are required to exercise judgments in deciding to how to interpret the evidence of fair value to determine the fair value to allocate to a given element  and in determining whether an established price is likely or not likely to change after market introduction 
these judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 

table of contents fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if we determine the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees is dependent upon the performance of the services  both the software license and the consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
if collectability is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when the fee becomes fixed or determinable 
if unusual extended payment terms are granted  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgments as to whether services should be considered essential to the functionality of licensed software  and the probability of collection and determinability of fees  may materially affect the timing of our revenues and results of operations 
if a non standard acceptance period or non standard performance criteria are required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria or the expiration of the period  if applicable 
in software arrangements where we provide hosting services for the licensed software products  revenues related to all elements of the arrangement are recognized as described above for software license arrangements  so long as the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware  or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software 
we believe that in such arrangements  our hosting services typically meet these criteria 
if our hosting services do not meet these criteria  all revenues related to the arrangement are recognized over the expected lives of the customer relationships  which range from two to five years 
as a result  our judgment as to whether our hosting services meet the criteria above could have a material affect on the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
subscription revenues include the monthly usage fees from asp  hosted license  and hosted subscription services  and the amortization of all associated set up revenues 
the set up fees related to asp services and hosted subscription services  as well as costs incurred directly for this one time set up  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and recognized over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
because our asp and hosted subscription services have been commercially available for only a short period of time  we are currently amortizing these set up fees and the related costs over the contractual lives of the related agreements  which are typically two years for asp services and between two and five years for hosted subscription services 
we will continue to evaluate and adjust this amortization period as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
it is possible  based on that experience  that in the future we will extend the period over which we amortize such set up fees  and therefore  such changes in estimates may affect results of operations 
set up fees related to hosted license subscription services  as well as costs incurred directly for this one time set up  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and then recognized in full upon commencement of such hosting services 
set up fees  net of set up costs and other amounts that are billed to our customers in excess of the amounts currently recognizable  are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we recognize subscription usage fees monthly as the service is provided to the customer 
portions of our asp service revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners  such as adp  inc and microsoft business solutions 
where we assume the majority of the business risks associated with providing asp services  we record the associated revenues on a gross basis with amounts paid to our reseller partners being recognized as cost of sales 
such business risks are evidenced when  among other things  we are responsible for delivery of the service  establish pricing of the arrangement  and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
where the reseller partner assumes the majority of these risks  we record associated asp revenues net of the amounts paid to the reseller partner 
historically  asp revenues generated from sales made through our reseller partners have been primarily recorded on a gross basis 
as a result  our judgment as to whether we have assumed enough risk to record gross revenues may affect how we report revenues and cost of revenues 
sales commissions paid to our channel support personnel are recorded in operations as a sales and marketing expense 

table of contents service revenues consist of fees from software maintenance agreements and consulting services 
maintenance agreements provide for technical support and include the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements to our software products on a when and if available basis 
fees received in advance for maintenance agreements are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet  and recognized ratably over the lives of the related agreements  which are typically one year 
consulting services consist of initial systems implementation and integration of our software products  implementation and integration of upgrades and enhancements to our software products  and other services  such as planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
our consulting services are primarily performed on a time and materials basis 
when we sell our software and consulting services together  we evaluate the consulting services to determine whether they are essential to the functionality of the software 
in our judgment  our services typically are not essential to the functionality of the software  therefore we recognize license revenues as described above  and we recognize consulting service revenues as the services are performed 
accordingly  our judgment as to whether services are essential to the functionality of licensed software  may materially affect the timing of our revenues and results of operations 
in some instances  we have sold our consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts  and in such cases  consulting revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
in addition  we maintain estimated allowances on consulting revenues based on historical collection experience 
bad debts 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of the customer 
our financial statements include reserves against general and administrative expenses for accounts receivable we believe will prove to be uncollectable 
we provide an allowance for bad debts based on historical experience  current and expected economic trends  and specific information about customer accounts 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of intangible assets 
our acquisition of captura resulted in the recording of million in goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  million in acquired in process research and development  and the acquired customer base intangible of million 
we engaged a third party appraiser to perform the valuation of the in process research and development and intangible assets we acquired 
the value of the acquired customer base intangible was based on all captura customer contracts signed as of september   ranging in term from to years  and having an average remaining life of years 
due to captura s limited historical experience  most of the acquired contracts were assumed to renew for one year term 
the future cash flows provided by these contracts are almost entirely subscription based  and as a result  will generate an equal and ratable stream of monthly cash flows 
in the valuation process  a form of the income approach commonly referred to as the excess earnings method  was used to estimate the value of the acquired customer base 
the excess earnings method captures the value of an intangible asset by discounting to present value the earnings generated by the asset that remain after deduction of a return on other contributory assets 
these other assets normally include working capital  fixed assets  and other intangible assets 
the estimated net cash flow attributed to the customer base was discounted to present value 
based on the excess earnings method  the value of the acquired customer base was estimated to be million 
the expected average remaining life of all acquired contracts was estimated to be years 
the valuation of these items may materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which would affect our financial position and operating results 
the value of acquired in process research and development comprised certain elements of captura s technology that were identified as having value for concur s current and future development efforts 
due to the difficulties in estimating the future incremental revenue stream these elements would contribute  the net income valuation approach would not have provided a meaningful result 
therefore  these elements were valued using a hybrid cost savings approach  under which the cost to reproduce the technology was estimated 
this cost was then allocated to the remaining development period required to integrate these elements into concur s future platform 
the tax effected cost savings were then discounted to present value 
this amount was charged to operations as in process research and development costs in the period during which the acquisition occurred 
our valuation may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which would affect our financial position and operating results 

table of contents results of operations revenues years ended september  change change dollars in thousands license subscription service gross revenues sales returns allowances net revenues we derive our revenues from the license of our software products  the provision of our software products on a subscription basis under our hosted license  hosted subscription  and asp delivery models  and the provision of software maintenance services  consulting services  and training services 
license revenues 
license revenues consist of software license fees 
the decrease in license revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of a generally weaker economic environment in fiscal  as well as a growing trend in typical license customers to purchase our solutions on a hosted subscription basis 
the decrease in license revenues in fiscal from fiscal reflects the discontinuation of concur procurement and the sale of concur human resources 
we recorded the sales returns and allowances reserve in fiscal as a result of the discontinuation of concur procurement  and to cover any product returns resulting from that decision 
a small portion of that reserve was reversed as a result of a change in estimate during fiscal subscription revenues 
subscription revenues consist of monthly fees that customers pay for the use of our asp services  hosted license services  hosted subscription services  the amortization of one time set up fees charged in prior periods in connection with those services and recognized over time  and monthly billings and amortization of set up fees related to hosted license services for customers who have elected to have us host and manage their licensed product 
the increases in subscription revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to fiscal  are primarily a result of the increasing size of the customer base contributing to our recurring revenue stream since the launch of our asp services in the first quarter of fiscal  which was driven in part by the introduction of sales through our strategic relationships 
to a lesser degree  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our hosting revenues increased as a result of the acquisition of captura in july in may  we entered into a strategic relationship with adp  inc adp  under which adp markets our asp services to its existing customers and to potential new customers 
sales through this channel commenced in the september quarter of fiscal in july  we amended our agreement with adp to transfer the majority of the business risks associated with any new customers signed through this channel to adp 
as a result we are recording asp revenues from these new unit sales on a net basis 
the majority of new sales of asp services during fiscal occurred through adp 
we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow during fiscal as a result of the continued development of our existing strategic relationships  the introduction of additional strategic relationships  the full year s impact of the captura acquisition  and as we continue to respond to the growing demand for asp services delivered to the large market 
service revenues 
service revenues consist of fees for maintenance  consulting services  and training 
maintenance fees are typically billed annually and amortized over the period of the contract 
the increases in service revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  compared to fiscal  are primarily related to increases in annual maintenance contracts entered into in these periods  which are a direct result of our growing installed customer base 
in fiscal  the increase was offset in part by a reduction in such contracts as a result of the discontinuation of concur procurement and the sale of concur human resources 
we expect future service revenues to fluctuate based on new sales of our products and services and the related consulting and maintenance services provided  as well as the demand for upgrades and enhancements to our products 

table of contents international revenues 
we market our software and services through our direct sales organization in the united states  the united kingdom  and australia  and through strategic referral and reseller arrangements in the united states and in international markets 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
historically  as a result of the relatively small amount of our international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
revenue concentrations 
a substantial amount of our revenues has been derived from the sales of concur expense and related services 
revenues from concur expense and related services represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  compared to approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we anticipate that revenues from concur expense and related services will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in fiscal no customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal   or cost of revenues years ended september  change change dollars in thousands cost of license revenues percentage of gross license revenues cost of subscription revenues percentage of subscription revenues cost of service revenues percentage of service revenues total cost of revenues percentage of gross revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists mainly of royalties for sub licensing third party software  and  to a lesser extent  the costs of manuals  media  and duplication for our licensed products 
the modest decrease in cost of license revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to reduced royalties payable to third parties for sub licensing third party software 
the decrease in cost of license revenues for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was due in part to the amortization of purchased technology  which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and  in part  to a decline in the volume of manuals  media  and duplication expenditures  as well as a decrease in royalties paid to third parties for sub licensed software 
we expect that the cost of license revenues will continue to fluctuate modestly in relation to changes in the overall demand for our license products as well as the cost for sub licensing third party software 
cost of subscription revenues cost of subscription revenues consists mainly of salaries  server costs and storage fees  telecommunication charges  strategic referral and reseller fees  and amortization of deferred set up costs 
to reflect industry standards  we have reclassified certain amounts paid for commissions to our sales personnel from cost of subscription revenues to sales and marketing expense in the current and prior periods 
the cost of subscription revenues for fiscal increased from fiscal  primarily due to increased infrastructure costs to support a larger customer base  such as referral and reseller fees  telecommunication charges  and server storage fees 
to a lesser extent  this increase was also due to growth of amortized setup costs incurred in prior periods and recognized over time  offset slightly by reduced personnel related costs  made possible by improved efficiencies in our asp business 
the cost of subscription revenues for fiscal increased significantly from fiscal  primarily due to our investment in infrastructure to accommodate the current and near term growth of our asp business and  to a lesser extent  the payment of reseller fees associated with the increase in asp sales generated through our strategic partners 
we expect the cost of subscription revenues to grow modestly during fiscal primarily as a result of additional costs related to the support of the captura expense customer base as a result of the acquisition of captura in july of cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes primarily the salaries  benefits  and other expenses associated with employees who provide maintenance  consulting services  and product training 
the decrease in cost of service revenues for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a decrease in consulting services personnel  which was made possible by improvements in our solutions and implementation methodology that enable us to provide consulting services more efficiently 
in addition  this decrease reflects personnel reductions related to our sale of concur human resources  as well as our company wide cost reduction efforts 
the decrease in cost of service revenues for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to continued improvements in our solutions which lead to an overall reduction in our costs to deliver such services  as well as a decrease in professional services personnel relating to our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of concur human resources  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to changes in the level and mix of services provided 

table of contents operating expenses years ended september  change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing percentage of gross revenues research and development percentage of gross revenues general and administrative percentage of gross revenues merger  acquisition  and restructuring charges percentage of gross revenues total operating expenses percentage of gross revenues sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  travel  and facility costs for our sales and marketing personnel and  to a lesser extent  costs of advertising  trade shows  and other promotional activities 
to reflect industry standards  we have reclassified certain amounts paid for commissions to our sales personnel from cost of subscription revenues to sales and marketing expense in the current and prior periods 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing personnel costs  commissions  travel costs  advertising expenses  and recruiting expenses 
these decreases resulted primarily from personnel reductions related to our sale of concur human resources as well as measures taken to increase productivity across the direct sales channel  increased focus on channel sales  reduced advertising  and company wide efforts to reduce costs 
the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to lower personnel costs  advertising expenses  commissions  and travel costs 
these decreases reflect our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of concur human resources  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease slightly in fiscal as a percentage of revenues as a result of a greater portion of new unit sales being generated through our strategic referral partners  as well as our continued efforts to increase productivity across the direct sales channel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  outside contractors  facility costs  and expenses associated with computer software and hardware used in our software development activities 
the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily related to a reduction in the number of outside contractors and employees utilized in software engineering  program management  and quality assurance  which were all primarily due to the sale of our concur human resources product line in march the decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects lower utilization of outside contractors and staffing reductions  primarily due to our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement  the sale of concur human resources and our company wide efforts to reduce costs 
in the development of our new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant  and all costs related to research and development have been expensed as incurred 
in fiscal  we expect our research and development costs to increase modestly as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement to enable us to extend our leadership position in corporate expense management software and services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and related costs associated with personnel in finance  human resources  legal  administration  and facilities  together with the provision for bad debts 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to our company wide efforts to reduce costs  which included reductions in personnel and related costs  amounts incurred for the provision for bad debts  and spending for legal and other third party service providers 
the decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower utilization of contract labor and to a lower provision for bad debts  and  to a lesser degree  reflects lower facility costs and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
these decreases reflect our restructuring and discontinuation of concur procurement in june  the sale of our concur human resources product line in march  and our company wide efforts to reduce costs over both years 
during fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent with fiscal 
table of contents merger  acquisition  and restructuring charges 
acquisition related charges for fiscal consist of a one time write off of acquired in process research and development costs totaling million  as well as  of expense relating to the amortization of the acquired customer base intangible asset in connection with our july acquisition of captura 
restructuring charges for fiscal consist of restructuring costs of  in connection with the sale of our concur human resources product line  offset by a  gain on the sale of these assets  and a  reduction in the amount accrued for our june restructuring as a result of changes in the estimated amounts required for severance and related benefits  facilities  and product marketing commitments 
restructuring and merger charges for fiscal include a charge of million for our restructuring in june  which included amounts for severance and related benefits  facilities  and product marketing commitments  offset by a reduction in the merger costs accrued as a result of a revision in estimated costs of million relating to the acquisition of seeker software in june interest income and interest expense years ended september  change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense interest income and interest expense 
the decreases in interest income in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  compared to fiscal  were due to the decreases in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities upon which we earn interest  and to a lesser extent  to lower interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
the decrease in interest expense in both fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to lower outstanding interest bearing obligations related to bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses since inception that have resulted in deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance

table of contents financial condition our total assets were million and million at september   and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash in our operations during the year  as well as a decrease in the net carrying value of our fixed assets 
these decreases were offset by increases in accounts receivable and intangible assets due to the acquisition of captura 
as of september   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash compared to million at september   representing a decrease of million  or 
our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  was million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase was principally a result of acquisition of captura s accounts receivable as of july   along with subscription billings for captura s customer base during august and september  which amounts are predominantly billed in advance of each quarterly period 
average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days and days for the quarters ended september  and  respectively  and days and days for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily the result of additional subscription billings for the captura customer base outstanding at september   as opposed to only two months of revenue recognized in fiscal for those customers 
we expect that our average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable will be between and days in future quarters  based on current period revenues  the accounts receivable aging  as well as the revenue mix between license  hosting  and asp sales 
our total current liabilities were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease consists primarily of a reduction in accrued payroll and benefits  which was the result of a significant decrease in bonuses earned as of september  this decrease was largely offset by an increase in deferred revenues resulting from growth in subscription services  which includes the addition of captura expense customers  as well as maintenance revenues resulting from the continued growth of our installed license customer base 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser degree  through the use of long term debt and equipment leases 
our sources of liquidity as of september  consisted principally of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash  totaling million 
of that amount   was pledged to secure the lease of our corporate headquarters   was pledged to secure the daily transactions processed in connection with our asp services  and  was pledged to secure an equipment credit facility 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
for such periods  net cash used by operating activities was primarily a result of funding normal  ongoing operations 
our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  and purchases and related maturities of marketable securities 
property and equipment acquisitions  including those acquired under capital leases  totaled million  million  and million in fiscal   and  representing a decrease of million  or in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of million  or in fiscal from fiscal decreased equipment purchases in fiscal and compared to purchase levels in fiscal were primarily the result of increased equipment purchases related to the build out of our hosting infrastructure  a growing employee base for which property and equipment was purchased  and the purchase and implementation of several software programs  all in fiscal our financing activities used million in and million in fiscal and  respectively  and provided million in fiscal the net usage of cash in financing activities in fiscal and was primarily the result of payments made on existing loans and capital leases  offset in part by the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
to a lesser extent  the net usage of cash in financing activities in fiscal was also offset in part by proceeds from borrowings under the equipment credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock 
in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock and received approximately million in cash  net of commissions and other offering costs 

table of contents in march  we established a million equipment credit facility with a bank  pursuant to the terms of a loan and security agreement 
this agreement allows for advances in the amount of actual equipment purchases made through december  up to million 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate less  and the loan matures in december as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement was  thereby leaving additional available borrowings of  on september   we amended the terms of the march loan and security agreement to add captura as a borrower  and to include a term loan whose proceeds were to be used to refinance certain indebtedness owing by captura to another creditor 
the amount of the term loan as of september   was  borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate  and the term loan matures in september under this agreement  there were no additional borrowings available as of september  the following are contractual commitments associated with our debt  lease  and facilities obligations  as of september  fiscal year ending september  total in thousands debt principal and interest capital leases  interest and tax operating leases third party hosting arrangements cash to be paid in the captura acquisition total contractual commitments we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the future  we may seek additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 

table of contents factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves substantial risk and uncertainty 
the following discussion addresses some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause  or contribute to causing  actual results to differ materially from expectations 
in evaluating our business  readers should pay particular attention to the descriptions of risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we rely heavily on sales of one product 
since  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenues from concur expense products and services 
we believe that sales of concur expense will continue to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend upon the successful development  introduction  and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of concur expense and other applications  and our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver the enhancements that customers want with respect to our current and future products 
there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve widespread market penetration or that we will derive significant revenues or any profits from sales of such products and services 
we depend on services revenues  services revenues and services revenue margins may decline 
our services revenues represented of total revenues for fiscal we anticipate that services revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenues 
the level of services revenues depends largely upon demand for our consulting services and ongoing renewals of customer support contracts by our installed customer base 
our consulting revenues could decline if third party organizations such as systems integrators compete with us for the installation or servicing of our products 
in addition  our customer support contracts might not be renewed in the future 
our ability to increase services revenues will depend in large part on our ability to increase the scale of our services organization  including our ability to recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified services personnel 
due to the increasing costs of operating a professional services organization  we may not be able to maintain our current margins in this part of our business 
we depend on subscription revenues  our subscription based delivery models have limited histories 
in fiscal  we began to offer our concur expense software as a subscription service under our internet based asp model and our outsourced hosted license and hosted subscription models to complement our traditional licensing of this product 
in addition  we recently acquired captura  which offered its products primarily as a subscription service under these hosted models 
we offer our asp and hosted models on a subscription basis to companies seeking to outsource their corporate expense management solutions 
these subscription based delivery models have been in operation for a limited period of time and represent a significant departure from the strategies we and other enterprise software vendors have traditionally employed 
we have limited experience selling products or services under these delivery models  and our efforts to develop these models may divert our financial resources and management time and attention away from other aspects of our business 
even if our strategy of offering our products to customers under these models proves successful  some of those customers may be ones that otherwise might have bought our software and services through our traditional licensing arrangements  which is likely to reduce our revenue 
furthermore  our total subscription revenues exceeded our cost of subscription revenues for the first time in the quarter ended june  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain positive gross margins in our subscription based models in future periods 
in addition  captura never achieved positive gross margins from its subscription based models 
to maintain positive margins for our subscription services  our subscription revenues will need to continue to grow more rapidly than the cost of such revenues 
in light of our limited experience with providing subscription services and our reliance on strategic referral partners for marketing purposes  we cannot assure you that such revenue growth will continue at the rates we expect or at all 
if our business for subscription services does not grow sufficiently  we could fail to meet expectations for our results of operations 

table of contents we have become more reliant on revenues generated by our subscription based delivery models 
our subscription revenues represented of total revenues for fiscal we expect this trend to continue  particularly in light of our acquisition of captura 
we generally begin to recognize subscription revenues after our service has been implemented and ratably for the duration of our subscription services contracts 
the cycle for implementing our subscription services can be unpredictable because our service must be integrated with a customer s existing systems or business 
any such delays may prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for periods of time even when we have incurred expenses relating to the implementation of our subscription services 
furthermore  we may experience unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services to customers over the term of our subscription services contracts as a result of inflation  inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors  which may harm our operating results 
additionally  some of our subscription services contracts contain cancellation provisions  and as a result  we may recognize substantially less revenue than the aggregate value of those contracts over their terms 
if a customer cancels or otherwise seeks to terminate a subscription agreement prior to the end of its term  our operating results could be substantially harmed 
we depend on software license revenues  which makes our operating results difficult to predict 
our software license revenues represented of total revenues for fiscal our licensed software products are typically shipped when orders are received  so license backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of the quarter s expected license revenues 
this makes license revenues in any quarter difficult to forecast because they are determined by orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  we have historically recognized a substantial percentage of revenues in the last month of the quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter  and we expect this trend to continue for as long as our licensed software products represent a substantial part of our overall business 
since our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues or any delay in the recognition of revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we find it difficult to forecast quarterly license revenues because our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  is lengthy and varies substantially from customer to customer 
if our revenues fall below our own estimates or below the consensus analysts estimate in an upcoming quarter  our stock price could decline further  harming our business significantly in terms of  among other things  diminished employee morale and public image 
if we do not successfully integrate the operations of captura in a timely manner  we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our acquisition of captura 
to successfully integrate captura  we must be able to operate concur and captura as a single  combined enterprise utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
in addition  we must continue to integrate captura s product development operations  products and technologies with our own 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating captura s operations into our own  including the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns  difficulties in coordinating different product development and engineering teams  and perceived adverse changes in business focus 
in addition  we will need to retain and integrate key research and development personnel 
we will also need to educate our customer service organization regarding our captura products and services 
training our customer service organization will consume additional time and resources  and may not occur rapidly enough to achieve a smooth transition with respect to our efforts to support customers of captura products 
the near term effects of the acquisition may also disrupt our current customer relationships and captura s ongoing customer relationships 
integration of captura s operations may take longer than expected  and we may be required to expend more resources on the integration than anticipated 
the need to expend additional resources on integration may reduce the resources that would otherwise be spent on developing our products and technologies 

table of contents it is important for us to continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships 
to offer products and services to a larger customer base than we can reach through direct sales  telesales  and internal marketing efforts  we depend on strategic referral relationships and reseller relationships 
for example  a significant amount of our new sales of asp services in recent periods occurred through our relationship with adp  inc  one of our strategic partners 
if we were unable to maintain our existing strategic referral or reseller relationships or enter into additional strategic referral or reseller relationships  we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales  and marketing of our products and services 
our success depends in part on the ultimate success of our strategic referral and reseller partners and their ability to market our products and services successfully 
our existing strategic referral partners are not obligated to refer any potential customers to us 
in addition  some of these third parties have entered  and may continue to enter  into strategic relationships with our competitors 
further  many of our strategic partners have multiple strategic relationships  and they may not regard us as significant for their businesses 
our strategic partners may terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products or services 
our strategic partners also may interfere with our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships 
we face significant competition 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the direct competition we face depends on the market segment focus and delivery model capabilities of our competitors 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and  at times  have to overcome their reluctance to move away from existing paper based systems 
overall  we compete primarily with independent vendors of corporate expense management software and services  and with financial institutions and erp vendors that sell products similar to those we sell  along with their suites of other products and services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
some of our competitors  particularly major financial institutions and erp vendors  have well established relationships with our current and potential customers as well as with systems integrators and other vendors and service providers 
these competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products  than us 
in addition  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors in the future 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and must overcome their reluctance to move away from existing paper based systems 
there are risks associated with international operations 
our international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including costs of customizing products for foreign countries  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  dependence on local vendors  uncertain regulation of electronic commerce  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
our international operations also face foreign currency related risks 
to date  most of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars  but we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies 
in particular  we expect that an increasing portion of our international sales may be euro denominated 
the euro is still a relatively new currency and may be subject to economic risks that are not currently contemplated 
we currently do not engage in foreign exchange hedging activities  and therefore our international revenues and expenses are currently subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 

table of contents revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales and marketing activities and enter into relationships with additional international distribution partners 
we are in the early stages of developing our indirect distribution channels in markets outside the united states 
we may not be able to attract and retain distribution partners that will be able to market our products effectively 
we must also customize our products for local markets 
for example  our ability to expand into the european market will depend on our ability to develop a travel and entertainment expense management solution that incorporates the tax laws and accounting practices followed in applicable european countries  and to continue development of our applications to support the euro 
further  if we establish significant operations overseas  we may incur costs that would be difficult to reduce quickly because of employee practices in those countries 
our international operations also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
our revenue recognition policy may change and affect our earnings 
we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards 
however  current software revenue recognition accounting standards  and accounting guidance with respect to such standards  are subject to change 
such changes could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  and such changes could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on third party hosting facility providers for our subscription based delivery models 
in connection with our subscription based delivery models  we have engaged third party hosting facility providers to provide the hosting facilities and related infrastructure for such models 
these providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately 
if any hosting facility provider delivers inadequate facilities  infrastructure  or related service to us  our reputation could be harmed 
security and other concerns may discourage use under our subscription based models 
if customers determine that our subscription based offerings are not scalable  do not provide adequate security for the dissemination of information over the internet or corporate extranets  or are otherwise inadequate for internet or extranet use  or if for any other reason customers fail to accept our subscription services for use  our business will be harmed 
as part of our subscription services  we expect to receive credit card  travel booking  employee  purchasing  supplier  and other financial and accounting data  through the internet or extranets  and there can be no assurance that this information will not be subject to computer break ins  theft  and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information for which we are responsible 
any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation  loss of customers  or other harm to our business 
in addition  any person who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
further  a well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
our failure to prevent security breaches  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents our business is difficult to evaluate and we have a history of losses 
we incorporated in and began licensing our software products in since  our business model and operating plan have evolved significantly 
this limited operating history and evolving business model make our business operations and prospects difficult to evaluate 
investors in our securities should consider all the risks and uncertainties that are commonly encountered by companies in their early stages of business operations  particularly companies  such as ours  that are in new and rapidly evolving industries 
since  we have spent substantial financial and other resources to develop our software products and services and otherwise fund our operations  and we expect to continue to do so to fund our investments in research and development and our other business operations 
our recent acquisition of captura will require us to expend additional financial and other resources  including costs of integration of certain captura employees 
to date  we have incurred net losses in each quarter of operation and have not achieved profitability 
we incurred net losses totaling million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations of investors and public market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter particularly because our products and services are relatively new and our prospects are uncertain 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the evolving demand for our software products and services  spending decisions by our customers and prospective customers  our ability to manage expenses  the timing of new product releases  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the timing of execution of large contracts  changes in mix of our products and services  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  costs of developing new products and enhancements  and  global economic and political conditions  as well as those specific to our customers or our industry 
in addition  due to the continuing slowdown in the general economy  we believe that many existing and potential customers are reassessing or reducing their planned technology and internet related investments and deferring purchasing decisions 
further delays or reductions in business spending for technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
as a result  there is increased uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues 

table of contents we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
in july  we and several of our current and former officers were named as defendants in two securities class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the complaints generally allege claims against the underwriters of our initial public offering in december  our company  and several of our current and former executives  based on alleged errors and omissions concerning underwriting terms in the prospectus for our initial public offering 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek damages in unspecified amounts  which could be substantial 
in april  these lawsuits were consolidated 
in october  the court dismissed the individual defendants from the consolidated lawsuit  without prejudice  pursuant to a stipulated agreement between the parties 
we believe the consolidated lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
any liability we incur in connection with this lawsuit could materially harm our business and financial position and  even if we defend ourselves successfully  there is a risk that management distraction in dealing with this lawsuit could harm our results 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities  as we have experienced from time to time 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
it is important for us to continue to manage changing business conditions 
our future operating results will depend  in part  on our ability to manage changing business conditions  including such conditions as the general economic slowdown  reduced investment in information technology by customers and prospective customers  and reduced business travel 
if we are unable to manage changing business conditions effectively  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to manage our operations with reduced staffing levels may strain our management  financial  and other resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
in the future  we may be required to seek additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
factors such as the commercial success of our existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
we cannot assure you that such funding will be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities  the percentage stock ownership by our existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  such securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential growth  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
our lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our financial results 
because of the high costs involved  customers for enterprise software products typically commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software applications and require us to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of our products and services 
our sales cycle  which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale  is often lengthy and unpredictable 
as a result  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales 
in addition  customers may delay their purchases from a given quarter to another as they elect to wait for new product enhancements 
any delay in completing  or failure to complete  sales in a particular quarter or fiscal year could harm our business and could cause our operating results to vary significantly 
we depend significantly on direct sales 
we sell our licensed products primarily through our direct sales force 
we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need 
if we were unable to hire or retain competent sales personnel our business would suffer 
in addition  by relying primarily on a direct sales model  we may miss sales opportunities that might be available through other sales channels  such as domestic and international resellers and strategic referral arrangements 
in the future  we intend to continue developing indirect distribution channels through third party distribution arrangements  but we may not be successful in establishing and maintaining those arrangements  or they may not increase revenues 
furthermore  we plan to continue using resellers and strategic referral partners to market our asp services in particular 
we have limited experience utilizing resellers and referral partners to date 
the failure to adequately expand indirect channels may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

table of contents our products might not keep pace with technological change 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms  database technology  and electronic commerce technical standards 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements or introductions  or modifications by vendors of operating systems  back office applications  and browsers and other internet related applications  could harm our business 
we rely on third party software that may be difficult to replace 
we rely on software licensed from third parties in order to offer some of our software products 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the loss or inability to maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in the sale of our products and services until equivalent technology is either developed by us  or  if available  is identified  licensed  and integrated  which could harm our business 
we may not successfully develop or introduce new products or enhancements to existing products 
our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in part  upon the successful development  introduction  and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of concur expense and other applications  and our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver enhancements to our current and future products that customers desire 
we have experienced delays in the planned release dates of our software products and upgrades  and we have discovered software defects in new releases after their introduction 
new product versions or upgrades may not be released according to schedule  or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products  or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not deliver new product versions  upgrades  or other enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
we are also continually seeking to develop new product offerings 
however  we remain subject to all of the risks inherent in product development  including unanticipated technical or other development problems  which could result in material delays in product introduction and acceptance or significantly increased costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products  or to introduce in a timely manner and gain acceptance of such new products in the marketplace 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continue to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating  and retaining key personnel 
many of our competitors for experienced personnel have greater financial and other resources than us 
we also compete for personnel with other software vendors and consulting and professional services companies 
further  we believe stock options are an important component for motivating and retaining our key personnel 
the significant decline in our stock price during the past two years has made stock options previously granted with higher exercise prices less valuable to our current employees and has consequently made it more difficult for us to retain our key personnel 
the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel would harm our business 
our ability to protect our intellectual property is limited and our products may be subject to infringement claims by third parties 
we depend upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information 
we presently have no patents or patent applications pending 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting these proprietary rights will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products or other intellectual property rights 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we acquire companies  products or technologies  we may face risks associated with those acquisitions 
we recently acquired captura  and if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we may acquire additional companies or make investments in other companies  products or technologies in the future 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the captura acquisition or future acquisitions or investments to the extent that we anticipate  or at all 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if this acquisition or any future acquisition or investment is not perceived as improving our earnings per share  our stock price may decline 
in addition  we may incur non cash amortization charges from acquisitions  which could harm our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results  including interest earnings and expense  are not materially sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our marketable securities portfolio and interest rates at september   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold
