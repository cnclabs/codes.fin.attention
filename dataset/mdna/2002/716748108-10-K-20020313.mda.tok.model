new accounting standards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended sfas pertaining to the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires an entity to recognize all of its derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if the conditions specified in sfas are met  those instruments may be designated as hedges 
changes in the value of hedge instruments would not impact earnings  except to the extent that the instrument is not perfectly effective as a hedge 
at january   we recognized a liability of  related to costless collars  the cumulative catch up adjustment is recorded as a charge to other comprehensive income 
these collars were designated as cash flow hedges 
we recognized  in oil and gas revenues during the year ended december  as a result of the settlement of costless collars 
we had no open commodity hedging contracts at december  during the fourth quarter  we entered into three million interest rate swaps covering our floating rate debt 
the swaps which are for one  two and three year periods have fixed interest rates of  and  respectively 
the swaps are stated at their fair value and are marked to market through other income in our income statement 
as of december   the fair value of open interest rate swaps was a liability of  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
the company expects to adopt this standard effective january  we have not completed an evaluation of the impact of this new standard 
critical accounting policies full cost method we use the full cost method of accounting  which involves capitalizing all acquisition  exploration and development costs 
once incurred  costs are recorded in the full cost pool or in unevaluated properties 
unevaluated property costs are not subject to depletion 
we review our unevaluated costs on an ongoing basis  and we expect for such costs to be evaluated in one to three years and transferred to the full cost pool at that time 
we calculate depletion using the units of production method 
under this method  the full cost pool and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total amount of proved reserves 
this rate is applied to our total production for the period  and the appropriate expense is recorded 
we capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
we also capitalize the portion of general and administrative costs that are attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
to the extent that total capitalized oil and gas property costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flow from proved oil and natural gas reserves  and the lower of cost and fair value of unproved properties  excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or natural gas prices increase 
we could be required to write down our oil and gas properties if there is a decline in oil and natural gas prices  or downward adjustments are made to our proved reserves 
reserves oil and gas reserve estimates are prepared by our independent petroleum and geological engineers 
proved reserves  and the cash flows related to these reserves  are estimated based on a combination of historical data and estimates of future activity 
reserve estimates are used in calculating depletion and in preparation of the full cost ceiling test 
derivative instruments we follow sfas accounting for derivative instruments 
the accounting standard requires that we record our derivatives at fair market value as of the balance sheet date 
the calculations of fair value are estimates of the derivatives future values based on current factors 
for a more complete discussion of our accounting policies see our notes to consolidated financial statements on page f results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  production oil bbls    gas mcf    total production mcfe    sales total oil sales    total gas sales    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf per mcfe the above sales include income related to gas collars of  and oil collars of  for the year ended december  we were not hedged during and comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the positive results are attributable to the following components production oil production in increased over the year ended december  natural gas production in increased over the year ended december  on a mcfe basis  production for the year ended december  increased over the same period in the increase in production volumes  as compared to  was due to our successful drilling program  which had a success rate completing of wells drilled in prices average oil prices per bbl during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on a mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  as compared to revenues of  the significant growth in production volumes partially offset by reduced commodity prices resulted in significant increases in revenue 
expenses lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during the increase during is primarily due to the increase in production on a mcfe basis 
on a mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased from per mcfe in to in general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to an increase in staffing levels related to the generation of prospects  exploration for oil and gas reserves and operation of properties 
additionally  we have recognized  of non cash compensation expense during as a result of extending the life of two directors options  we recognized  of non cash compensation expense during the fourth quarter 
we also recognized  of non cash compensation expense related to the amortization of unearned deferred compensation 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to  as compared to  in the rise in dd a is primarily due to increased production from bringing new wells on line since the first quarter of on a mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in as compared to is due primarily to the significant capital and future development costs related to our offshore projects 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  increased  during as compared to the increase is the result of an increase in debt levels during resulting from property acquisitions and a higher capital budget  which has been partially funded by borrowings 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to an  benefit being recorded during the increase is the result of fully reversing the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and the net income for the year ended december  was  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period ended the positive results are due to the following components production oil production in increased over the year ended december  natural gas production in increased over the year ended december  on an mcfe basis  production for the year ended december  increased over the same period in the increase in production volumes  as compared to  was primarily due to three new wells that were not producing in cl f and cl f at turtle bayou and valentine sugars came on line during december  may  and august  respectively

oil and gas revenues oil and gas sales increased from  to  in or an increase of 
this increase is the result of both increases in production volumes and higher product prices for both oil and gas 
lease operating expenses lease operating expenses increased from  to  this resulted from the additional wells discussed above as well as high initial costs of three new wells drilled in the fourth quarter of on an mcfe basis  operating expenses for the year decreased from

general and administrative expenses expensed general and administrative costs increased from  in to  in in and   and  of general and administrative costs were capitalized as related directly to the acquisition  exploration and development efforts of our resources 
total general and administrative costs increased in due to an increase of in staffing levels related to the generation of prospects  exploration for oil and gas reserves and operation of properties 
interest expense interest expense increased from in to  in  net of amounts capitalized  as a result of interest incurred on producing properties 
we capitalized interest of  in  as compared to  in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  and private and public offerings of common stock 
net cash flow from operations before working capital changes during the year increased from  in to  in this increase resulted from increased production as the result of successful exploration and development activities 
however  working capital before considering debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  this was caused primarily by capital expenditures related to our active exploration and development program during the proceeds from our recent underwritten public offering and the sale of the valentine field discussed below have eliminated our working capital deficit before considering debt of approximately million at december   and significantly reduced the balance due on our credit facility 
during february and march  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were sold to the public for per share 
after underwriting discounts  we realized proceeds of approximately million 
on march   we closed the sale of our interest in valentine field for million 
the transaction had an effective date of january  at december   our independent reservoir engineering firm attributed bcfe of proved reserves net to our interest in this field 
consistent with the full cost method of accounting  we will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of this sale 
petroquest and our subsidiary petroquest energy  llc the borrower have a million revolving credit facility with hibernia national bank  royal bank of canada and union bank of california  na which permits us to borrow amounts from time to time based on our available borrowing base as determined in the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties  a pledge of the membership interest of the borrower and petroquest s corporate guarantee of the indebtedness of the borrower 
the borrowing base under this credit facility is based upon the valuation on march and september of the borrower s mortgaged properties  projected oil and gas prices  and any other factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
we or the lenders may also request additional borrowing base redeterminations 
on march   the borrowing base under the credit facility was adjusted to million and is subject to quarterly reductions of million commencing on april  outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the prime rate plus per year whenever the borrowing base usage under the credit facility is greater than or equal to or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit for fees of per annum 
at march   we had million of borrowings and a million letter of credit issued pursuant to the credit facility 
the credit facility contains covenants and restrictions common to borrowings of this type  including maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants at march  the credit facility matures on june  as of december   million of the outstanding balance under the credit facility was classified as long term debt reflecting the remaining borrowing base that would be available at december  based upon this determination  the remaining balance outstanding under the credit facility at december  of million was classified as debt subsequently refinanced as a result of the public offering in february and march of we have an exploration and development program budget for the year which will require significant capital 
our budget for direct capital for new projects in is approximately million 
our management believes the cash flows from operations  available borrowing capacity under our credit facility  proceeds from the underwritten public offering and sale of the valentine field will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional bank borrowings  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
there can be no assurances that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company experiences market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company s revenues are derived from the sale of its crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices the company receives for its crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s revenues 
in a typical hedge transaction  the company will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  the company is required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
the company is required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether the company has sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require the company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent the company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
the company had no open commodity hedging contracts as of december  during the fourth quarter  we entered into three interest rate swaps covering million of our floating rate debt 
the swaps which are for one  two and three year periods have fixed interest rates of  and  respectively 
the swaps are stated at their fair value and are marked to market through other income in our income statement 
the company also evaluated the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes may have on the company s credit facility 
debt outstanding under the facility is subject to a floating interest rate and represents approximately of the company s total debt as of december  based upon an analysis utilizing the actual interest rate in effect and balances outstanding as of december  and assuming a increase in interest rates and no changes in the amount of debt outstanding  the potential effect on interest expense for is approximately
