item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events 
our operating results fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
some of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual results are the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  availability of production capacity  changes in the mix of products that our customers purchase  competitive pressures on selling prices  the amount and timing of costs associated with product warranties and returns  the amount and timing of investments in research and development  market acceptance of our products  changes in our product distribution channels and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  the impact of vacation schedules and holidays  largely during the second and third fiscal quarters of our fiscal year  and difficulties in forecasting demand for our products and the planning and managing of inventory levels 
as a result of these factors  many of which are difficult to control or predict  as well as the other risk factors discussed in this annual report on form k  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical  and an industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results 
business conditions in the semiconductor industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand 
the industry is characterized by 
table of contents periods of overcapacity and production shortages  cyclical demand for semiconductors  changes in product mix in response to changes in demand  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  rapid technological change and the introduction of new products  significant price erosion  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
these factors could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
our ability to grow and sustain growth levels may be adversely affected by the recent slowdown in the us economy 
due to the recent decrease in corporate profits  capital spending and consumer confidence  we have experienced weakness in certain of our end markets 
we market our products to several commercial markets  including telecommunications infrastructure  medical electronics and industrial motor drives  which have been affected by the recent slowdown in the us economy 
if the economic slowdown continues  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to acquire additional production capacity to meet the present or future demand for our products 
the semiconductor industry has been characterized by periodic limitations on production capacity 
our current customer demand exceeds our ability to manufacture internally or externally products to meet this demand 
if we are unable to increase our production capacity to meet demand  some of our customers may seek other sources of supply or our future growth may be limited 
we may not be successful in our acquisitions 
we have in the past made  and may in the future make  acquisitions 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including diversion of management s attention during the acquisition process  disruption of ixys ongoing business  the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of an acquired business  failure to successfully integrate the research and development  sales and marketing efforts of an acquired company with our own  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  the challenges inherent in managing an increased number of employees and facilities and the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company  
table of contents the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  and assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire other businesses or product lines or integrate them into our operations without substantial expense  delay in implementation or other operational or financial problems 
ixys could be harmed by litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
although none of our patents or other intellectual property rights has been successfully challenged to date  we have been sued on occasion for purported patent infringement 
for example  we have recently been sued by international rectifier for purportedly infringing some of its patents covering power mosfets 
international rectifier has asked the court to enjoin us from continuing infringement and to award treble damages against us for the infringement of international rectifier s patents 
we have denied infringement of international rectifier s patents and have asserted affirmative defenses to our claims 
the us district court has dismissed our affirmative defenses and granted international rectifier s motion for summary adjudication on the issue of infringement of three international rectifier patents 
trial on the remaining issues is scheduled to commence on july  in addition  the us district court has issued a permanent injunction against ixys  effectively barring us from selling or distributing the allegedly infringing products 
ixys has appealed the injunction  and the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit has stayed the injunction pending further review 
we intend to appeal the us district court s rulings  and to contest international rectifier s claims vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain 
see ixys business legal proceedings provided elsewhere in this item to the annual report on form k 
additionally  in the future  we could be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other third parties 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
no assurance can be provided that any future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or that assertions of infringement  if proven to be true  will not harm our business 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation  including the pending litigation with international rectifier  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us 
an adverse decision in the international rectifier litigation or any other infringement could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
we depend on external foundries to manufacture many of our products 
forty four percent of our revenues in fiscal year came from wafers manufactured for us by external foundries 
our dependence on external foundries may grow 
we have arrangements with four wafer foundries  two of which produce substantially all of the wafers that we purchase from external foundries 
samsung electronics facility in kiheung  south korea is our principal external foundry 
our relationships with our external foundries do not guarantee prices  delivery or lead times  or wafer or product quantities sufficient to satisfy current or expected demand 
these foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis 
we provide these foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
at any given time  these foundries could choose to prioritize capacity for their own use or other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that these foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with these or other foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity 
table of contents as required  our relationships with our customers could be harmed and our revenues would likely be reduced 
moreover  even if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties could be expensive and could harm our operating results 
other risks associated with our reliance on external foundries include the lack of control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the external foundries that manufacture our wafers and products 
we cannot be certain these external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our wafers and products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
these circumstances could harm our ability to deliver our products on time or increase our costs 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture our products efficiently 
we manufacture our products in facilities that are owned and operated by us  as well as in external wafer foundries and independent subcontract assembly facilities 
the fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process  and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous die on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of  among other factors minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failure  or wafer breakage 
for these and other reasons  we could experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
additionally  as we increase our manufacturing output  we may also experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
as a result  we may not be able to cost effectively expand our production capacity in a timely manner 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology 
more specifically  we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can we assure you that  if challenged  our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design their products around any patents that may be issued to us 

table of contents our international operations expose us to material risks 
during fiscal year  our product sales by region were approximately in north america  approximately in europe and the middle east and approximately in asia 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
ixys maintains significant operations in germany and the united kingdom and contracts with suppliers and manufacturers in south korea  japan and elsewhere in europe and asia 
some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally are foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the laws  regulations or policies of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  and economic or political instability 
our sales of products manufactured in our lampertheim  germany facility and our costs at that facility are denominated in euros  and sales of products manufactured in our chippenham  uk facility and our costs at that facility are primarily denominated in british pounds and euros 
fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar could have a significant impact on our balance sheet and results of operations  including our net income 
we currently do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
if we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in other foreign currencies  we could be exposed to even greater risks of currency fluctuations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do us laws regarding the manufacture and sale of our products in the us therefore  the risk of piracy of our technology and products may be greater when we manufacture or sell our products in these foreign countries 
our revenues are dependent upon our products being designed into our customers products 
some of our new products are incorporated into customers products or systems at the design stage 
the value of any design win largely depends upon the commercial success of the customer s product and on the extent to which the design of the customer s electronic system also accommodates incorporation of components manufactured by our competitors 
in addition  our customers could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require our products 
we may not achieve design wins or our design wins may not result in future revenues 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
the time from initiation of design to volume production of new power semiconductor products often takes months or longer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take nine months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which may last an additional nine months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 

table of contents our backlog may not result in future revenues 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
as a result  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenues  could harm our results of operations 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive 
certain of our target markets are intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in our target markets depends on the following factors product quality  reliability and performance  product features  timely delivery of products  price  breadth of product line  design and introduction of new products  and technical support and service 
in addition  our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace  or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to  our products 
the introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
our primary competitors include advanced power technology  fuji  international rectifier  infineon  on semiconductor  semikron international  powerex  stmicroelectronics  siemens and toshiba 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we have 
some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be profitable for us to sell our products or benefit from established customer relationships that provide them with a competitive advantage 
we rely on our distributors and sales representatives to sell many of our products 
a substantial majority of our products are sold through distributors and sales representatives 
our distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect 
in addition  we depend upon the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
these distributors and sales representatives  in turn  depend substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we believe that our success will continue to depend upon these distributors and sales representatives 
at march   no distributor accounted for greater than of our outstanding receivables 
if this or any other distributor or sales representative experiences financial difficulties  or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business could be harmed 

table of contents our future success depends on the continued service of management and key engineering personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
there is intense competition for qualified employees in the semiconductor industry  particularly for highly skilled design  applications and test engineers 
competition is especially intense in the silicon valley  where our us design facility is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could leave us at any time in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources  and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management employees 
if we lose the services of or fail to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel  our business could be harmed 
periods of rapid growth and expansion could continue to place a significant strain on our resources  including our employee base 
to manage our possible future growth effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
in doing so  we will periodically implement new software and other systems that will affect our internal operations regionally or globally 
presently  we are upgrading our enterprise resource planning software to integrate our operations worldwide 
the conversion process is complex and requires  among other things  that data from our existing system be made compatible with the upgraded system 
during the transition to this upgrade  we could experience delays in ordering materials  inventory tracking problems and other inefficiencies  which could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers 
future growth will also require us to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
in addition  our continued growth and the evolution of our business plan will require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we may not be able to effectively manage the growth and evolution of our current business 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholders matters provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the future market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly due to variations in our actual or expected quarterly operating results  announcements or introductions of new products  technological innovations by our competitors or development setbacks by us  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation  changes in analysts estimates of our performance or changes in analysts forecasts regarding our industry  competitors or customers  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions or a failure to achieve the expected benefits of an acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or analysts  or general economic and market conditions 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry  and could harm the market price of our common stock 
our dependence on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products subject us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs 
we depend on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
during fiscal year  the majority of our products were assembled by independent subcontractors 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
in addition  we use a limited number of subcontractors to assemble a significant portion of our products 
if one or more of these subcontractors experiences financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties  we could experience a reduction or interruption in supply 
although we believe alternative subcontractors are available  our operating results could temporarily suffer until our engages one or more of those alternative subcontractors 
our markets are subject to technological change and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by changing technologies  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
failure to do so could cause us to lose our competitive position and seriously impact our future revenues 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 

table of contents our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and  therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our revenue projections 
we also typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our external suppliers and foundries  we may order materials or production in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
power semiconductors with operating voltages above volts are subject to regulations intended to address the safety  reliability and quality of the products 
these regulations relate to processes  design  materials and assembly 
for example  in the united states some high voltage products are required to pass underwriters laboratory recognition for voltage isolation and fire hazard tests 
sales of power semiconductors outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer than that required for us approval  and the requirements may differ 
in addition  approximately of our revenues in fiscal year were derived from the sale of products included in medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and internationally  including the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements for medical device manufacturers to meet  including adherence to good manufacturing practices  or gmp  regulations and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could prevent our products from being included in approved medical devices 
our business could also be harmed by delays in receiving or the failure to receive required approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
business interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake and other natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan and does not have backup generators 
our corporate headquarters in california is located near major earthquake fault lines and has experienced earthquakes in the past 
california also has recently been subject to shortages of electrical power and is subject to power outages 
if power outages occur  our ability to conduct administrative matters and test our products could be seriously impaired  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all our losses 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located in california and are subject to the same earthquake and power outage risks 
a fire  major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our facilities or those of our major suppliers could disrupt our operations and those of our suppliers  which could in turn limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
we may be affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to a variety of laws  rules and regulations in the united states and in germany related to the use  storage  handling  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 

table of contents any of those regulations could require us to acquire expensive equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with them 
if we incur substantial additional expenses  product costs could significantly increase 
our failure to comply with present or future environmental laws  rules and regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
we face the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of devices that incorporate our products resulted in adverse effects 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year were derived from sales of products used in medical devices such as defibrillators 
product liability risks may exist even for those medical devices that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we do not currently carry product liability insurance  and any defects in our products used in these devices could result in significant recall or product liability costs to us 
abb ag and nathan zommer  phd own a controlling interest in our common stock 
abb ag and nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  collectively beneficially own  as of june   and assuming the issuance of the approximately million shares of ixys common stock to be issued in connection with our acquisition of clare  inc  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  abb ag and dr 
zommer  acting together  could exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors 
these concentrated holdings could result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible changes in control of ixys  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the anti takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control because the terms of any issued preferred stock could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction  without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
our stockholders must give substantial advance notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it more difficult for us to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 

table of contents item properties ixys administrative  marketing  development and manufacturing facilities are located in santa clara  california  lampertheim  germany and chippenham  england 
the santa clara facility consists of approximately  square feet under a lease that expires january  we have an option to extend the lease for five years 
the base rent under this lease is approximately  per year 
the lampertheim facility  which we own  consists of approximately  square feet 
the chippenham facility consists of approximately  square feet under a lease that expires december  the base rent under this lease is approximately  per year 
we believe that our current facilities will be adequate through at least fiscal year and that suitable additional space will be available in the future as needed on commercially reasonably terms 

table of contents item legal proceedings on june   international rectifier corporation filed an action for patent infringement against us in the united states district court for the central district of california  alleging that certain of our products sold in the united states infringe us patents owned by international rectifier 
international rectifier s complaint against us contend that our alleged infringement of international rectifier s patents has been and continues to be willful and deliberate 
the complaint seeks to enjoin us from further infringement and requests an award of actual monetary damages on sales of products that are claimed to infringe international rectifier s patents 
international rectifier also seeks to have the damages trebled 
we answered the complaint  denying any infringement and asserting that the international rectifier patents are invalid and unenforceable for  among other reasons  failure of international rectifier to properly disclose known prior art during its prosecution of the patents in suit 
we also contended that international rectifier s claims are barred by reason of the doctrines of estoppel and laches 
trial in this case had been originally scheduled for june   however  the us district court has repeatedly continued the trial date  which is currently set for july  the us district court has also granted motions for summary adjudication dismissing all of our affirmative defenses and decided that certain of our power mosfets and igbts infringe certain claims of each of international rectifier s us patents   and or  furthermore  on may   the us district court entered a permanent injunction  which became effective june   barring us from making  using  offering to sell or selling in  or importing into  the united states  mosfets including igbts covered by the subject patents 
on motion by us  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed the injunction  pending further review 
international rectifier also contends that our importation into the united states of certain ixys designed mosfet products manufactured for us by samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung is in violation of a consent decree and injunction entered against samsung in another lawsuit to which we were not a party the samsung injunction 
in february  international rectifier served samsung and us with a post judgment ex parte application for order to show cause re contempt seeking  among other things  an enforcement of the samsung injunction enjoining our importation into the united states of the allegedly infringing products  and an appropriate fine 
we responded by filing a motion requesting clarification of the samsung injunction  or if the samsung injunction is construed to cover our products  modification of the samsung injunction to exclude ixys devices 
argument concerning the order to show cause was held in may  at which time the us district court remarked that we were bound by the samsung injunction  and that we and samsung were attempting to subvert the samsung injunction by having us take delivery outside the united states of the allegedly infringing products 
at that time  the us district court deferred a decision as to whether we and samsung were in contempt 
in march  no decision having been reached on its earlier motion  we renewed and amended our motion to clarify  modify or vacate the samsung injunction as to ixys devices 
on march   the us district court adopted and entered interim findings of fact and conclusions of law that decided  among other things  that we were bound by  and ixys devices are not excepted from  the samsung injunction 
on april   the us district court denied our renewed motion to clarify  modify or vacate the samsung injunction 
we immediately appealed each of these rulings to the court of appeals for the federal circuit and requested a stay of the samsung injunction as to ixys devices pending outcome of these appeals 
the court of appeals for the federal circuit granted the motion to stay the samsung injunction pending further review  and on june   entered a ruling on the merits of the request for stay of injunction  granting our motion to stay pending appeal 
it remains our intent to continue to contest the claims of international rectifier vigorously 
furthermore  we expect to appeal any ruling of contempt 
while we believe our defenses to the various claims and our arguments on appeal are meritorious  there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome 
in the event of an adverse outcome  damages or injunctions awarded by the us district court could be materially adverse to our financial condition and results of operations 
in response to international rectifier s claims  samsung contends that we are contractually obligated under the terms of our wafer supply agreement with samsung to defend it against the contempt claims made by international rectifier and indemnify and hold samsung harmless in connection with such claims 
we are 
table of contents considering samsung s request in light of the terms of the wafer supply agreement between us and samsung 
while we believe that neither ixys nor samsung is or could be in violation of the injunction for various reasons we believe to be meritorious  including an express reservation as to our designed parts in the consent decree  there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome 
in the event of an adverse ruling against us on the ultimate issue of contempt  or if we are obligated to defend and indemnify samsung  any damages awarded or injunction entered by the us district court could be materially adverse to our financial condition and results of operations 
in november  we filed a lawsuit for patent infringement against international rectifier gmbh in the county court of mannheim  germany 
the lawsuit charged international rectifier with infringing at least two of our german patents 
these patents cover key design features of our proprietary integrated power module technology  which the lawsuit alleged international rectifier had been infringing in products sold in germany 
the lawsuit sought damages and an injunction prohibiting the continued infringement by international rectifier 
on march   a public hearing took place in mannheim  germany  and international rectifier did not deny making use of the above patents 
on april   the county court of mannheim rendered a judgment in our favor that enjoined international rectifier from marketing  utilizing  importing or possessing two of our german patents  and imposed a fine of up to eur  to the state or imprisonment of international rectifier s managing director for each violation of the injunction 
in addition  international rectifier was ordered to disclose to us information about its previous sales activity  offers of sales  advertisements  production costs and profits concerning the infringed patents 
international rectifier was also ordered to pay attorney fees and past and future damages and unjustified enrichment resulting from international rectifier s infringing practices  as calculated by the information to be provided to us by international rectifier 
international rectifier appealed the judgment to the court of appeals in karlsruhe 
subsequent to a hearing on this appeal in march  the court of appeals in karlsruhe ruled in our favor and the judgment entered by the county court of mannheim is now final 
notwithstanding this appeal  ixys had begun enforcing the judgment of the county court of mannheim  in order to do so ixys was required to pay eur  as a form of bond to be held by the county court of mannheim 
in lieu of the bond  the court accepted a bank guarantee 
although international rectifier has a right to appeal the ruling of the appeals court in karlsruhe  the bond may be returned to ixys and ixys may continue to enforce the judgment of the county court of mannheim 
international rectifier has also begun to disclose information to ixys pursuant to the judgment for purposes of calculating our damages award 
on february   we filed a lawsuit against international rectifier italia spa in the civil court of monza  italy  for patent infringement of at least two of our european patents  which correspond to the german patents involved in the above described legal proceeding in germany 
the lawsuit seeks the seizure of semiconductor modules produced by international rectifier that infringe on our patents and an injunction against further production of such modules by international rectifier in italy 
at a hearing on march   the judge rejected international rectifier s arguments that the monza tribunal was not competent to hear the case and nominated an expert to comment on the technical details of the alleged patent infringement 
following the scheduled submission of technical writs by the parties in may  the expert submitted written comments in june on june   the civil court of monza rendered a preliminary injunction in our favor with respect to certain claims of infringement by international rectifier spa under the terms of this preliminary injunction  we are permitted to seize  and international rectifier spa is prohibited from distributing  certain of the allegedly infringing semiconductor modules 
the injunction is an interlocutory measure that remains in effect until there has been a judgment on the merits 
hearings on the merits of the law suit were held on december   january and february  it could be as long as several years before a judgment on the merits is rendered 
while we believe our claims against international rectifier in the civil court of monza  italy are meritorious  there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome 
we do not believe that an adverse ruling by the civil court of monza would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations  financial performance or liquidity

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading company in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of high power  high performance power semiconductors 
our power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power required by electronic products 
we focus on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than watts of power 
we were founded in in  we acquired from abb our semiconductor operation in lampertheim  germany  now called ixys semiconductor gmbh 
this acquisition provided us with a strong foothold in europe 
in  we reincorporated in delaware 
also in  abb converted approximately million in debt owed to it by us into our capital stock 
in january  we purchased the lampertheim facility  which had previously been leased from abb 
in september  ixys corporation merged with paradigm technology  a delaware corporation that designed and marketed sram products  in a transaction accounted for as a reverse merger 
in the merger  paradigm issued its common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of our capital stock 
at the conclusion of the merger  ixys stockholders held approximately of the combined company  and the historic accounting records of ixys became those of the combined company 
accordingly  paradigm formally changed its name to ixys corporation 
in may  we acquired directed energy  which gave us added scientific expertise and additional products related to laser diode drives  high voltage pulse generators and modulators 
in connection with this acquisition  we issued  shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of directed energy 
on june   we completed the acquisition of clare  inc  a provider of high voltage analog and mixed signal semiconductor integrated packages and discrete components for use in electronic communications  computer  and industrial equipment 
in connection with this acquisition  we issued approximately million shares of ixys common stock to the holders of outstanding shares of clare common stock and assumed options to purchase approximately million shares of ixys common stock 
the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
the semiconductor industry has historically experienced a decrease in average selling prices of products over time 
from through  the semiconductor industry experienced worldwide overcapacity  which caused prices to erode and was accompanied by a slowdown in the demand for semiconductors 
additionally  a number of factors can result in quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results  including the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  and availability of production capacity 
in fiscal year  north american sales represented approximately  and international sales represented approximately  of our net revenues 
of our international sales  approximately were derived from sales in europe and the middle east and approximately were derived from sales in asia 
no single end customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal year we do not hedge our foreign currency transactions 
accordingly  although many of our sales and expenses occur in the same currency  translation of foreign currencies into us dollars may negatively impact us 
we relied on external foundries for approximately of our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal year  and our utilization of external foundries is expected to grow 
we have arrangements with four external wafer foundries  two of which produce substantially all of the wafers provided to us by external foundries 
our principal external foundry is samsung electronics facility located in kiheung  south korea 
our relationship with samsung electronics extends over years 
we provide our foundries forecasts for wafer fabrication six months in advance and make firm purchase commitments one to two months in advance of delivery 
other than these firm commitments  we do not have any obligations to order any minimum quantities 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for ixys include inventories  valuation of plant  equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition and other independent subcontractors  accounting for legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast and demand requirements for the next twelve to eighteen months 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
valuation of plant  equipment  and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our plant and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of when certain events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable 
this standard requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill in the event the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of the useful lives of assets and future cash flows from such assets 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment provided that we have received a customer executed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns and allowance for so called ship and debit transactions related to current period product revenue 
our management analyzes historical returns discounts and ship and debit transactions  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate  based on historical experience  of the amounts necessary to repair or replace our product during the warrant period  which is generally one year 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to repair or replace our product could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
legal contingencies 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as pensions or capital leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in differed tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease from net revenues of million in fiscal year international net revenues were million for fiscal year  or of net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal year  or of net revenues 
the decrease in net revenues for fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily related to an approximately decrease in units shipped in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and an approximately decrease in average selling prices across our product lines 
we believe that the decrease in unit sales volume was largely attributable to decreased demand for power conversion systems for communications infrastructure applications 
net revenues for fiscal year were million  a increase from net revenues of million in fiscal year international net revenues were million for fiscal year  or of net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal year  or of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues for fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily related to an approximately increase in units shipped in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  offset by approximately decrease in average selling prices across our product line 
we believe that the increase in unit sales volume was largely attributable to increased demand for power conversion systems for communications infrastructure applications 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the decrease in margins was primarily due to a decrease in average selling price as well as a change in the mix of product sold 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the increase in margins was primarily due to increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
research  development and engineering 
during fiscal year  research  development and engineering r d expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the dollar decrease was due to a fewer number of research and development projects 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expense increased as a result of such expenses decreasing at a relatively slower rate than revenues 
during fiscal year  research  development and engineering r d expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the dollar increase was due to higher engineering headcount in fiscal year  as well as an increase in the number of r d projects

as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million from cash and cash equivalents of million at march   which was an increase of million from cash and cash equivalents of million at march  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal years to was related to the acquisition of additional manufacturing equipment and cash used in the acquisition of westcode 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal years to was primarily due to the million in net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock in connection with an underwritten follow on public offering in october cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million  which represents an increase of  from million in fiscal year the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the liquidation of receivables  in the normal course of business  offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million 
we invested million for plant and equipment purchases to increase capacity in order to meet increased demand 
in addition  we invested million in the acquisition of westcode semiconductors limited 
cash flows from financing activities 
during fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was mainly due to proceeds from capital lease obligations 
there are three lines of credit facilities available to us 
we have one line of credit with a us bank that consists of a million commitment amount which is available through september the line bears interest at the bank s prime rate at march  
the line is collateralized by certain assets and contains certain general and financial covenants 
at march   we had drawn  against such line of credit 

table of contents we have another line of credit with a us bank that consists of a  commitment  which is available through september the line bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the line is collateralized by a  certificate of deposit that we have with the bank 
at march   there were no amounts being drawn against such line of credit 
in germany  at march   we had a million line of credit with a german bank with no outstanding balance 
this line supports a letter of credit facility 
in july  a german bank issued to us a commitment letter for a eur million equipment lease facility 
our existing equipment leases  eur million at march   were charged against the facility 
the equipment leases provide financing at varying pricing for periods up to months 
in addition to the rights to the equipment  the bank holds a security interest in other assets and up to  deposited with the bank 
in july  in the same commitment letter discussed above  the bank also committed to issue a credit line to us up to eur million for a wafer fabrication facility in germany  including leasehold improvements  clean room construction and fabrication  computer and office equipment 
at march   we had drawn  under this commitment 
the security interest of the bank under the equipment lease facility also collateralizes this line 
in december  ixys entered into a term loan with a swiss bank in the amount of sfr  the loan bears interest of and is due in november our accounts receivable at march  were million  a decrease of as compared to million at march  our inventories at march  were million  an increase of as compared to million at march  net plant and equipment at march  were million  an increase of as compared to million at march  as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements  including potential investments in other companies and other assets to support the strategic growth of our business  over the next twelve months 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses  products and technologies and we expect to use our cash to fund these types of activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the recent decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited

table of contents new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
our adoption date for sfas no 
was april  as of that date  amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  including those recorded in past business combinations  ceased 
as a result of the elimination of this amortization  other expense will decrease by approximately  annually for goodwill currently recognized 
as required by sfas no 
 we will perform impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of the adoption date 
we will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
in connection with the sfas no 
transitional goodwill impairment test  we will utilize the required two step method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption date 
to accomplish this  we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the adoption date 
we will then have up to six months from the adoption date to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we will then perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
if necessary  in the second step  we will compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the adoption date 
the implied fair value of goodwill will be determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation will be the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we will record a transitional impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit over the implied fair value 
sfas no 
requires that this second step be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in connection with the sfas no 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test  we will utilize the required one step method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the adoption date 
the test will consist of a comparison of the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets with the carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
we have not yet determined the impact of the provisions of the impairment test under sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position  however  the possibility exists that we will incur a significant transitional impairment loss 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our income statement during the quarter ending september  in october  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for the disposition of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 however  sfas no 
retains the requirement of apb opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that has either been disposed of by sale  abandonment or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates as our line of credit in the us has a variable interest rate 
an increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
for example  under the current drawing on the line of credit  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by  foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year international sales are made mostly from our german subsidiary and are typically denominated in the euro 
our german subsidiary also incurs most of its expenses in the local currency 
our foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
