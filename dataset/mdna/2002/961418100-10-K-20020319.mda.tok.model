item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of westport s financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we follow the sales method of accounting for oil and natural gas revenues 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and natural gas sold to purchasers 
successful efforts accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  successful exploratory wells and all development wells are capitalized 
items charged to expense generally include geological and geophysical costs  costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and oil and natural gas production costs 
all of our oil and natural gas properties are located within the continental united states  the gulf of mexico and canada 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  or gaap  and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
our stockholders should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
we review our long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon management s outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field by field basis  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize price swaps  futures contracts or collars  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
while such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  management believes these contracts can be utilized as an effective component of cprm activities 
overview westport is an independent energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploitation  acquisition and exploration activities primarily in the united states 
our reserves and production operations are concentrated in the following diversified divisions northern rocky mountains  southern permian basin  mid continent and gulf coast  and gulf of mexico offshore 
we focus on maintaining a balanced portfolio of lower risk  long life onshore reserves and higher margin offshore reserves to provide a diversified cash flow foundation for our exploitation  acquisition and exploration activities 
our results of operations are significantly impacted by the prices of oil and natural gas  which are volatile 
in  oil and natural gas prices decreased compared to prices in oil and natural gas prices declined from per mcf and per bbl at the beginning of to per mcf and per bbl at december  the prices we receive for our oil vary from nymex prices based on the location and quality of the crude oil 
the prices we receive for our natural gas are based on henry hub prices reduced by transportation and processing fees 
oil and natural gas production costs are composed of lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense consists of pumpers salaries  utilities  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
in general  lease operating expense per unit of production is lower on our offshore properties and does not fluctuate proportionately with our production 
production taxes are assessed by applicable taxing authorities as a percentage of revenues 
however  properties located in federal waters offshore are generally not subject to production taxes 
transportation costs are comprised of costs paid to a carrier to deliver oil or natural gas to a specified delivery point 
in some cases we receive a payment from the purchases of our oil and natural gas which is net of gas transportation costs and in other instances we pay the costs of transportation 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and the cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
delay rentals are typically fixed in nature in the short term 
however  other exploration costs are generally discretionary and exploration activity levels are determined by a number of factors  including oil and natural gas prices  availability of funds  quantity and character of investment projects  availability of service providers and competition 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and natural gas properties is computed using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
for purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined twice each year 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for production  fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices impact the level of proved reserves 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion 
we assess our proved properties on a field by field basis for impairment  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not be recoverable 
when making such assessments  we compare the expected undiscounted future net revenues on a field by field basis with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues based on escalated prices 
impairments for the years ended december   and  were calculated based on the following prices oil prices per barrel of  and  respectively  and natural gas prices per mcf of  and  respectively 
oil and natural gas prices were both escalated annually at in and natural gas prices for were increased from per mcf in to per mcf in and then escalated at thereafter 
estimates of declining production were based on internal estimates of which of the net present value was audited by independent reserve engineers and estimated operating costs and severance taxes were based on past experience 
operating and future development costs were escalated annually at in  and reserve categories used in the impairment analysis for all periods considered are categories of proven reserves and probable and possible reserves  which were risk adjusted based on our drilling plans and history of successfully developing those types of reserves 
we periodically assess our unproved properties to determine if any such properties have been impaired 
such assessment is based on  among other things  the fair value of properties located in the same area as the unproved property and our intent to pursue additional exploration opportunities on such property 
stock compensation expense consists of noncash charges resulting from the application of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
to certain stock options granted to employees  issuance of restricted stock to certain employees and a one time expense related to the repurchase of employee stock options in march general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our denver  dallas and houston offices 
while we expect such costs to increase with our growth  we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
mergers on august   the stockholders of belco approved the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of june   between belco and westport 
pursuant to the merger agreement  old westport was merged with and into belco  with belco surviving and changing its name to westport resources corporation 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction for financial accounting purposes 
because former old westport stockholders now own a majority of the outstanding westport common stock as a result of the merger  the merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which old westport is the purchaser of belco 
old westport was formed by the merger on april  of westport oil and gas with epgc 
as a result of the merger  westport oil and gas became a wholly owned subsidiary of epgc  which subsequently changed its name to westport resources corporation  and the stockholders of westport oil and gas became the majority stockholders of epgc 
the senior management team of westport oil and gas became the management team for the combined company  complemented by certain key managers from epgc 
results of operations as indicated above  the merger between belco and old westport was accounted for using purchase accounting with old westport as the surviving accounting entity 
we began consolidating the results of belco with the results of old westport as of the august  closing date 
the merger between epgc and westport oil and gas was accounted for using purchase accounting with westport oil and gas as the surviving accounting entity 
old westport began consolidating the results of epgc with the results of westport oil and gas as of the april  closing date 
the discussion below includes a comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues 
oil and natural gas revenues for increased by million  or  from million in to million in production from the acquired belco properties accounted for million of the increase 
revenue increased million from recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico 
the increases were partially offset by decreases of and in realized oil and natural gas prices  respectively 
production volumes increased bcfe from bcfe in to bcfe in acquired belco and epgc properties accounted for bcfe and bcfe of the increase  respectively 
production volumes also increased bcfe from recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico  bcfe from coalbed methane development in the powder river basin area  bcfe from the horizontal drilling program in the wiley field  and bcfe from the acquired interest in the ward estes field in august increases were partially offset by declines in existing properties 
hedging transactions had the effect of increasing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe  and reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe 
oil and natural gas revenues for increased by million  or  from million in to million in production from the acquired epgc properties accounted for million of the increase and the remaining increase resulted from increases of and in realized oil and natural gas prices  respectively 
the increase of  mmcfe in production volumes from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in was primarily due to  mmcfe from the acquired epgc properties 
hedging transactions had the effect of reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million and million  or and per mcfe  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
commodity price risk management activities  or cprm  activities 
for  we recorded a net gain of million in the non hedge change in fair value of derivatives compared to a net loss of million for a net gain of million was recorded in for non hedge settlements of derivatives 
the net gains in and the net loss in relate to settlements of derivatives and changes in fair value on derivatives that under sfas no 
do not qualify for hedge accounting 
westport oil and gas did not have any derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting for gain loss on sale of operating assets 
for  we recorded a loss on sale of operating assets of million compared to gains of million in and million in primarily from the sale of offshore properties 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense for increased by million  or  from million in to million in lease operating expenses from the acquired epgc properties and belco properties accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico  an increased level of workovers in several of our properties and a general increase in the cost of oil field services and materials accounted for the remainder 
on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expense remained relatively constant at in and in lease operating expense for increased by million  or  from million in to million in lease operating expenses from the acquired epgc properties accounted for million of the increase 
on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expense decreased from to  primarily due to the lower lease operating expense associated with the acquired epgc properties 
production taxes 
production taxes for increased by million  or  from million in to million  in acquired belco properties accounted for million of the increase in production taxes 
the increase from the acquired belco properties is partially offset by a decrease in revenue from onshore properties as a result of a decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices 
as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production taxes remained relatively constant at in and in production taxes for increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in production taxes is primarily attributable to an increase in the average realized price of oil and natural gas 
as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production taxes decreased from to 
the decrease in production taxes as a percent of revenue is primarily the result of the epgc merger  which increased the number of offshore properties that are not subject to production taxes 
transportation costs 
transportation costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to additional offshore and coalbed methane wells that started producing in the latter part of and early  which incur higher costs to transport the natural gas 
transportation costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in transportation costs from the acquired epgc properties accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase was due to additional offshore natural gas wells and coalbed methane wells that started producing in exploration costs 
exploration costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in dry hole costs increased million as a result of six unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled in the gulf of mexico during for there were five unsuccessful exploratory offshore wells and three unsuccessful exploratory onshore wells 
purchases of gulf of mexico seismic data increased million during compared to exploration costs increased million from the acquired belco properties 
exploration costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in exploration costs consisted of million of dry hole costs  million of geological and geophysical costs and million of delay rentals 
the increase was primarily due to million in additional dry hole costs as a result of five unsuccessful offshore exploratory wells and three unsuccessful onshore exploratory wells drilled during geological and geophysical costs increased million due to increased offshore activity in delay rentals accounted for million of the increase as a result of acquiring offshore leases in the epgc merger 
depletion  depreciation and amortization  or dd a  expense 
dd a expense increased million in  from million in to million in depletion related to the acquired epgc properties and belco properties caused dd a expense to increase million and million  respectively 
recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico caused dd a expense to increase million 
an increase of million was primarily due to additions in oil and natural gas properties in northern louisiana in the remaining increase was primarily due to the additions of oil and natural gas properties during these increases were the primary factors that caused dd a expense to increase on a per mcfe basis from in to in dd a expense increased million during from million in to million in depletion related to the acquired epgc properties caused dd a expense to increase million 
the remaining increase was due to the additions in oil and natural gas properties during the average dd a rate increased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during  a increase in the dd a rates primarily due to the acquired offshore epgc properties 
impairment of proved properties 
during  and  we recognized proved property impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
impairments recorded in were as follows million based on the results of unsuccessful development drilling in the rocky mountains  million resulting from depressed oil and natural gas prices in the rocky mountains and mid continent  million based on the results of unsuccessful development drilling in the gulf of mexico and million resulting from depressed natural gas prices in the gulf of mexico 
impairments recorded in were mainly the result of a decline in oil and natural gas reserve value due to reserve volume reductions in underperforming fields in wyoming  offshore and louisiana 
the impairment recorded in was the result of a decrease in risk adjusted probable reserves for the ward estes lease located in west texas  which were subsequently assigned to the operator of the lease in exchange for existing producing property equipment and infrastructure owned by the operator 
impairment of unproved properties 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million on offshore leases  as a result of an assessment of the exploration opportunities existing on such properties 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million  as a result of an assessment of the exploration opportunities existing on such properties 
the million consisted of million for leases held in north dakota  million for leases held offshore and million for various leases held in kansas  wyoming and louisiana 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million of which million was associated with a prospect off the coast of argentina and the remaining million was for various leases held in north dakota and wyoming 
stock compensation expense 
in  we recorded million in stock compensation expense consisting of million as a result of applying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
and million in expense related to the issuance of restricted stock 
in  we recognized million of stock compensation expense due to a million one time stock compensation expense related to the repurchase of employee stock options and million related to provisions of fasb interpretation no 
there was no stock compensation expense recorded in general and administrative  or g a  expense 
g a expense increased million in  or  from million in to million in in connection with the epgc merger additional employees were hired in the houston office which accounted for a million increase in g a expense 
the merger accounted for million of the increase 
a majority of the remaining increase was due to payroll costs resulting from an increase in staff in reflecting expanded size and scope of our operations as a result of our reporting obligations under the exchange act 
on an mcfe basis  g a expense in was compared to in g a expense increased million  or  during  from million in to million in in connection with the epgc merger additional employees were hired in the houston office  which accounted for a million increase in g a expense 
offsetting the increase in g a expense was a million increase in overhead recoveries from additional drilling in and million additional costs incurred in related to closing an office acquired in an acquisition 
on an mcfe basis  g a expense decreased from during to during other income expense 
other expense for was million compared to million for interest expense increased million in  as a result of the increase in the debt balance relating to the merger 
other income increased million as compared to primarily due to an increase in interest income of million and changes in fair values of million on interest rate swap contracts that were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
other income expense for was million compared to million for the variance was primarily due to interest expense which increased million from million in to million in as a result of million in additional borrowings relating to the epgc merger 
the increase in interest expense was offset by an increase in interest income and other of million primarily due to an increase in average cash balance during income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million million deferred and million current for and million million deferred and million current for the difference between the income tax expense for those periods and the amounts that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes is due primarily to the utilization of credits generated from applying enhanced recovery methods in both periods 
we recorded income tax expense of million for and no income tax expense or benefit for resulting from a loss incurred in the difference between the income tax expense benefit for those periods and the amounts that would be calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to income before income taxes is due primarily to the credits from applying enhanced recovery methods in and a deferred tax valuation allowance recorded in net income 
net income for was million compared to net income of million for the variance was primarily attributable to increases in revenues of million and decrease in other expense of million offset by increases of million in operating expenses and million in income tax expense 
on a per share basis net income declined to per basic share  fully diluted from per basic share  fully diluted due to an increase of million shares outstanding 
net income for was million compared to a net loss of million for the variance was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues of million  partially offset by increases of million in operating expenses and million in income tax expense 
on a per share basis net loss was per basic and diluted share in  compared to net income of per basic share and per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital have been for the exploitation  acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 
cash flow from operating activities was million for compared to million for operating cash flow in increased compared to due to a increase in production as a result of the mergers with epgc and belco  recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico  and additional production from coalbed methane development from the wiley and ward estes fields 
cash flow from operating activities increased million from million for to million for due to a increase in commodity prices and as a result of the merger with epgc 
cash flow used in investing activities was million for compared to million for investing activities for include million used for exploitation and exploration activities and million used for acquisitions  offset by proceeds from sales of properties of million 
investing activities for included million for exploitation and exploration activities and million for acquisitions million related to the merger with epgc  offset by proceeds from sales of properties of million 
cash flow used in investing activities was million for compared to cash flow generated in of million 
cash generated in was due in part to million of proceeds from sales of oil and natural gas properties  offset by million in additions to oil and natural gas properties 
net cash generated in financing activities was million for compared to million cash used in financing activities for consisted of million in repayment of long term debt  new financing fees of million  stock repurchase of million and preferred stock dividend of million offset by million in borrowings and million from the issuance of common stock 
financing activities for reflected borrowings of million utilized to consummate the merger with epgc and million from the issuance of common stock offset by repayments of long term debt of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash used in of million 
cash was used in for repayments of long term debt of million offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock 
financing activity the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    non cancelable operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    revolving credit facility we entered into a new credit facility  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  with a syndicate of banks upon closing of the merger 
the revolving credit facility  as amended on november   provides for a maximum committed amount of million and a borrowing base of approximately million as of december  the facility matures on july  advances under the revolving credit facility are in the form of either a base rate loan or a eurodollar loan 
the interest on a base rate loan is a fluctuating rate based upon the highest of the rate of interest announced by jp morgan chase bank  formerly known as the chase manhattan bank  as its prime rate  the secondary market rate for three month certificates of deposits plus  and the federal funds effective rate plus  in each case plus a margin of to based upon the ratio of total debt to ebitdax 
the interest on a eurodollar loan is a fluctuating rate based upon the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted plus a margin of to based upon the ratio of total debt to ebitdax 
as of december   we had borrowings of million with an average interest rate of and letters of credit issued of approximately million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and available unused borrowing capacity of approximately million 
redemption of senior subordinated notes due on september   we redeemed all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due at a price of  per note plus accrued interest 
the notes were originally issued by coda energy and assumed in connection with the merger  and they were redeemed pursuant to the optional redemption provision of the related indenture at of the principal amount of each note plus accrued interest  for a total amount of approximately million  consisting of million in principal and million in accrued interest 
the redemption was funded by borrowings under the revolving credit facility and available cash 
no gain or loss was recognized in connection with the redemption as the fair value of the senior subordinated notes recorded in connection with the merger equaled the redemption cost 
senior subordinated notes due in connection with the merger  we assumed million face amount  million fair value  of belco s senior subordinated notes due on november   approximately million face amount of these notes was tendered to us pursuant to the change of control provisions of the related indenture 
the tender price was equal to of the principal amount of each note plus accrued and unpaid interest as of october  including the premium and accrued interest  the total amount paid was million 
we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the repayment 
no gain or loss was recorded in connection with the redemption as the fair value of the senior subordinated notes recorded in connection with the merger equaled the redemption cost 
senior subordinated notes due on november   we completed the private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due pursuant to sec rule a 
proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs  were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
on march  we completed the exchange of these notes for new notes with substantially identical terms  except that the new notes are generally freely tradeable 
stock repurchase on september   the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
under this authorization  we have repurchased  shares at an average price of per share including broker commissions 
capital expenditures we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
our capital expenditures for were million  not including acquisitions 
we anticipate that our primary cash requirements for will include funding acquisitions  funding development projects and general working capital needs 
we will continue to seek opportunities for acquisitions of proved reserves with substantial exploitation and exploration potential 
the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions is inherently unpredictable and we therefore do not budget for them 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure activities  which include acquisition  development of and exploration on our oil and natural gas properties through cash flow from operations and available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that borrowings under the revolving credit facility  projected operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet the requirements of our business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
we cannot assure you that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to drilling results  product prices  industry conditions and outlook  and future acquisition of properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically enter into commodity price risk management  or cprm  transactions to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
cprm transactions may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
all cprm data is presented in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  accordingly  unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair market value of derivative contracts that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss and such amounts are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenues as the associated production occurs 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
while such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  management believes these contracts can be utilized as an effective component of cprm activities 
for  we recorded increases in operating revenues from non hedge cprm settlements in the amount of million  which includes million of cash settlements and non hedge change in fair value of derivatives of million 
for  we recorded a decrease in operating revenues from non hedge change in fair value of derivatives of million 
for  we recorded hedging settlement gains in the amount of million  which include cash losses of million and for and we recorded hedging settlement losses of million and million  respectively 
prior to the merger  belco entered into a substantial portion of its natural gas and crude oil commodity swap agreements and option agreements with enron north america corp  or ena  formerly known as enron capital trade resources corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron corp 
mr 
robert a 
belfer  one of our directors  is a member of the board of directors of enron corp 
and was the ceo of belco at the time these transactions were entered into 
these agreements were entered into in the ordinary course of business of belco and on terms that we believe were no less favorable to belco than the terms of similar arrangements with third parties 
old westport also entered into commodity price risk management agreements with ena prior to the merger 
pursuant to the terms of these agreements belco paid ena a net amount of approximately million in fiscal year and approximately million in old westport and westport received a net amount of million in from ena 
on november   we terminated our commodity derivative contracts with enron north america corp  or ena  formerly known as enron capital trade resources corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron corp 
we exercised our rights pursuant to the early termination provisions of such contracts as a result of ena s bankruptcy filing and related events 
we believe that we had the legal right to terminate these agreements  but ena may challenge our termination in bankruptcy court 
applying the mark to market and setoff methodology of our contracts with ena  we have calculated that we owed ena a net  for all hedging transactions outstanding under our ena contracts 
although we believe this methodology was correct  it is possible that ena will challenge our calculations and claim larger amounts are owed 
as of march   we have approximately million barrels of oil and bcf of natural gas subject to cprm contracts for the contracts have weighted average floor prices of per barrel and per mmbtu  with weighted average ceiling prices of per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively 
we have approximately million barrels of oil and bcf of natural gas subject to cprm contracts for the contracts for are at weighted average floor prices of per barrel and per mmbtu and weighted average ceiling prices of per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively 
these contracts represent our hedge and non hedge positions 
the tables below provide details about the volumes and prices of all open cprm commitments  hedge and non hedge  as of march  hedges gas price swaps sold receive fixed price thousand mmbtu  average price  per mmbtu collars sold thousand mmbtu   average floor price  per mmbtu average ceiling price  per mmbtu puts bought thousand mmbtu  average price per mmbtu oil price swaps sold receive fixed price mbbls   average price  per bbl collars sold mbbls  average floor price  per bbl average ceiling price  per bbl non hedges gas calls sold thousand mmbtu  average price per mmbtu oil calls sold mbbls  average price per bbl price swaps sold  receive fixed price mbbls   average price per bbl three way collars mbbls   three way average floor price average floor price per bbl average ceiling price per bbl for any particular swap sold transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport in the event that the nymex reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and westport is required to make a payment to the counterparty in the event that the nymex reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport if the average nymex reference price for the reference period is below the floor price for such transaction  and westport is required to make payment to the counterparty if the average nymex reference price is above the ceiling price of such transaction 
calls or puts are sold under written option contracts in return for a premium received by westport upon the initiation of the contract 
westport is required to make a payment to the counterparty in the event that the nymex reference price for any settlement period is greater than the price of the call sold  or less than the price of the put sold 
conversely  calls or puts bought in return for westport s payment of a premium require the counterparty to make a payment to westport in the event that the nymex reference price on any settlement period is greater than the call price or less than the put price 
three way collars are settled as described in footnote above  with the following exception if the nymex reference price falls below the three way floor price  the average floor price is reduced by the amount the nymex reference price is below the three way floor price 
for example  if the nymex reference price is per bbl during the term of the three way collars  then the average floor price would be per bbl 
interest rate swap agreements the following table summarizes the interest rate swap contracts we currently have in place notional amount transaction date expiration date current estimated rate million march march  million november september  libor million november november  libor we designated that the interest rate swap contracts entered into in november as fair value hedges of a portion of the senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
we did not designate the interest rate swap contract entered into in march as a hedge 
as of december   we recorded a derivative liability of million related to the interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges  with a corresponding debt discount 
for  we recorded other income of million related to the change in fair value of the non hedge interest rate swap outstanding at december  and two other non hedge interest rate swaps that settled prior to december
