impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

the company s commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  typically have fixed interest rates and amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a limited extent  nonresidential properties

prior to the acquisition of first american  the company sold such loans to texas independent bank mortgage company  however  since the first american acquisition  the company sells these loans directly into the secondary market 
as of december   the company s one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio was million 
of this amount  million is repriceable in one year or less and an additional million is repriceable from one year to five years 
these high percentages in short term real estate loans reflect the company s commitment to reducing interest rate risk 
the company provides a wide variety of consumer loans including motor vehicle  watercraft  education loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
as of december   the company had no indirect consumer loans  indicating a preference to maintain personal banking relationships and strict underwriting standards 
during the last several years  management has placed tighter controls on consumer credit due to record high personal bankruptcy filings nationwide 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial  industrial and real estate construction loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates in each maturity range as of december   are summarized in the following table december  one year or less after one through five years after five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate construction   total     loans with a predetermined interest rate    loans with a floating interest rate    total     nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
nonperforming assets at december   increased million or to million compared with million at december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of one loan in the amount of million 
a specific reserve has been assigned to this loan in an amount equal to the company s estimated loss exposure 
nonperforming assets were million at december  this resulted in ratios of nonperforming assets to total loans plus other real estate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases to accrue interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
loans where the interest payments jeopardize the collection of principal are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have been approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring  however  the company had no restructured loans or additional nonperforming interest earning assets at either december   december  or december  in addition to an internal loan review  the company retains ibs for an annual external review to evaluate the loan portfolio 
the company maintains current appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at fair value at the time of acquisition  less estimated costs to sell 
the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans   accruing loans past due days or more   other real estate total nonperforming assets     nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate the company considers a loan to be impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management has established an allowance for loan losses  which it believes  is adequate for estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security  the results of managements internal loan review  the evaluation of its loan portfolio through an annual external loan review conducted by ibs and the annual examination of the company s financial statements by its independent auditors 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company follows an internal loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans internally classified as substandard or in the more severe categories of doubtful or loss are those loans that  at a minimum  have clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to the classification of one million loan relationship and seven smaller loan relationships ranging from  to  specific reserves have been established based on the estimated exposure on these lines 
further  a more conservative problem asset identification process was implemented during whereas all loans past due greater than days are automatically added to the classified loan list unless the servicing loan officer provides written justification for removal 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   an increase of  or 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company establishes both specific and general reserves 
the company establishes specific allocations for the majority of problem loans based on the estimated exposure in each individual loan 
the exposure is generally identified by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows or the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the company establishes general reserves for non problem loans primarily based on its historical charge off experience 
consideration is also given to the level and trend of delinquent loans  loan growth  underwriting standards  economic conditions  and other qualitative factors based on management s judgment 
during  significant enhancements were made to the allowance methodology to better quantify these internal and external factors  resulting in an increase to general reserves of  compared to management actively monitors the company s asset quality and provides specific loss allowances when necessary 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations

the company continues to hold collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s in its securities portfolio 
a cmo is collateralized directly by mortgages or by mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
the company s investment in cmo s increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
the company also had an increase of million in mortgage backed securities from million at december  to million at december  the following table summarizes the amortized cost of investment securities held by the company as of the dates shown december  dollars in thousands us treasury securities us government securities    mortgage backed securities    cmos    equity securities    state and municipal securities    total securities    the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities on an amortized cost basis and their weighted average yields as of december  december  within one year after one year but within five years after five years but within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us treasury securities us government securities    mortgage backed securities     cmos    equity securities   state and municipal securities   totals    the company classifies debt and equity securities at the date of purchase into one of two categories held to maturity  or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
investments not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest  which are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
all the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were agency issued collateral obligations 
at december   of the mortgage backed and cmo securities held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed and cmo securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
therefore  the average life  or the average amount of time until the company receives the total amount invested  of the mortgage backed or cmo security will be shorter than the contractual maturity 
the company estimates the remaining average life of the fixed rate mortgage backed and cmo security portfolio to be less than five years 
these securities  when purchased at a premium  will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities when purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed and cmo securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average lives of these securities will not be unduly shortened 
approximately million of the company s mortgage backed and cmo securities earn interest at floating rates and reprice within one year  and accordingly are less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december  and million at december  the net change reflects an increase of  million or in fixed assets 
the increase is primarily due to the major remodeling of the commerce location  the purchase of a bank facility for the fort stockton location  and the purchase of additional furniture and computer hardware for the company offset by additional accumulated depreciation recorded for the year 
other assets on july   the company invested million in single insurance premium policies 
such policies insured the lives of certain key senior officers 
as of december   the net surrender values of these policies totaled million 
the company also recorded a receivable of million as of december  reflecting the pending settlement of its lawsuit against guaranty federal 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposit accounts consist of demand  savings  money market and time accounts

fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for two borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  called short term fixed  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from days 
the company does not currently have any borrowings under this program 
as of december   the company does not have any of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
the second borrowing program  the blanket borrowing program  is under a borrowing agreement which does not require the delivery of specific collateral 
borrowings are limited by the level of qualified  pledgable real estate loans held and fhlb stock owned 
at december   the company had approximately million borrowed of a potential million available under this program  leaving approximately million in available borrowings

fair values of financial instruments the estimated fair value approximates carrying value for financial instruments except those described below securities fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar instruments 
loans the fair value of fixed rate loans and variable rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality 
deposits the fair value of deposit liabilities with defined maturities and long term debt is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently offered for deposits or similar borrowings of similar remaining maturities 
off balance sheet instruments the fair values of these items are not material and are therefore not included on the following schedule 
the estimated year end fair values of financial instruments are detailed in the following table

capital resources and liquidity capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the tdb 
both the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for certain institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations

liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consisted mainly of growth in core deposits  supplemented by investment securities and earnings through operating activities 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
the company s capital ratios are greater than the minimums required by regulatory guidelines 
the company intends to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix 
at december   the company and the bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized 
the company s liquidity management objective is to meet maturing debt obligations  fund loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  and manage operations on a cost effective basis 
management believes that sufficient resources are available to meet the company s liquidity objective through its debt maturity structure  holdings of liquid assets  and access to the capital markets through a variety of funding vehicles 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
the bank s traditional funding sources consist primarily of core deposits  established federal funds lines with major banks  proceeds from matured investments  contracts to repurchase investment securities and principal and interest repayments on loans 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material negative effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material negative effect on the company 
industry segments the principal business of the company is overseeing the business of the bank 
the company has no significant assets other than its investment in the bank  therefore  the banking operation is the company s only reportable segment 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued two statements sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which will potentially impact the company s accounting for its reported goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling method for accounting for business combinations 
requires that intangible assets that meet certain criteria be reported separately from goodwill 
requires negative goodwill arising from a business combination to be recorded as an extraordinary gain 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles that are determined to have an indefinite life 
requires  at a minimum  annual impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life 
in the year ended december    and  the company recorded goodwill amortization expense of   and  in accordance with the new standards  recorded goodwill with the carrying amount of  at december  will no longer be subject to amortization beginning in fiscal year management believes that at january   there is no impairment of recorded goodwill 
also in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made  and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas  if applicable  will be adopted by the company upon its required effective date  for its fiscal year ended december  in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposition of long lived assets 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and by broadening the presentation of discounted operations to include primarily all disposal transactions 
it further establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale and establishes measurement criteria at the asset s or group of assets lower of unamortized cost or fair value at the date the asset is reclassified as held and used

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management  and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels in interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital based on the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  commitments to originate loans  and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses an interest rate shock simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
in addition to the simulation model  the alco monitors an interest rate shock report that shocks rates plus and minus basis points to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for the company 
at december   the company would experience a change in net earnings of  in a minus basis point shock and  in a plus basis point shock 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are utilized when they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not currently enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
however  it is management s intent to achieve a proper balance so that incorrect rate forecasts should not have a significant impact on earnings 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years greater than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities  loans        federal funds sold   total interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits      borrowed funds     total interest bearing liabilities      period gap       cumulative gap      period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the company s one year cumulative gap position at december   was negative million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
to better qualify and account for the variables not incorporated into gap analysis  the company utilizes an interest rate simulation model as discussed previously 
the company maintains a rate committee and the alco that reviews the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly or monthly basis  respectively
