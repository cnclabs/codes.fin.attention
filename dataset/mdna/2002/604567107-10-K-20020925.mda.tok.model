overview our predecessor  mips computer systems  inc  was founded in and was engaged in the design and development of reduced instruction set computing  or risc  processors for the computer systems and embedded markets 
silicon graphics adopted the mips architecture for its computer systems in and acquired mips computer systems  inc in following the acquisition  silicon graphics continued the mips processor business through its mips group a division of silicon graphics  which focused primarily on the development of high performance processors for silicon graphics workstations and servers 
until the mid s  cost considerations limited the use of mips risc processors in high volume digital consumer products 
as the cost to manufacture processors based on the mips technology decreased  the mips group sought to penetrate the consumer market  both through supporting and coordinating the efforts of the mips semiconductor licensees and  most notably  by partnering with nintendo in its design of the nintendo video game player and related cartridges 
in order to increase the focus of the mips group on the design and development of processor intellectual property for the embedded market  effective june   silicon graphics separated the business of the mips group from its other operations and transferred to us the assets and liabilities and intellectual property related to this business 
in the years immediately following our separation from sgi  most of our revenue came from royalties from nintendo products 
we anticipated that these royalties would decline over time and that our future growth would depend significantly on our ability to expand our contract revenues 
our research and development efforts have yielded several new products and we now have a broad processor core portfolio to offer to our customers 
this has resulted in an increase in the number of licenses completed in each of the past four years 
while  as expected  royalties declined in both and from the prior year due to the decline in nintendo royalties  contract revenues have not grown as rapidly as we have expected  and in fact declined in in order to resume growth in our contract revenues  we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in order to add new products to our portfolio offering  we expect to pursue additional relationships with third party independent software  hardware and ip vendors to add a broader range of development tools and we may increase our design services capabilities to provide an additional source of revenue 
our future growth will also be dependent on our receipt of meaningful royalties from customers who committed to our platform subsequent to the sgi spin off 
although we believe that in the latter half of fiscal we will begin to receive royalties from these relationships  we are not able to predict whether these royalties will be material 
revenue 
our revenue consists of royalties and contract revenue earned under contracts with our licensees 
our contracts with our licensees are typically subject to periodic renewal or extension and expire at various dates through june although the precise terms of our contracts vary  they typically provide for royalties  technology license or engineering service fees  and maintenance fees 
we generate royalties from the sale by our licensees of products incorporating our technology 
royalty revenue is recognized in the quarter in which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of products incorporating our intellectual property  which is in the quarter following the sale of the licensee s product to its customer 
royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenue received by the seller on sales of such products or on a per unit basis 
contract revenue includes technology license fees and engineering services fees 
we receive license fees for the use of technology that we have developed internally and  in some cases  which we have licensed from third parties 
license fees are typically recognized upon the execution of the license agreement and transfer of intellectual property  provided no further significant performance obligations exist and collectibility is deemed probable 
technology license fees vary based on  among other things  whether a particular technology is licensed for a single application or for multiple or unlimited applications  and whether the license granted covers a particular design or a broader architecture 
fees related to engineering services contracts  which are performed on a best efforts basis and for which we receive periodic milestone payments  are recognized as revenue over the estimated development period using a cost based percentage of completion method 
in most instances  the technology we develop  including under engineering services contracts  can be licensed to multiple customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but effective to july   we changed our method of accounting to that described above for fees related to engineering services contracts 
we historically recognized these fees as revenue when all of the contractual obligations required to earn each milestone payment had been met  there were no further performance obligations for such milestone  and collection was deemed probable 
we believe the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  released in december as a result of this change in method of accounting  we recorded in fiscal a charge of million  net of tax effect to reflect the cumulative effect of the change on prior years  calculated as of july  during fiscal year  we recorded million in contract revenue that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of july  during fiscal year  we recorded no contract revenue that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of july  the pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations were calculated assuming the change was made retroactive to prior periods 
in fiscal  royalties accounted for approximately of our total revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal royalties from nintendo and nec on sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal  of our total revenue for fiscal  and of our total revenue for fiscal current royalties received from nintendo are based on unit sales of nintendo video game cartridges 
in addition  we receive royalties from nec based on a percentage of the revenue derived by nec from sales of the processor included in the nintendo video game player 
the most recently introduced nintendo video game system does not incorporate any of our technology 
revenues related to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges have declined significantly during the past fiscal year and were insignificant by the end of fiscal as a result of the decline in nintendo royalties  we expect that contract revenue will account for more than of our total revenue for the next year 
although a substantial portion of our total revenue in prior fiscal years was derived from royalties relating to sales of nintendo video game products  we expect that royalties and contract revenue related to the development and sales of other digital consumer products  such as handheld mobile devices  smart cards and set top boxes  as well as other video game products  will constitute an increasingly significant portion of our total revenue 
our ability to diversify our revenue base will depend primarily on the number and variety of design wins we obtain from digital consumer product and business equipment manufacturers  and consumer acceptance of products that incorporate our technology 
we generally do not have a direct contractual relationship with digital consumer product manufacturers  and the royalty reports submitted by our licensees generally do not disclose which consumer products include our risc technology 
as a result  it is difficult for us to identify or predict the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon a particular digital consumer product or product manufacturer 
prior to fiscal  we realized a disproportionate amount of our revenue and operating income in our third fiscal quarter because a disproportionate amount of nintendo video game cartridges are typically sold in the second fiscal quarter which includes the holiday selling season 
however  as a result of the decline in nintendo royalties and the revenue mix shift to contract revenue accounting for the majority of total revenue  the seasonal increase in revenue did not occur in fiscal  and we do not expect to experience  to the extent we have in the past  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 
our revenue is derived from a global customer base 
to date  companies based in japan have accounted for the substantial portion of our total revenue 
we have an existing sales office in japan and we have sales offices in france  germany and the united kingdom in order to expand and diversify our customer base in europe 
during fiscal we opened sales offices in taiwan and israel to better serve our customers and potential customers in those locations 
further  most of our international licensees have customers worldwide including those based in the united states 
international revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal substantially all of this revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
we expect that revenue derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses generally include cost of contract revenue  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of contract revenue 
cost of contract revenue consists of sublicense fees 
we incur an obligation to pay these fees when we sublicense to our customers technology that we have licensed from third parties 
sublicense fees are recognized as cost of contract revenue when the obligation is incurred  which is typically the same period in which the related revenue is recognized 
research and development 
research and development expenses include salaries and contractor and consultant fees  as well as costs related to workstations  software  and computer aided design tools 
the costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as they are incurred and are not directly related to any particular licensee  license agreement or license fee 
research and development expense also includes the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
in december  we acquired from lexra  inc certain technology related to our processor architectures  which consisted of developed technology for which we recorded a valuation of million and core technology for which we recorded a valuation of million 
developed and core technologies are being amortized and charged to research and development expense  on a straight line basis  over their estimated useful lives of three and seven years  respectively 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and costs associated with third party independent software development tools  direct marketing and other marketing efforts 
our sales and marketing efforts are directed at establishing and supporting our licensing relationships 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses comprise salaries  legal fees including those associated with the establishment and protection of our patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights which are integral to our business and expenses related to compliance with the reporting and other requirements of a publicly traded company 
between and  certain facilities services were provided to us pursuant to an agreement with silicon graphics 
our general and administrative expenses have grown substantially since the separation from silicon graphics due to costs related to our status as a stand alone entity 
critical accounting polices and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our accounting estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results inevitably will differ from the estimates  and such differences may require material adjustments to our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
contract revenue includes technology license or engineering service fees and maintenance fees 
license fees are recognized upon the execution of the license agreement and transfer of intellectual property  provided no further significant performance obligations exist and collectibility is deemed probable 
we assess the credit worthiness of each customer at the time the license agreement is executed or when a transaction under the agreement occurs 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
fees related to engineering services contracts  which are performed on a best efforts basis  are recognized as revenue over the estimated development period using a cost based percentage of completion method limited to the amount of the milestone payments attained under each agreement 
upon the execution of each engineering services contract  we estimate the engineering resources required to complete the development effort 
we regularly review the estimated cost of development  as the development effort is subject to change due to changes in engineering schedules  resource availability and in some instances deliverable requirements from the licensee or third parties 
to the extent the revised estimated costs of development are less than the original estimate  the engineering service fee recognized would be accelerated to the revised percentage of completion in the period in which the adjustment occurred 
conversely  if the revised estimated costs of development are more than the original estimate  the engineering service fee recognized would be adjusted to the revised percentage of completion in the period in which the adjustment occurred 
to date  adjustments have not been significant 
intangible assets 
we make estimates when we acquire businesses or otherwise acquire groups of assets for a single aggregate price 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
the amounts and useful lives  generally to years  assigned to tangible and intangible assets  other than ipr d  impact future amortization  the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are subsequently revised in light of new circumstances  purchase price adjustments  which could impact future amortization of acquired assets  or asset impairment charges  could be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable or that the estimated useful life of the asset has changed 
in order to judge the carrying value of an asset or the remaining useful life of an asset  we make various assumptions about the value of the asset in the future 
this may include assumptions about future prospects for the products to which the asset relates and typically involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these products 
if such assets are deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in business strategy and our internal forecasts 
to date  we have not determined that any assets are impaired 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  allowances must be established 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
results of operation years ended june   and revenue 
our revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year royalties contract revenue total revenue million million million million million million million million million total revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract revenue 
total revenue decreased by million in fiscal due to a decrease in both royalties and contract revenue 
total revenue decreased by million in fiscal due to a decrease in royalty revenue that was offset in part by an increase in contract revenue 
royalties for fiscal  and consisted of royalties from sale by licensees of products incorporating our technology and from sales of nintendo video cartridges 
total royalties decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal due primarily to a decline in royalties from nintendo products 
in addition  in fiscal  non nintendo royalties declined by  due to the impact of slower economic conditions on our licensees 
in fiscal  there was a increase in non nintendo royalties 
contract revenue for fiscal  and consisted of fees generated from new license agreements entered into during these periods  and included engineering service fees earned 
although we entered into new license agreements in fiscal  contract revenue decreased by million primarily due to lower revenue recognized from engineering service fees and unlimited use licenses  and  to a lesser extent  lower revenue recognized from per use licenses than in fiscal engineering service fees decreased because we had fewer products licensed in the development phase than in the prior period 
both unlimited use and per use license revenue decreased due to our licenses in fiscal covering proportionately more of our lower end cores as compared to fiscal contract revenue in fiscal increased as we entered into new agreements with new and existing licensees and we recognized more revenue from engineering service fees and unlimited and per use licenses than in fiscal engineering service fees increased in because there were more licensed projects in the development phase and more projects were completed than in the prior period 
per use and unlimited use fees increased in due to an increase in available products as more projects were completed than in the prior year 
cost of contract revenue 
our costs of contract revenue in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue in fiscal  and was attributable to sublicense fees 
we believe that future cost of contract revenue will continue to be immaterial in relation to total revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year research and development expenses million million million research and development expenses in fiscal increased by  primarily due to an increase in salary levels  offset by a decrease in our requirement for contractors and outside testing services needed to meet project milestones 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in fiscal from fiscal reflects the additional resources needed to staff and support new development projects 
our research and development staff declined to persons at june   from persons at june  and consisted of persons at june  although we will continue to invest in our research and development efforts  we intend to closely manage our spending levels  including research and development  relative to current and projected revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year sales and marketing expenses million million million the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million in fiscal was primarily due to increased spending on third party software development tools as we partner with tool vendors to enhance the offering of mips compatible development tools such as compilers  debuggers  probes and operating systems 
expenses associated with third party tools are typically driven by the third party s attainment of specified milestones and vary from period to period 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in headcount in support of our licensing revenue growth and an increase in product and industry marketing activities 
our sales and marketing staff remained the same at persons at june  compared to june   and up from persons at june  we expect that our sales and marketing staff and related expenses will remain relatively stable as we continue to manage our spending levels relative to our revenue expectations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year general and administrative expenses million million million the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily because of our outsourcing fewer administrative projects to third party legal and accounting firms  decreases in bonus payments  and reduced cost of litigation due to the settlement of the lexra litigation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflects increases in our outside legal and administrative resources necessary to support our expansion in the marketplace 
this includes increases in expenses related to the establishment and protection of our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights which are integral to our business  as well as costs associated with the regulatory and reporting requirements of a public company with several international locations 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will remain relatively stable in the near future 
in process research and development 
in december  we acquired from lexra  inc certain technology related to our processor architectures and cores  and we recorded a charge of million for purchased in process research and development expenses upon acquisition of the technology 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses for the technology existed 
the value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows management believed would result from the acquired technology 
restructuring costs 
the restructuring charge of  recorded during the second quarter of fiscal is comprised of employee severance and benefit payments 
we eliminated regular positions  or about of our global workforce  with the objective of reducing our operating expenses to be more in line with our revenue projections 
all of the severance and benefit costs associated with the positions eliminated were paid by january if anticipated revenue levels are not achieved  we may decide to engage in additional restructuring activities  which could result in additional restructuring charges 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decline in interest income in fiscal is primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our short term investments and cash equivalents and lower cash and investment balances 
income taxes 
we recorded a benefit provision for income taxes of  in fiscal based on an estimated federal and state combined rate of 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal based on an estimated federal and state combined rate of 
the reduction in the federal and state combined benefit rate to in fiscal was due primarily to operating losses offset by foreign losses which were not benefited 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal based on a federal and state combined rate of on income before taxes 
the reduction in the federal and state combined rate to in fiscal from in fiscal was due primarily to increased research and development credits and a reduction of unbenefited foreign losses 
impact of currency certain of our international licensees pay royalties based on revenues that are reported in a local currency currently yen and translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect when such revenues are reported by the licensee 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that sales by our manufacturing licensees are denominated in foreign currencies  royalties we receive on such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
liquidity and capital resources our principal requirements for cash are to fund working capital needs  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities used cash of million due to our net loss  offset in part by depreciation  increases in prepaid and other current assets  an increase in other long term assets  and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
the increase in prepaids is primarily due to an increase in prepaid maintenance for computer aided design tools  an increase in income taxes receivable pertaining to certain tax credits and refunds we have applied for  and increased prepaid insurance 
the increase in other long term assets is due to the long term portion of computer aided design tool licenses 
an increasing number of our computer aided design tools are now secured through term licenses of three to seven years 
in the past  the majority of our tools were acquired through the purchases of perpetual licenses  which were recorded as capital assets 
the decrease in accrued liabilities is due to a reduction in taxes payable resulting from our net loss and tax payments made during the year  and a decrease in accrued bonuses 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities provided cash of million  primarily due to net income  depreciation  and decreases in accounts receivable and an increase in other liabilities 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to a decrease in the number of licensing agreements completed near the end of fiscal the increase in other liabilities was due to fluctuations in taxes payable 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities provided cash of million  primarily reflecting net income  depreciation and an increase in accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to amounts owed to us under new license agreements entered into during the period 
the decrease in accounts payable was the result of a payment to silicon graphics for taxes accrued at june  the increase in accrued liabilities is attributable to an increase in income taxes payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal includes purchases  net of maturities of short term investments as well as purchases of equipment and computer aided design tools used in development  in addition to the purchase price for intangible assets acquired from lexra  inc  and a small equity interest in lexra  inc 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and consisted of equipment purchases and licensing of computer aided design tools used in our development activities 
capital expenditures have been  and future expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for facilities and equipment to support expansion of our operations and licensing of computer aided design tools used in development 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for all periods presented consisted primarily of net cash proceeds to us from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plans 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including  among others the cost  timing and success of product development efforts  the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new technologies gain market acceptance  the level and timing of contract revenues and royalties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
moreover  strategic relationships  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require that we relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
on june   silicon graphics distributed all of the shares of our common stock that it owned in a transaction intended to be tax free to silicon graphics and its stockholders 
our ability to issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions or to raise equity capital during the month period following this distribution will be limited under the terms of a distribution tax indemnification agreement  which we have entered into with silicon graphics 
the agreement contains covenants under which we may not issue capital stock in an acquisition or private or public offering through december  except a pursuant to the exercise of employee  director or consultant stock options or awards and b for the issuance of up to a cumulative amount of of our outstanding stock at the time of the tax free distribution unless certain conditions are met 
factors that may affect our business our success is subject to numerous risk and uncertainties  including those discussed below 
these factors could hinder our growth  cause us to sustain losses or have other adverse effects on us  all of which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations that could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly financial results may vary significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our revenue components are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
because our expenses are largely independent of our revenue in any particular period  it is difficult to accurately forecast our operating results 
our operating expenses are based  in part  on anticipated future revenue and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue is below expectations in any quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
therefore  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock may fall 
factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include the demand for and average selling prices of semiconductor products that incorporate our technology  the financial terms and delivery schedules of our contractual arrangements with our licensees  which may provide for significant up front payments  payments based on the achievement of certain milestones or extended payment terms  the relative mix of contract revenue and royalties  competitive pressures resulting in lower contract revenue or royalty rates  our ability to develop  introduce and market new processor intellectual property  the establishment or loss of licensing relationships with semiconductor companies or digital consumer and business product manufacturers  the timing of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in development schedules  research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and digital consumer and business product manufacturers  uncertain economic and market conditions 
we may not experience growth in our contract revenue 
a significant portion of our total revenues are generated by license fees paid for access to our technology 
we characterize license fees  along with engineering service fees  as contract revenue 
in recent years  contract revenues have represented an increasingly greater percentage of total revenues 
our contract revenue declined in fiscal while we expect that we will continue to grant additional licenses to new licensees and develop new products to license to both new and existing licensees  we cannot predict when  or if  contract revenue will resume its growth 
our licensees are not obligated to license new or future generations of our products  so past contract revenue may not be indicative of the amount of such revenue in any future period 
we depend on design wins to expand our revenue base 
in the past  a substantial portion of our total revenues was generated by royalties from nintendo and nec relating to nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
as expected  these royalties have declined substantially and are now insignificant 
our ability to reverse our decline in revenues is uncertain and will depend in large part on whether our processors and related designs are selected by our licensees and their customers for design  which we refer to as design wins  into a broader range of both digital consumer and business products 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to several risks and uncertainties  including the potentially limited opportunities for design wins with respect to certain digital consumer products  such as video game products  due to a limited number of product manufacturers and the length of product life cycles  and the risk that the performance  functionality  price and power characteristics of our designs may not satisfy those that are critical to specific digital consumer and business product applications 
even if our technology is incorporated into new products  we cannot be certain that any such products will ultimately be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalties for us 
we depend on royalties from the sale of products incorporating our technology  and we have limited visibility as to the timing and amount of such sales 
our success in achieving design wins with our customers does not assure us of future revenue  as our revenue from these customers depends on our receipt of royalties from the sales of products that use our technology 
frequently these sales are based on the sales of products incorporating the semiconductors or other products of our licensees  and as a result we do not have direct access to information that will help us anticipate the timing and amount of future royalties 
our success is linked to the success of our licensees and  in the case of our semiconductor company licensees  the success of their customers 
factors that negatively affect our licensees and their customers could adversely affect our business 
the success of our direct and indirect customers is subject to a number of factors  including the competition these companies face and the market acceptance of their products  the engineering  marketing and management capabilities of these companies and technical challenges unrelated to our technology that they face in developing their products  their financial and other resources 
because we do not control the business practices of our licensees and their customers  we have little influence on the degree to which our licensees promote our technology and do not set the prices at which products incorporating our technology are sold 
we depend on semiconductor companies and digital consumer and business product manufacturers to adopt our technology and use it in the products they sell 
the adoption and continued use of our technology by semiconductor companies and digital consumer and business product manufacturers is essential to our continued success 
we face numerous risks in obtaining agreements with semiconductor companies and digital consumer and business product manufacturers on acceptable terms  including potential competition with the internal design teams of semiconductor companies and digital consumer and business product manufacturers  competition from other semiconductor intellectual property providers  potential difficulties in persuading large semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary manufacturing technology  and potential difficulties in persuading potential licensees to bear certain development costs associated with our technology and to produce embedded processors using our technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional licensees  and any failure by us to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may devote substantial resources to the pursuit of a relationship with a potential licensee that ultimately is not successful 
we depend on the emerging markets for digital consumer and business products and customer acceptance of the products that integrate our technology 
the digital consumer and business products industries are presently the primary market for our processor  core and related designs 
the markets for digital consumer and business products are relatively new and emerging  and our success will depend largely on the level of interest in digital consumer and business products  many of which have only recently been introduced to the market 
for us to grow  it is necessary that a significant number of additional products incorporating our technology be developed and successfully marketed 
further  customer acceptance of both consumer and business products may be hampered during periods of general economic uncertainty  as many consumers and businesses might delay their purchase decisions 
we cannot assure you that any products that incorporate our technology will achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalties for us 
our dependence on the digital consumer and business products industries involves several risks and uncertainties  including changes in customer requirements and preferences  the introduction of products by our competitors embodying new technologies or features  and the current lack of open industry standards for hardware and software in digital consumer and business products 
if we are unable to develop enhancements and new generations of our intellectual property  we may be unable to achieve design wins 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop enhancements and new generations of our processors  cores and other intellectual property that satisfy the requirements of specific product applications and introduce these new technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  or if the characteristics of our processor  core and related designs are not compatible with the requirements of specific product applications  our ability to achieve design wins may be limited 
our failure to achieve a significant number of design wins would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
technical innovations of the type critical to our success are inherently complex and involve several risks  including our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in the requirements of semiconductor companies  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  of digital consumer and business products  our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes  changing customer preferences in the digital consumer and business products markets  the emergence of new standards in the semiconductor industry and for digital consumer and business products  the significant investment in a potential product that is often required before commercial viability is determined  and the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
our failure to adequately address these risks could render our existing processor  core and related designs obsolete and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial and other resources necessary to develop processor  core and related designs in the future  or that any enhancements or new generations of the technology that we develop will generate revenue in excess of or sufficient to cover the costs of development 
if we fail to compete effectively in the market for embedded processors  our business will be adversely affected 
competition in the market for embedded processors is intense 
our products compete with those of other designers and developers of processors and cores  as well as those of semiconductor manufacturers whose product lines include processors for embedded and non embedded applications 
in addition  we may face competition from the producers of unauthorized mips based clones and non risc based technology designs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in order to be successful in marketing our products to semiconductor companies  we must differentiate our processors  cores and related designs from those available or under development by the internal design groups of these companies  including some of our current and prospective licensees 
many of these internal design groups have substantial engineering and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources 
these internal design groups may develop products that compete with ours 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases as well as greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their technologies and products 
we may encounter difficulties with future acquisitions  which could harm our business 
as part of our business strategy  in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses or technologies that we believe can complement or expand our business  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
although our tax indemnification agreement with silicon graphics limits the amount of our capital stock that we can issue in acquisition transactions  this limitation will cease to apply beginning on december  any future acquisitions may require debt or equity financing  or the issuance of shares in the transaction  any of which could increase our leverage or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions on terms that are acceptable  or at all 
we may incur charges related to acquisitions or investments that are completed 
for instance  we recorded a million in process research and development charge in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of our acquisition of certain technology 
we will also face challenges integrating acquired businesses and operations and assimilating and managing the personnel of the acquired operations 
the difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances 
the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  exposure to unanticipated contingent liabilities of acquired companies  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition and or operate the acquired business 
any of these and other factors could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition 
we may also make investments in other companies  particularly private companies  such as the investment we made in the second quarter of fiscal  where we feel these investments offer strategic opportunities 
these investments tend to be inherently risky because the companies are frequently in the development stage and depend on future third party investments to finance their operations 
if the companies in which we invest do not secure the requisite financing or secure it at a lower enterprise valuation than was in effect when we invested  we may be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment 
we have recorded long lived assets  and our results of operations would be adversely affected if their value becomes impaired 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain core and developed technologies and allocated approximately million of the purchase price to these long lived assets  which amount is being amortized over schedules based on the useful lives of the technology acquired 
if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  our purchased intangible assets amortization charge could increase and we may also be required to record substantial amounts of goodwill 
as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate our long lived assets  including purchased assets  for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in the future  if we determine that our long lived assets are impaired  we will have to recognize additional charges for this impairment 
while we do not currently expect to need to record long lived assets impairment charges  we cannot be sure that we will not be required to do so in the future 
we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future  which could harm our results of operations 
in fiscal  we completed a restructuring of our operations by eliminating of our global workforce 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of  during the second quarter of fiscal we cannot assure you this change in our operations will be sufficient to appropriately align our operating expenses with our revenue expectations 
if we have not sufficiently reduced operating expenses  we may be required to engage in additional restructuring activities  that could result in additional restructuring charges 
further  recent accounting pronouncements may affect the timing of recording any future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recorded 
these restructuring charges could harm our results of operations 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent other parties from designing and marketing unauthorized mips based products or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies as ours 
moreover  cross licensing arrangements  in which we license certain of our patents but do not generally transfer know how or other proprietary information  may facilitate the ability of cross licensees  either alone or in conjunction with others  to develop competitive products and designs 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved or that any of the patents or other intellectual property rights that we own or use will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others or be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry 
we cannot be certain that third parties will not make a claim of infringement against us  our licensees  or our licensees customers in connection with use of our technology 
any claims  even those without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us or one of our licensees in connection with its use of our technology could adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on investments of our excess cash 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
to achieve this objective and minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in high quality short term maturity commercial paper  municipal bonds  and money market funds operated by reputable financial institutions in the united states 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that we do not have a material interest rate risk exposure 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a substantial portion of our revenue has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from customers outside the united states  primarily in japan 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
because we cannot predict the amount of non us dollar denominated revenue earned by our licensees  we have not historically attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our revenue  and we do not presently intend to do so in the future
