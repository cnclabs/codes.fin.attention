and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loans and leases are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the payment of principal and or interest is past due days or more 
however  installment loans and consumer leases are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are charged off in the month the loans and leases reach days past due 
in addition  loans that are well secured and in the process of collection are not placed on nonaccrual status 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest income previously recognized that has not been received is reversed 
future interest income is recorded only when a payment is received and collection of principal is considered reasonably assured 
although loans and leases may be classified as nonaccrual  many continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than the original contractual rates 
the gross amount of interest income recognized during with respect to these loans and leases was 
million compared to million that would have been recognized had the loans and leases remained current in accordance with their original terms 
nonaccrual loans increased million during the increase was composed of million of additions to nonaccrual loans  million of payments on nonaccrual loans  million of nonaccrual loans charged off and million transferred to other real estate and equipment owned 
other real estate and equipment owned increased million during activity in other real estate and equipment owned included million of additions from foreclosed properties and equipment  million of charge offs on property and equipment and million of sales and payments on properties 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans was due primarily to the deteriorating economic environment  particularly the airline industry 
the increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans is due to residential loans remaining on the balance sheet rather than being securitized and sold 
originations since july are being sold on a whole loan basis

management s determination of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve is based on an assessment of the losses given the conditions at the time 
this assessment consists of certain loans and leases being evaluated on an individual basis  as well as all loans and leases being categorized based on common credit risk attributes and being evaluated as a group 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provident s credit administration group is responsible for the establishment and oversight of provident s credit risk policies 
the credit risk policies address underwriting standards  internal lending limits and methodologies for the monitoring of credit risk within the various loan and lease portfolios 
loans and leases are primarily monitored by closely following changes and trends in assigned risk ratings 
credit scoring models are used for consumer and small business loans and leases  while larger commercial  commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans are assigned individual risk ratings 
these ratings are assigned based upon individual credit analysis and are reported to senior management on a regular basis 
loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status are further evaluated for potential losses based upon review and discussion among lending officers  credit  loan review  collection associates  and senior management 
factors considered include the market value of collateral or real estate associated with a specific loan or lease  cash flows generated by the borrower  third party guarantees  the general economic climate and any specific industry trends that may affect an individual loan or lease 
total nonaccrual loans at december  were million 
in addition  million of performing loans were being closely monitored due to possible credit problems 
the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses is monitored on a continual basis and is based upon management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  payment histories  collateral valuations  historical charge off and recovery experience  estimates of charge offs for the upcoming year and other pertinent information 
additional loss estimates associated with securitized assets are provided for separately from the reserve for loan and lease losses

these higher credit costs had a materially unfavorable impact on net income 
management expects credit costs to decline substantially in to address asset quality issues and related credit costs that arose during  management is working to improve its internal credit processes and resolve asset quality concerns in its loan and lease portfolios 
however  if credit costs do not substantially decline  this could impact provident s ability to maintain the payment of its quarterly dividend rate at current levels

receivables from securitization trusts were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
provident had provided for credit enhancements to its securitizations structured as sales in the form of reserve accounts 
the reserve accounts had been maintained at a significantly higher balance than the level of estimated credit losses to improve the credit grade of the securitization and thereby reduce the rate paid to investors of the securitization trust 
credit losses have been absorbed directly into these reserve accounts 
provident estimates the amount of all credit losses based upon loan credit grades  collateral  market conditions and other pertinent factors 
receivables from securitization trusts are shown net of these loss estimates 
the decrease in receivables from securitization trusts is a result of the reserve accounts on the nonconforming residential loan securitizations being released 
credit enhancements on these securitizations now are in the form of an unfunded demand note backed by a aaa rated standby letter of credit 
actual losses  which have been reserved for  are submitted on a monthly basis to provident by the trustee 
should provident fail to reimburse the trustee for these monthly losses  the letter of credit can be drawn upon 
there are no conditions that can accelerate this monthly process 
other assets increased million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to an increase in servicer advances on sold loans  and a receivable resulting from the sale of an investment security that did not settle until the first week of january 
the increase in was primarily the result of an increase in capitalized servicing assets 
the value of capitalized servicing rights are recorded when loans are sold with servicing retained or when loan servicing is purchased 
the value of these capitalized servicing rights is amortized over the period of estimated net servicing revenue  with the carrying value of these rights being periodically reviewed for impairment 
included in other assets is goodwill and other intangible assets totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
provident will apply the new rules beginning in application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of million  or six cents per share  provident financial group  inc

during  retail deposits increased to billion at december  from billion at december   with significant contribution from internet deposit gathering initiatives 
offsetting this increase was a million decrease of deposits from securitization trusts held at provident 
the increase in deposits in was primarily attributable to the growth in certificates of deposit 
the following table presents a summary of period end deposit balances december  in millions noninterest bearing deposits of securitization trusts other noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits    certificates of deposit less than     certificates of deposit of  or more    at december   maturities on certificates of deposit of  or more were as follows in millions months or less over through months over through months over months  total  included in certificates of deposit of  or more at december   and were brokered deposits of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
provident issues brokered certificates of deposit with embedded call options combined with interest rate swaps with matching call dates as part of its certificate of deposit program 
provident has the right to redeem the certificates of deposit on specific dates prior to their stated maturity while the interest rate swaps are callable at the option of the swap counterparty 
the terms and conditions of the call options embedded in the interest rate swaps match those of the certificates of deposit  offsetting any option risk exposure to provident

in  short term debt increased billion and long term debt increased million 
increases in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements were the primary reasons for the increase in short term debt 
securitizations consummated since the third quarter of have been structured to account for the transactions as secured financings 
the primary reason for the increase in long term debt was an increase in debt issued as secured financings 
during the first quarter of  provident established provident capital trust iv

 see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset securitization activity from through the second quarter of  the structure of many of provident s securitizations resulted in the transactions being accounted for as sales 
as such  gains or losses were recognized  loans and leases were removed from the balance sheet and residual assets  representing the present value of future cash flows  were recorded 
while the performance of provident s residual assets have generally been better than or consistent with their initial estimates  other companies utilizing securitization structures requiring gain on sale accounting experienced problems and consequently  the market penalized all companies using gain on sale accounting 
although gain on sale accounting is in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the investment community clearly signaled its dissatisfaction with this accounting method and management believed this sentiment had been factored into provident s stock price 
additionally  newly issued regulatory guidelines regarding securitization activity discourage the use of gain on sale accounting by limiting the amount of residual assets that can be included as part of regulatory capital 
see note of the notes to consolidated provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial statements for further details of the revised regulatory rules 
as a result of these factors  provident decided that securitizations during the third quarter of and thereafter would be structured as secured financings thereby eliminating the use of gain on sale accounting 
the switch to a secured financing structure does not affect the total profit provident will recognize over the life of the asset  but rather impacts the timing of income recognition 
secured financing transactions  on a comparative basis  cause reported earnings from securitized assets to be lower in the initial periods and higher in later periods  as interest is earned on the assets 
as a result  moving away from transaction structures that use gain on sale accounting causes provident s earnings to be lower over the short term 
securitizations which were treated as sales have made a significant impact on provident s financial condition and results of operations 
the following discusses this impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets 
impact on consolidated statements of income based on the asset type  terms and structure of the securitization transaction  a gain may be recognized immediately upon the sale of the assets and or income is recognized throughout the life of the securitization 
the following table provides a summary of principal securitized and gains recognized for the various types of securitization structures during the past three years in thousands principal gain principal gain principal gain structured as sales non cash gains nonconforming residential   prime home equity   credit card cash gains equipment leases   non recognition of gains automobile leases n a n a  n a warehouse lending n a n a  n a n a n a  n a total sales   structured as secured financings nonconforming residential  n a  n a n a prime home equity  n a  n a n a equipment leases n a  n a n a automobile leases  n a  n a n a total secured financings  n a  n a n a provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the securitization and sale of nonconforming residential  prime home equity and credit card loans have resulted in the recognition of non cash gains 
gains recognized under this structure are referred to as non cash gains as provident receives cash equal to the amount of loans sold 
the gains or losses are determined based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of interest payments to security holders  loan loss and prepayment assumptions and normal servicing revenue 
these net cash flows  which are represented by retained interests on securitized assets risas  are included in investment securities 
no risas have been recorded since june cash gains have been recognized from the securitization and sale of equipment leases 
under the structure of these securitizations  provident sells the lease payments under the lease contract but retains ownership of the underlying equipment 
the cash received from these sales exceeds the present value of the lease payments and generates the cash gain 
the securitization of automobile leases results in the recognition of operating lease income or expense 
under the structure of the securitization of the automobile leases  provident enters into a sale leaseback arrangement with the investors 
lease payments paid by provident to the investor may be more or less than that received by provident from the consumer 
credit losses are accrued at an annual rate of basis points 
the difference in the lease payments  net of credit losses and servicing fees  is recognized as net operating lease income or expense over the life of the securitization 
for the years ended december   and  net operating lease income recognized on these automobile lease securitizations was million  million and million  respectively

provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provident retained the servicing of the loans and leases it securitized and the servicing on the majority of loans it sells on a whole loan basis 
as a result  a significant level of assets is serviced by provident  which do not appear on its balance sheet 
these off balance sheet assets were primarily responsible for the generation of million  million and million in loan servicing fees during  and  respectively 
impact on consolidated balance sheets the impact from the securitization and sale of various loans and leases can be seen in several areas of provident s balance sheet 
the most significant area has been the removal of loans and leases that provident continues to service

red capital has established reserves of approximately million for possible losses under this program 
the reserve is determined by evaluating pools of homogenous loans and includes information based upon industry and historical loss experience  as well as each project s recent operating performance 
management believes the reserve is maintained at a level that adequately provides for the inherent losses within red capital s portfolio of dus loans 
the employees and management team of red capital have originated and serviced the existing fannie mae dus loan servicing portfolio since without any losses relating to the dus loans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the responsibility of monitoring and managing market and liquidity risk at provident is assigned to the asset liability committee alco 
the market and liquidity risk unit provides alco with the necessary analyses and reports 
the main source of market risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial instruments that may result from the changes in interest rates 
alco is bound to guidelines stated in the relevant policies approved by the board of directors 
in addition  alco is responsible for liquidity risk management 
provident offers a wide variety of retail deposit products to provide a stable funding source for loan growth 
to supplement its retail deposits  provident utilizes various sources of wholesale funding 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank and offering short and medium term deposits via brokerage investors are part of this strategy 
asset securitizations treated as secured financings provide funding for the origination of additional loans and leases 
through term and commercial paper conduit markets  provident has the ability to take advantage of the liquid asset backed securities market 
interest rate risk management guidelines and policies are approved by the board of directors 
alco is responsible for monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of both the balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the market and liquidity risk unit  as an extension of alco  utilizes asset liability simulation to monitor interest rate risk 
the simulation model measures the impact on net interest income due to changes in the yield curve  and performs stress tests on net interest income 
the interest rate risk policy specifically states the boundaries for the percentage changes in net interest income 
the board of directors also approves the limits for changes in the market value of equity 
this is the change in the difference between the discounted value of assets and the discounted value of liabilities 
the impairment or the improvement is measured as a percentage of total assets 
again  the market and liquidity risk unit monitors this ratio on a monthly basis 
in addition to natural balance sheet hedges  alco utilizes derivatives instruments to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps are the most widely used tool to manage interest rate risk  but from time to time  interest rate caps and floors may also be utilized 
provident has used derivatives effectively for a number of years and has developed the necessary expertise and knowledge to achieve a safe and sound interest rate risk management process
