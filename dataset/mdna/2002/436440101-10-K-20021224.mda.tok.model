item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and only perfunctory obligations included in the arrangement remain to be completed 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for shipments that require more than perfunctory obligations at the time of shipment  specifically for our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at the time of revenue recognition for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
our products are generally covered for a one year period from the date of installation 
we test the adequacy of our warranty reserves quarterly by reviewing our most recent warranty repair experience by product 
our product failure rates and service delivery costs have been consistent over the past three fiscal years for our continuing product lines 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in this accrual over the past three fiscal years is directly attributable to our decision to eliminate the unprofitable conventional general radiography product lines which had warranty periods of up to five years 
service and other revenues  which primarily includes maintenance contracts  replacement parts and services and fee per scan revenues are recorded ratably over the contract period for maintenance contracts  at the time of shipment for replacement parts  as the service is rendered or as the fees are collected for fee per scan revenue 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  which may negatively affect our ability to dispose of inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we perform a specific bad debt review on a quarterly basis to determine the amount of reserve required based on the outstanding balance due and the age of the balance 
we also provide a general reserve to cover items not specifically reviewed 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve in fiscal was primarily attributable to our write off of reserves and accounts receivable acquired in the trex medical acquisition related to the conventional general radiography product lines we eliminated 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
during fiscal we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance against a portion of our remaining potential deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to the net losses generated in fiscal and for which we can only realize through the generation of future taxable income and to certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions  for which realization is uncertain 
in fiscal we had a benefit for income taxes of  as a result of a million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a million tax provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our deferred tax asset to million that we believe will be fully realizable in the next to months 
we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings  however  we believe that us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes 
lease accounting in september  we completed a sale leaseback of our bedford  massachusetts and danbury  connecticut facilities  resulting in a loss of  which is included in interest other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
under the terms of the sale leaseback  we entered into a year operating lease agreement for the two facilities requiring annual rent payments of million 
in applying the provisions of sfas no  lease accounting  certain judgments and estimates must be made to determine if the agreement should be accounted for as a capital or operating lease 
most significant is the determination of our incremental borrowing rate in calculating the present value of minimum lease payments in the event the rate implicit in the lease is unknown 
in order for a lease agreement to be accounted as an operating lease  among other requirements  the present value of the minimum lease payments may not be greater than of the fair value of the leased asset 
in determining our incremental borrowing rate we considered  among other things  quotes obtained from several lenders assuming we were financing a purchase of the facility 
we used an incremental borrowing rate of which we believe to be conservative compared to the range of rates quoted by several lenders 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture and distribution of proprietary x ray  digital x ray and other medical imaging systems 
as a result of our decision to close the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility  we have reclassified the general radiography business from the mammography general radiography segment into a separate segment 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
our businesses are reported as five segments osteoporosis assessment  mammography  digital imaging  mini c arm imaging  and conventional general radiography 
our osteoporosis assessment products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems and  to a lesser extent  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product 
bone densitometry is the precise measurement of bone density to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases that can lead to debilitating bone fractures 
our mammography products include a broad product line of breast imaging products  including mammography systems and breast biopsy systems 
our digital imaging products include general radiographic systems and a digital component for original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own equipment 
our mini c arm products are low intensity  real time mini c arm x ray systems used primarily for minimally invasive surgery on a patient s extremities 
in january   we closed the manufacturing facility for the conventional general radiography products  however  we continue to service and support most of these product lines 
acquisitions  recent developments and restructuring and nonrecurring charges trex medical acquisition 
on september   we acquired the us business assets of trex medical in exchange for approximately million in cash and a note in the amount of million 
the cash portion of the purchase price was subject to adjustment based upon the working capital of trex medical as of the closing 
following the acquisition  we disagreed with trex medical s calculation of its working capital as reflected on its closing balance sheet 
in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the purchase agreement  we and thermo electron corporation  sole shareholder of trex medical  jointly sought the assistance of an independent arbitrator to determine the closing working capital 
in june  the independent arbitrator determined that adjustments of approximately million  in addition to  of adjustments agreed to by thermo electron corporation before submission to arbitration  were required to the closing balance sheet submitted by trex medical 
this resulted in a payment of approximately  to us as an adjustment to the cash portion of the purchase price 
in addition  in november  we finalized the plan to close the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility located in littleton  massachusetts that we had acquired as part of the trex medical acquisition 
in connection with the closure of the littleton facility  we eliminated approximately employment positions and incurred a restructuring charge  primarily related to severance costs  of approximately million  in fiscal also  as a result of the arbitration settlement  we evaluated the components of the million of adjustments and determined that approximately million of reserves and accruals provided for through charges to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal should be recorded in our allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition 
included in our results for the twelve month period ended september  are expense reductions totaling million related to the purchase price reallocation as follows 
million cost of product sales reduction for warranty accrual and for performance upgrades on prior sales  
 selling expense reduction for accrued sales commissions  and 
 general and administrative expense reduction for various expense accruals and bad debt expense 
fleet business credit  llc litigation settlement 
in august  we settled our dispute with fleet business credit  llc fleet relating to our strategic alliance program under which fleet  formerly sanwa business credit corp  acquired our bone densitometry systems to lease to physicians on a fee per scan basis throughout the united states 
under the settlement agreement  the parties dismissed their claims and entered mutual releases 
in addition  we paid fleet million in cash and executed a million unsecured note payable 
the note bears interest at fleet s prime rate plus with the full amount of principal to be paid on august  we further agreed to continue to assist fleet in remarketing returned systems  as requested by fleet  based on separately negotiated market rate terms on a prepaid basis 
we also continue to be entitled to benefit from excess lease and other payments made to fleet under the program  which will offset amounts due under the note payable 
under the terms of the original agreement with fleet s predecessor  sanwa  we were contingently liable for a certain amount per system sold under the agreement 
we recorded the amount for which we were contingently liable as deferred revenue 
based on the settlement  we reduced deferred revenue for the million cash payment and reflected million as a long term note payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we have also recognized as revenue the remaining deferred revenue amounts of million 
in addition  we reversed  of related warranty reserves  which were no longer necessary as a result of the settlement  through a reduction of cost of product sales  for a total positive impact on earnings relating to the fleet settlement of approximately million 
restructuring and nonrecurring charges 
in addition to the adjustments and charges described above  our results for the year ended september  include the following restructuring and nonrecurring charges 
on august  we announced a restructuring plan focusing primarily on a company wide cost savings initiative which includes a planned reduction of the workforce by  or approximately eighty employees  and otherwise trimming operating expenses in each of our business units 
as a result of the plan  once completed  we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately million 
we incurred a restructuring charge  primarily related to severance costs  of approximately million in fiscal 
we incurred approximately  of expenses related to the move of the fluoroscan mini c arm product line to the corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts including approximately  of moving costs   of severance costs   to vacate the facility and  of other costs 
for the year ended september  we incurred approximately million of severance costs related to the closing of the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility  closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and our continuing efforts to streamline operations 
public offering of common stock 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds from this offering of approximately million 
sale leaseback transaction 
in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the new lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities 
of the million in net proceeds we received from this transaction  we used million to immediately repay the trex medical million note payable plus accrued interest of million 
the effect of the sale leaseback transaction is to eliminate interest expense with respect to the trex medical note and the related depreciation expense on the buildings  but on a going forward basis will increase operating expenses as a result of the lease payments 
at september  we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the lease 
new accounting standards 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued no 
 accounting for shipping and handling costs  relating to the accounting for shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
in accordance with issue no 
 all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  represent revenues earned for the goods provided and should be classified as revenue in the statement of operations 
we have historically accounted for reimbursements received from shipping and handling costs as a reduction to cost of revenues in the statement of operations to offset the costs incurred 
we adopted issue no 
in financial reporting periods beginning after september  accordingly  comparative financial statements herein for prior periods have been reclassified to comply with the guidance in issue no 
during the years ended september   september  and september   the amounts billed to customers totaled   and   respectively  which have been reflected as product revenues and cost of revenues in accordance with issue no 
in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by items as shown in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales service and other revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales cost of service and other revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative nonrecurring and restructuring income loss from operations interest income interest other expense loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our mammography products  digital imaging products and to a lesser extent  mini c arm products 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues from our conventional general radiography business  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in the number of sahara ultrasound units sold primarily in the united states 
we completed the phase out of the unprofitable conventional general radiography product line during the third quarter of fiscal product sales 
product sales in our mammography business increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of mammography systems sold in the united states partially offset by fewer mammography systems sold internationally 
digital imaging product sales increased to million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital systems sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of digital plates sold 
mini c arm product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of premier systems sold in the united states 
osteoporosis assessment product sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of sahara ultrasound systems sold in the united states 
conventional general radiography product sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to our decision to phase out our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line during fiscal in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
service and other revenue 
service and other revenue decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in service and other revenue in fiscal was primarily the result of the million recognized in fiscal in connection with the settlement of the fleet litigation and from a reduction in sales of mammography product options in fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was revenue from the licensing of certain digital imaging software and mammography patented technology in fiscal costs of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal cost of product sales includes a million reduction of expenses related to the final purchase price adjustment of the trex medical acquisition 
excluding the effect of these reductions  costs of product sales as a percentage of product revenue would have been in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to improved gross margins recognized on the mammography and digital imaging products as a result of a significant increase in revenues and cost savings initiatives enacted in the summer of the increased volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at both facilities 
drc continues to have significant fixed manufacturing costs and is operating significantly below manufacturing capacity 
however  margins on these products were positive for the last three quarters of fiscal compared to negative margins for prior periods 
our gross margins also improved as a result of the decrease in sales of conventional general radiography products which have had significantly lower margins 
costs of service and other revenue 
cost of service and other revenue increased as a percentage of service and other revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal cost of service and other revenue includes a  reduction of expenses related to the fleet litigation settlement 
excluding the reduction of these expenses and the million of other revenue recognized from this settlement  fiscal cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue would have been 
these costs decreased as a percentage of service and other revenue due to our closure of the conventional general radiography facility which was partially offset by additional personnel and other costs in our field service area for our other business segments due to the increase in the number of systems in our installed base 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel primarily related to our cost saving initiatives enacted in the summer of in addition  approximately million and million of these expenses in fiscal and  respectively  related to the development of new digital mammography and general radiography systems detectors at drc 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to our reduction in personnel related to our cost saving initiatives enacted during the summer of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to our reduction in personnel and other cost savings initiatives enacted during the summer of and  to a lesser extent  the elimination of the legal expenses as a result of the settlement of the fleet litigation in august  in addition  in connection with our early adoption of sfas  see note of our consolidated financial statements we eliminated approximately  of goodwill amortization expense in the current year 
restructuring and nonrecurring charges 
restructuring costs in fiscal of approximately million were primarily the result of our continuing efforts to streamline operations and eliminate unprofitable product lines 
we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal primarily comprised of severance costs related to the termination of employees at the littleton facility 
in addition  we incurred severance cost of approximately  and  in connection with the closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and the continued reduction of lorad s workforce  respectively 
the severance charges related to the workforce reductions of persons in france and persons at lorad and were across all functional areas 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred additional severance costs of approximately  primarily comprised of severance costs in connection with the reduction of our workforce in the united states and europe by persons across all functional areas 
restructuring and nonrecurring costs of approximately million in fiscal were primarily the result of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations 
specifically in fiscal  as a result of a reduction in our workforce  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to severance related expenses 
also in fiscal  we moved our fluoroscan operations from a facility in northbrook  illinois to our corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
we incurred approximately  of nonrecurring expenses in connection with this move 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced interest rates on our investments 
interest other expense 
in fiscal and  we incurred interest and other expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
these expenses included interest costs of approximately  per quarter on the million note payable issued in connection with the trex medical acquisition  and to a lesser extent  interest costs related to our lending arrangement with foothill capital corporation  foreign currency transaction gains and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure on those transactions 
in september  we paid off the million note payable to trex medical from the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction of our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and also our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
therefore  future periods will only include interest costs associated with the remaining lending agreements 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in fiscal we had a benefit for income taxes of  as a result of a million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a million tax provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our deferred tax asset to million that we believe will be fully realizable in the next to months 
during fiscal  as a result of the economic stimulus bill signed into law in march  we have filed or are in the process of filing  carryback claims of approximately million 
of this amount  we have received million in cash  and million which we expect to receive in fiscal is included in other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet at september  in fiscal  we recorded a tax provision for minimum state taxes as we believed that it was prudent at the time not to benefit net operating losses that would only be realized by generating sufficient future taxable income 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of revenues of million from sales of mammography and conventional general radiography products acquired in connection with the trex medical acquisition in september product sales 
total product sales for our historic businesses  osteoporosis assessment  mini c arm imaging and digital imaging  increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital imaging products sold  which was partially offset by a decrease in osteoporosis assessment sales 
total digital imaging sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital imaging systems sold  primarily in the united states 
the decrease in osteoporosis assessment sales was primarily due to a decrease in sahara ultrasound product unit sales in the united states which were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our sales of dual energy x ray bone densitometers  principally our newly introduced delphi product line 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
service and other revenue 
service and other revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of service revenues of million in connection with the trex medical acquisition in september the remaining increase was due to increased service contract revenue in the osteoporosis assessment business and increased spare part sales in the digital imaging business 
in fiscal and  other revenue consisted primarily of royalty revenues from our licensing of technology to vivid technologies  inc vivid for explosives detection screening  and additional revenues generated from our strategic alliance program on a fee per scan basis 
in fiscal  other revenue also included million of revenue attributable to our settlement of the fleet litigation 
in fiscal  other revenue included the million of royalty revenue we recognized relating to the buy out by vivid of our baggage equipment license 
these revenues for both periods were included in our osteoporosis assessment segment revenues 
in november  we announced that we were closing our conventional general radiography equipment manufacturing facility and relocating some product lines and our sales and support personnel to our corporate headquarters 
approximately million of revenues in fiscal and million of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this operation 
these revenues included service revenues of approximately million during the year and million in the fourth quarter 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales increased slightly as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  these costs were reduced by million related to the final purchase price adjustment of the trex medical acquisition 
excluding the effects of this reduction  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue would have been in fiscal included in the cost of product sales for lorad and the trex medical general radiography products in fiscal was approximately million of acquisition related charges 
excluding the effects of these charges  our costs of product sales as a percentage of product sales would have been in fiscal in fiscal  improvements in margins in the osteoporosis assessment and digital imaging businesses were offset by our increased sales of lower margin mammography and conventional general radiography products acquired from trex medical and of digital radiography products 
margins from our digital imaging products improved in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased volume 
however  margins on these products continued to be negative reflecting the under absorption of our manufacturing overhead  as a result of our limited sales of those products  and inefficiencies relating to new product introduction 
our cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales for our osteoporosis assessment  mini c arm and digital imaging businesses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased manufacturing and service costs related to digital imaging  which has significant fixed manufacturing costs and is operating significantly below manufacturing capacity 
cost of service and other revenue 
cost of service and other revenue decreased as a percentage of service and other revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal cost of service and other revenue includes a  reduction related to the fleet litigation settlement 
absent the reduction of these expenses and the million of other revenue recognized from this settlement  fiscal cost of service and other revenue would have been 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the increase  in absolute dollars  was primarily due to the acquisition of trex medical which added approximately million of research and development expenses in fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in research and development spending primarily related to our bone densitometry products  following our introduction of the delphi product line 
in fiscal  approximately million of our research and development expenses related to our development of new digital radiography systems and detectors  compared to approximately million of such expenses in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  our research and development expense included a million charge related to purchased in process research and development acquired in connection with the acquisition of the assets of trex medical 
as part of the purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that are a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that technology assets  certain tradename and assembled workforce had value 
as a result of this identification and valuation process  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million  of total sales  in fiscal from million  of total sales  in fiscal the increase  in absolute dollars  was primarily due to incremental selling and marketing expenses of million related to the mammography and general radiography products acquired from trex medical in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in sales commissions in our other businesses 
the reduced sales commissions were primarily attributable to the lower sales volume in the primary care market in the united states  where we generally have higher commission expenses 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses were also decreased by approximately  as a result of the trex medical purchase price settlement  as compared to fiscal which included approximately  of acquisition related charges 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the increase  in absolute dollars  was primarily due to the addition of approximately million of general and administrative expenses related to the acquired trex medical businesses in the current year 
fiscal results included approximately million of general and administrative expenses relating to the acquired trex medical businesses 
in fiscal  we had a reduction of approximately  to our general and administrative expenses relating to the trex medical acquisition to reflect the arbitrated purchase price adjustment 
our increases in general administrative expenses associated with the trex medical acquisition were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses in our historic businesses  primarily due to a reduction in payroll and payroll related expenses and bad debt expense compared to fiscal restructuring and nonrecurring charges 
restructuring and nonrecurring costs in fiscal were primarily the result of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations 
in fiscal  as a result of a reduction in our workforce  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to severance related expenses 
in the third quarter of fiscal we moved our fluoroscan operations from a facility in northbrook  illinois to our corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
we incurred approximately  of expenses in connection with this move 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due to a lower investment base than in the prior year  primarily due to the use of cash for the trex medical acquisition during fiscal and our continuing investment in research and development of our digital radiography products 
interest other expense 
we incurred other expense of approximately million in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  these expenses were primarily due to interest costs of approximately million per year on the million note payable issued in connection with the trex medical acquisition 
in the first quarter of fiscal  these costs were partially offset by insurance proceeds received in excess of cost related to storm damage at fluoroscan last year 
in fiscal  these expenses primarily included foreign currency transaction losses and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure on those transactions 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in fiscal  we had a benefit for income taxes as a result of the loss during the period 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was impacted by our establishing a valuation allowance for the tax benefit associated with our losses arising during that year 
segment results of operations as a result of our decision to close the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility  we have reclassified the general radiography business from the mammography general radiography segment into a separate segment 
prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
our businesses are reported as five segments osteoporosis assessment  mammography  digital imaging  mini c arm imaging  and general radiography 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from each of these segments are described above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
osteoporosis assessment 
reported operating income for the osteoporosis assessment business segment was million for fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal fiscal operating income includes million of additional revenues and  of decreased expenses as a result of the fleet litigation settlement 
absent the effect of this settlement  the improvement in operating income for this business segment for fiscal was primarily due to an overall reduction in operating expenses as a result of our cost savings initiatives partially offset by an increase in field service and training related expenses including additional headcount 
mammography 
reported operating income for the mammography segment in fiscal improved to million from  in fiscal the fiscal results for the mammography business segment included expense reductions of approximately million related to the final purchase price adjustment for the trex acquisition 
the significant improvements in operating income in the current year excluding these expense reductions in fiscal were primarily due to increased revenues and improved gross margin 
the increased gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and a reduction in manufacturing cost and operating expenses as a result of our cost saving initiatives enacted during the summer of and  to a lesser extent  to a non recurring charge of  in the first quarter of fiscal to product cost of sales for the fair market write up of acquired inventory 
digital imaging 
the digital imaging business segment reported a decrease in loss from operations to million in fiscal from million for fiscal these decreases were primarily due to increased revenues  improved gross margin and  to a lesser extent  reduced research and development spending related to the completion of the epex and radex direct to digital general radiography systems and a reduction in other operating expenses as a result of our cost saving initiatives enacted in the summer of mini c arm imaging 
the mini c arm business segment reported operating income of million for fiscal compared to operating income of  for fiscal these improvements were primarily attributable to increased revenues  improved gross margin plus an overall reduction in manufacturing costs and operating expenses in connection with the assimilation of the fluoroscan product line into the corporate headquarters located in bedford  massachusetts 
general radiography 
as previously discussed  we have closed the manufacturing facility of the conventional general radiography business and relocated certain of its product lines and sales and service support personnel to our corporate headquarters 
this business segment reported an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal the decrease in operating losses are primarily due to the elimination of costs in the current year related to the facility closure 
we incurred losses from our conventional general radiography business through the first half of fiscal however  the continuing service business generated operating profits of approximately million during the last half of fiscal acquired in process technology as part of the trex medical purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that technology assets and assembled workforce had value 
at the acquisition date  trex medical was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several research and development projects related to its mammography and general radiography lines of business 
as part of our exit strategy for the conventional general radiography business  we have terminated the development projects and efforts for the general radiography line of business 
we will not incur any further expenditures or recognize any revenue related to these projects 
since the acquisition  we have used the acquired in process technology to develop new products  which have or are expected to become part of our product lines when completed 
however  we are constantly reviewing the allocation of our research and development resources to respond to the ever changing market and technology developments  as well as developments of our own internally developed and acquired evolving technology portfolio 
also  we have combined acquired research and development projects with other of our development activities  and we have delayed two projects 
as of september  our expenditures incurred and estimates to complete our acquired in process projects related to the mammography business were consistent with our initial expectations other than the delays mentioned above 
if we are not successful in implementing our projects  we may be unable to realize the remaining value assigned to this in process technology 
in addition  the remaining value of the other acquired intangible assets associated with this technology may also become impaired 
liquidity and capital resources at september  we had approximately million of working capital 
at that date our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased approximately during fiscal primarily due to the proceeds from our sale leaseback transaction for our bedford  massachusetts and danbury  connecticut facilities in september  the net proceeds from our common stock public offering in december  and from operating activities  partially offset by the use of cash for the repayment of the trex medical note payable and for purchases of property and equipment 
our cash provided by operating activities was million which included net income of  for fiscal increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and a million charge to increase our deferred tax valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of these amounts were partially offset by changes in our current assets and liabilities net of income tax refunds of approximately million which we expect to receive in fiscal  due to the effect of the economic stimulus bill and the reclass of million in deferred tax asset which is expected to be realized within the next fiscal year 
cash used in operations due to changes in our current assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease of million in accounts receivable  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and a decrease of million in inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to improved collections and the decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and prepaid expenses were primarily due to the timing of payments 
in fiscal  we provided approximately million of cash from investing activities 
these cash flows were primarily attributable to the net proceeds from our sale leaseback transaction of million partially reduced by purchases of property and equipment of million  which consisted primarily of corporate wide computer information software and hardware  systems and other equipment and building improvements 
in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million of cash 
these cash flows included approximately million  net of offering expenses  from the public sale of million shares of our common stock and proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to options and employee stock purchase plan of million  partially offset by the repayment of the million trex medical note payable plus interest and million of repayments of our european line of credit and our term loan with foothill capital corp 
as of september  we had short term borrowings  including the current portion of our long term obligations  of  and long term notes payable totaling million 
the short term borrowings represent the current portion of our long term notes payable 
the long term notes payable consisted of the million borrowed from foothill capital corporation as the long term portion of our term loan under our credit facility  and the  balance due on the note to fleet in connection with the settlement of the fleet litigation 
we maintain an unsecured line of credit with a european bank for the equivalent of million  which bears interest at the europe interbank offered rate at september  plus 
the borrowings under this line are primarily used by our european subsidiaries to settle intercompany sales and are denominated in the respective local currencies of its european subsidiaries 
the line of credit may be canceled by the bank with days notice 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line 
in september we obtained a secured loan from foothill capital corporation 
the loan agreement with foothill capital corporation provides for a term loan of approximately million  which we borrowed at signing  and a revolving line of credit facility 
the maximum amount we can borrow under the loan agreement is million with an option for us to increase this amount to million during the term of the agreement  if certain conditions are met 
the loan agreement contains financial and other covenants and the actual amount which we can borrow under the line of credit at any time is based upon a formula tied to the amount of our qualifying accounts receivable and inventory 
in december we amended this loan agreement primarily to change financial covenants to reflect restructuring charges we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the additional charges we expected to incur in connection with our decision to close our littleton facility 
also  as a result of this amendment  our loan may be limited based upon some financial covenants and formulas 
the term loan accrues interest at prime plus for five years 
the line of credit advances accrue interest at prime plus 
the line of credit expires in september we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  in april  we began an implementation project for an integrated enterprise wide software application 
through september  we have made payments totaling million for hardware  software and consulting services 
we expect to make additional payments of approximately million in fiscal in connection with this implementation 
most of the cost is currently being capitalized and upon completion will be amortized over its expected useful life 
in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the new lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
the aggregate total minimum lease payments during the initial year term are million 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities 
under the lease  we make customary representations and warranties and agree to certain financial covenants and indemnities 
in the event we default on the lease  the landlord may terminate the lease  accelerate payments and collect liquidated damages 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      except as set forth above  we do not have any other significant capital commitments 
we are working on several projects  with an emphasis on direct radiography plates and systems 
we believe that we have sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and certain accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under this statement it is required that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  issued in july  addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit costs as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
fasb interpretation no 
guarantor accounting fasb interpretation no 
will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
most guarantees are to be recognized and initially measured at fair value  which is a change from current practice 
in addition  guarantors will be required to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of the guarantor making payments under the guarantee is remote 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables at the november  meeting  the task force reached a consensus on issue  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
following is a brief summary of the final model approved by the task force 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria 
the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis 
that item s has value on a standalone basis if it is sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
in the context of a customer s ability to resell the deliverable  the task force observed that this criterion does not require the existence of an observable market 

there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s 

if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 

arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the amount allocated to the delivered item s is limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 

applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
we are currently evaluating the ultimate impact of this statement on our results of operations or financial position 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
we continue to incur significant losses in our digital imaging business segment and cannot assure that the segment will become profitable 
our digital imaging business segment incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal these losses were a large contributor in our incurring significant overall net losses in fiscal and  and offset the aggregate net income we recognized on our other business segments in fiscal we intend to incur significant expenses in connection with the further development  manufacturing ramp up and commercialization of our direct radiography plates and systems 
we cannot assure that the operating results of our digital imaging segment will improve 
the markets for our direct radiography products are in the early stage of development 
in  our subsidiary  direct radiography corp  was the first company to introduce direct to digital x ray imaging products in the united states 
the markets for these products are relatively new 
there is a significant installed base of conventional x ray imaging products in hospitals and radiological practices 
the use of our direct to digital x ray imaging products in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x ray imaging equipment 
moreover  we believe that a major factor in the market s acceptance of direct to digital x ray technology is the trend toward transition by the healthcare industry from conventional film archiving systems to hospital picture  archive and communication systems  known as pacs  to store x ray images electronically 
because the benefits of our direct to digital technology may not be fully realized by customers until they install a pacs platform  a large potential market for these products may not develop until pacs environments are more widely used 
because of the early stage of the markets for these products  it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
we cannot assure that any significant market will develop for our direct radiography products 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require  we will not be successful in developing and marketing those products 
the manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in commercial quantities  primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards 
our initial difficulties have led to increased delivery lead times and increased costs of manufacturing these products 
our failure  including the failure of our contract manufacturers  to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns  product recalls or withdrawals  or other problems that could harm our business and prospects 
our success depends on new product development 
we have a continuing research and development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products 
we are expending significant resources on the development of digital x ray imaging products  including a digital mammography product 
the successful development of our products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including 
unanticipated delays  
access to capital  
budget overruns  
technical problems  and 
other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for our products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications 
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products 
newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects 
in addition  these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications 
if  despite our internal testing and testing by our customers  any of our products contains errors or defects or any of our products fails to meet customer specifications  then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies 
we may not be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  and may only be able to do so at considerable expense 
in addition  any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction  negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects 
the general radiography digital market is a new market which is continuing to develop and our new products for this market may not meet the needs of this market as it continues to develop 
the general radiography digital market is a new market which is continuing to develop and for which customer requirements have not been fully specified 
for example  our initial specification for the first two digital products for general radiography  the epex and radex  did not fulfill all the needs of some potential customers for these systems 
we addressed these additional customer requirements through the development and release of new software for these systems 
our introduction of our epex and radex systems has also resulted in challenges to our direct sales force  which had only limited experience in marketing general radiography products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to develop a successful strategy for addressing the general radiography market as it continues to develop 
our failure to do so could harm our business and prospects 
our reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products could harm our business and prospects 
we rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products 
in particular we have only one source of supply for each of the panel and the coating of that panel for our direct radiography products 
the supplier for the panel coating is analogic corporation  which is also a customer as well as a potential competitor 
we are seeking to qualify a second supplier for the panel coating to increase our manufacturing capacity and flexibility  but cannot assure that we will be successful 
in addition we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini c arm systems 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects 
any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments  which could result in lost or deferred sales 
we have recently expanded our direct sales and service efforts for mammography into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states  and cannot assure that we can effect any such transition effectively 
we have sold and serviced a majority of our mammography systems in the united states primarily through a network of independent distributors and to a lesser extent  through our direct sales force 
we have recently expanded our direct sales and service efforts for mammography into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  and are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states 
the transition to a direct sales and service force could adversely affect our relationships with our end user customers and our sales of mammography systems if we do not manage the transition effectively 
our reliance on a customer for a significant portion of our revenues could harm our business and prospects 
our largest independent distributor  diagnostic imaging  inc  recently acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of platinum equity  llc from pss world medical  inc  owed us a total of approximately million as of september  and accounted for approximately of our product sales for fiscal we do not have a long term agreement with diagnostic imaging obligating them to purchase products from us  or restricting them from purchasing products from our competitors 
a reduction or delay in orders from diagnostic imaging  or a delay or default in the payment of their accounts receivable  including in connection with the expansion of our direct sale and service force  could harm our business and prospects 
if we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants under our loan agreement and our long term leases for our headquarters and lorad facilities  our loan availability may be limited or the rent due under those leases may be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our loan agreement with foothill capital corporation and our long term leases contain financial and other covenants 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our loan agreement  our availability under our loan agreement could be reduced or our lender could declare a default 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our long term leases  the remaining rent payable under those leases could be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our failure to meet any of our covenants under our loan agreement or long term leases could significantly harm our liquidity and financial position 
we may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
many of these competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to hospitals  radiology clients  general purchasing organizations and other potential customers 
in addition  many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and offer a range of products broader than our products 
some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects 
the primary competitor for our bone densitometry products is general electric medical systems ge 
our direct to digital imaging products compete with traditional x ray systems as well as computed radiography systems  which are less expensive than our products  and other direct to digital systems 
the larger competitors in these markets include ge  siemens  kodak  canon and varian 
general electric has received fda approval to market a digital general radiography x ray system 
another company  fischer imaging  recently received fda marketing approval for its general radiography digital x ray system 
our mammography systems compete with products offered by ge  siemens  instrumentarium and fischer imaging 
our minimally invasive breast biopsy systems compete with products offered by fischer imaging and with conventional surgical biopsy procedures 
our mini c arm products compete directly with mini c arms manufactured and sold by a limited number of companies including ge 
we also compete indirectly with manufacturers of conventional c arm image intensifiers including siemens and ge 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for our products has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements 
we believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance our existing products  successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance 
if we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology 
our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects 
in fiscal we entered into strategic alliances with siemens and r technologies and entered into a letter of intent to form a strategic alliance with agfa 
we are also exploring other potential alliances  joint ventures or other business relationships 
siemens and agfa are competitors or potential competitors to us in some of our business segments  as well as a competitors or potential competitors to some of our customers or potential customers 
our alliance with siemens  agfa or any other person could enhance their business to our detriment or make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others 
moreover  we may not be able to 
identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures  
assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated  
successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us  or 
successfully manage any alliance or joint venture 
furthermore  any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
our entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture or failure to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively could harm our business and prospects 
the uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the united states and in many foreign countries could 
limit the use of our products  
reduce reimbursement available for such use  or 
adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted 
these reforms or cost containment measures  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could harm our business and prospects and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on advantageous terms  if at all 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers 
the costs of our products are substantial  and market acceptance of our products depends upon our customers ability to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for use of our products 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid patients 
under current cms guidelines  varying reimbursement levels have been established for dual energy x ray and ultrasound bone density assessment  mammography and other imaging and diagnostic procedures performed by our products 
the actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state medicare carriers and  for non medicare and medicaid patients  private insurance carriers 
there are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by cms and by a state medicare carrier and private insurance carriers 
moreover  states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the cms reimbursement guidelines 
the use of our products outside the united states is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory and insurance carriers 
a reduction or other adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
the future growth of our bone densitometry business depends in large part on the continued development and more widespread acceptance of complementary therapies 
our bone densitometers and related products are used to assist physicians in diagnosing patients at risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders  and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies to treat these disorders 
as a result  the future growth of the market for these products and of this business will in large part be dependent upon the development and more widespread acceptance of drug therapies to prevent and to treat osteoporosis 
over the last several years  the fda has approved a number of drug therapies to treat osteoporosis 
we also understand that a number of other drug therapies are under development 
while sales of our bone densitometry products have benefited from the increased availability and use of these therapies  most patients who are at risk for osteoporosis continue to go untreated 
we cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective  obtain regulatory approval  or that any approved therapy will gain wide acceptance 
even if these therapies gain widespread acceptance  we cannot assure that this acceptance will increase the sales of our products 
reductions in revenues could harm our operating results because a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
we likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues 
as a result  shortfalls in revenues are likely to harm our operating results 
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation 
the results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors  including 
the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts  
the development status and demand for drug therapies to treat osteoporosis  
the development status and demand for our direct to digital imaging products  
economic conditions in our markets  
foreign exchange rates  
the timing of orders  
the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  
the mix of products sold by us  
the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  and 
pricing and other competitive conditions 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties could also delay shipments 
any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices  particularly those that employ x ray technology 
our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of european currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business  in relation to the us dollar  have harmed and could continue to harm our business and prospects 
foreign sales accounted for approximately of our product sales in fiscal and of our product sales in fiscal and of product sales in fiscal we maintain a sales and service office in belgium and a support office in france 
the expenses and sales of these offices are denominated in local currencies 
we anticipate that foreign sales and sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
fluctuations in the value of local currencies have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  amounts translated into us dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods 
in particular  the continued strength in value of the us dollar to the has resulted in an increase in price for products denominated in those currencies 
we believe that these price increases have harmed our ability to compete in these markets 
we have hedged our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local european currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices 
there is a risk that these hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure 
we conduct our business worldwide  which exposes us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
we sell our products to customers throughout the world 
our worldwide business may be harmed by 
difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations  
greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  
possible adverse tax consequences  
governmental currency controls  
changes in various regulatory requirements  
political and economic changes and disruptions  
export import controls  and 
tariff regulations 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications 
there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our technology 
moreover  there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products  processes or technology 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may harm our business and prospects 
our future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel  particularly our key research and development personnel  could harm our business and prospects 
our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly software engineers and other technical personnel  is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel 
we are implementing a new corporate wide management information system  which if not successful could adversely impact our ability to operate virtually all aspects of our business 
we are implementing a new corporate wide management information system 
if we fail to implement this system effectively  our ability to operate virtually all aspects of our business could be adversely harmed  including our ability to purchase and schedule inventory  pay vendors  ship products  bill customers and collect receivables 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product liability or other claims  or that in the future liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business 
we maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims  or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
an underinsured or uninsured claim could harm our operating results or financial condition 
we use hazardous materials and products 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of this type of accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could be extensive 
we are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety  environmental protection  hazardous substance control  and waste management and disposal 
the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to  among other things  fines and criminal liability 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and the provisions of delaware corporate law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
in addition  we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including 
announcements and rumors of developments related to our business  or the industry in which we compete  
quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  
general conditions in the worldwide economy  
announcements of technological innovations  
new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  
developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and 
developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high tech companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and the market price of our common stock may decline
