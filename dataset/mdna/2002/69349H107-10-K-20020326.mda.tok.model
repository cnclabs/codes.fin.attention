item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other issues facing the company western united states wholesale power market 
power sales a significant portion of the company s earnings is derived from its off system sales 
the company has been very successful in developing its wholesale power trading activities in the western united states 
management believes this success is due to its niche business strategy of providing electric power customized to meet the special needs of customers 
this niche marketing strategy is based on the company s asset backed trading methodology whereby the company s net open position is always supported by its generation capacity excluded from its jurisdictional rates  or by its jurisdictional excess capacity 
this asset backed trading methodology helps to mitigate the risks inherent in the company s trading activities 
the company also utilizes long term transactions to enhance its product offering 
certain of the company s generation assets are excluded from jurisdictional electric rates 
in  the nmpuc excluded mw of sjgs unit and all of pvngs unit as a result  the company developed a bulk power marketing and trading operation to sell the generation from its excluded assets that no longer generated a return in rate base 
these activities include the forward purchase and sale of electricity to take advantage of market price opportunities in the electric wholesale market 
the company s wholesale power marketing area continues to increase the scope of its trading activities 
during  and  the company s sales in the off system markets accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of its total kwh sales 
of the total off system sales made in and  and respectively were transacted through purchases for resale 
in  the nmpuc established an off system sales methodology that provided for a sharing mechanism whereby a certain amount of revenues from off system sales were credited to reduce retail cost of service 
subsequent rate cases continued to utilize this methodology 
as a result  electric customers have received over million in rate benefits since from the company s wholesale power marketing activities 
as of december   the assets included in the electric customer rate base no longer had any excess capacity for purposes of certain portions of the sharing mechanism 
the last rate case froze rates until january  a significant portion of the company s growth strategy is based on growth in off system sales 
the company s business plan calls for the expansion of its wholesale power trading operation and the acquisition or development of additional generating capacity to support this growth under the company s asset backed trading methodology 
the company has committed to purchase five combustion turbines at a total cost of million 
the plants estimated cost of construction is approximately million of which the company has expended million as of december  in november  the company broke ground for afton  a mw gas fired generating plant on a site in southern new mexico 
this facility is expected to be operational by october currently  the company plans to expand the facility to mw by the end of in february  the company also broke ground to build lordsburg  an mw natural gas fired generating plant in southwestern new mexico 
this facility is expected to be operational by july the planned plants are part of the company s ongoing competitive strategy of increasing generation capacity over time 
the company has entered into various firm off system sales contracts 
these contracts contain fixed capacity charges in addition to energy charges 
the sdg e contract  which required sdg e to purchase mw from the company expired on april  the appa contract requires appa to purchase varying amounts of power from the company through may and allows appa to make adjustments to the purchase amounts subject to certain notice provisions 
for  appa invoked its option to increase its peak demand to mw 
the appa demand will drop to mw in june the company furnished firm requirements wholesale power in new mexico in to the city of gallup 
the company is committed to provide service to the city of gallup through april average monthly demands under the city of gallup contract for were approximately mw 
beginning july  the company began serving navopache electric cooperative firm requirements service under the provisions of a year contract 
average monthly demand for navopache is mw 
the company began serving a partial requirements contract with the texas new mexico power company in july for mw 
the contract service drops to mw for  then becomes a full requirements contract in january and continues through the full requirements demand is expected to be mw in  mw in  mw in and mw in no firm requirements wholesale customer accounted for more than of the company s total electric sales for resale revenues for the year ended december  sources of power as of december   the total net generation capacity of facilities owned or leased by the company was  mw  excluding the ppa discussed below which would bring the total to  mw 
the company is committed to increasing its utilization of its major generation capacity at sjgs  four corners and pvngs 
sjgs is operated by the company 
in  the plant s capacity factor performance ranked in the th percentile of the coal fired power plants in the nation 
sjgs s equivalent availability and capacity factor were and respectively  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to and  respectively for capacity factors for four corners and pvngs were and  respectively  in  as compared to and  respectively  in four corners and pvngs are operated by aps 
see item properties 
in addition to generation capacity  the company purchases power in the market 
the company has a power purchase contract with sps which originally provided for the purchase of up to mw per year and expires in may the company may reduce its purchases from sps by mw annually upon three years notice 
the company provided notice to reduce the purchase by mw in and by an additional mw in the company also is party to a master power purchase and sale agreement with sps  dated august  pursuant to which the company has agreed to purchase mw of firm power from sps from through in addition  the company has mw of contingent capacity obtained from el paso under a transmission capacity for generation capacity trade arrangement through september beginning october and continuing through june  the capacity amount is mw 
the company holds a ppa with tri state for mw through june  in addition  the company is interconnected with various utilities for economy interchanges and mutual assistance in emergencies 
in  the company entered into a long term ppa for the rights to all the output of the new delta gas fired generating plant for years 
the plant has received ferc approval for exempt wholesale generator status with respect to the gas turbine generating unit 
the ppa s maximum dependable capacity is mw 
in july  the plant went into operation 
the gas turbine generating unit is operated by delta and is located on the company s retired person generating station site in the coa 
the site for the generating unit was chosen  in part  to provide needed benefits to the company s constrained transmission system 
primary fuel for the gas turbine generating unit is natural gas  which is provided by the company 
in addition  the unit has the capability to utilize low sulfur fuel oil in the event natural gas is not available or cost effective 
for accounting purposes  the ppa is treated as an operating lease 
fuel and water supply the percentages of the company s generation of electricity on the basis of kwh fueled by coal  nuclear fuel and gas and oil  and the average costs to the company of those fuels in cents per million btu  during the past three years were as follows coal nuclear gas and oil percent of average percent of average percent of average the estimated generation mix for is coal  nuclear and gas and oil 
due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies  the utilization of locally available coal deposits and the generally abundant supply of nuclear fuel  the company believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future 
coal the coal requirements for the sjgs are being supplied by sjcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of bhp  who holds certain federal  state and private coal leases under a coal sales agreement pursuant to which sjcc will supply processed coal for operation of the sjgs until bhp minerals international  inc has guaranteed the obligations of sjcc under the agreement  which contemplates the delivery of approximately million tons of coal during its remaining term 
that amount would supply substantially all the requirements of the sjgs through approximately in august  the company signed an agreement with sjcc and tucson to replace two surface mining operations with a single underground mine located adjacent to the plant 
underground mining is expected to provide a higher quality coal at a lower cost per ton 
the new mine will use the longwall mining technique and is expected to ramp to full station supply by the end of the revised coal contract  entered into as a result of the move to an underground mine  is expected to save the company between million and million in fuel costs over the next years 
besides saving on fuel costs  the cleaner burning  less abrasive coal is expected to reduce the company s share of the plant s maintenance and operating expenses 
the plant is expected to realize some of the benefits of the higher quality coal in  as the existing surface mines are phased out and the underground mine is developed 
four corners is supplied with coal under a fuel agreement between the owners and bncc  under which bncc agreed to supply all the coal requirements for the life of the plant 
the current fuel agreement expires december  negotiations for an extension have been initiated 
bncc holds a long term coal mining lease  with options for renewal  from the navajo nation and operates a surface mine adjacent to four corners with the coal supply expected to be sufficient to supply the units for their estimated useful lives 
natural gas the natural gas used as fuel for the company s coa electric generating plant reeves station and the ppa is delivered by gas 
see gas services 
in the second quarter of  the company s generation and trading operations began procuring its gas supply independent of the company and contracting with the utility operations for transportation services only 
the company s generation and trading operations commenced a hedging program to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in prices for natural gas as a fuel source for its generation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nuclear fuel the fuel cycle for pvngs is comprised of the following stages o the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  o the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  o the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  o the fabrication of fuel assemblies  o the utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and o the storage and disposal of spent fuel 
the pvngs participants have made contractual arrangements to obtain quantities of uranium concentrates anticipated to be sufficient to meet operational requirements through existing uranium concentrates contracts and options could be utilized to meet approximately of requirements in spot purchases on the uranium concentrates market will be made  as appropriate 
through the enriched uranium product eup contract  and through conversion services contracts  the pvngs participants have arranged for uranium conversion services that will meet of requirements in and the pvngs participants have an enrichment services contract and an eup contract that furnish enrichment services required for the operation of the three pvngs units through the pvngs participants have a new eup contract that will furnish up to of pvngs s requirements for uranium  conversion services and enrichment services from through this contract could also provide of enrichment services in and in addition  existing contracts will provide of fuel assembly fabrication services until at least for each pvngs unit 
water supply water for sjgs and four corners is obtained from the san juan river 
see item legal proceedings san juan river adjudication 
the company and tucson have a contract with the usbr usbr contract for consumption of  acre feet of water per year for the sjgs 
the contract expires in in addition  the company was granted the authority to consume  acre feet of water per year under a state permit that is held by bncc 
the company is of the opinion that sufficient water is under contract for the sjgs through bncc holds rights to san juan river water and committed a portion of those rights to four corners through the life of the plant 
in  the company signed a twenty two year contract with jicarilla  beginning in  for the full  acre feet of water from the jicarilla supply in navajo reservoir jicarilla contract 
the jicarilla contract is essentially equivalent to a renewed usbr contract  the only material difference being that jicarilla as opposed to usbr would be the contract supplier 
jicarilla has contract water in navajo reservoir pursuant to a water rights settlement approved by congress in and a judicial decree that was entered february  the contract has received all requisite approvals 
additionally  the company has entered into an agreement with the navajo nation to settle claims the tribe may assert in connection with any environmental approvals that may be required for a jicarilla contract 
this settlement with the navajo nation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
sewage effluent used for cooling purposes in the operation of the pvngs units is obtained under contracts with certain municipalities in the area 
the contracted quantity of effluent exceeds the amount required for the three pvngs units 
the validity of these effluent contracts is the subject of litigation in state court 
see item legal proceedings pvngs water supply litigation 
unregulated operations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  avistar  was formed in august as a new mexico corporation and is currently engaged in certain unregulated  non utility business ventures 
in july  the board of directors of avistar decided to wind down all operations except for avistar s reliadigm business unit  which provides maintenance solutions to the electric power industry 
avistar had previously divested itself of its energy partners business unit and liquidated axon field services and pathways integration 
in addition  the transfer of operation to the sangre de cristo water company to the city of santa fe was completed in the third quarter of all remaining non reliadigm investments were written off with the exception of avistar s investment in nth power  an energy related venture capital fund 
the company recorded charges of million to reflect these activities and the impairment of its avistar investments 
rates and regulation pnm is subject to the jurisdiction of the prc  the successor of the nmpuc effective january   with respect to its retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities  construction of major new generation and transmission facilities and other matters regarding retail utility services provided in new mexico 
the ferc has jurisdiction over rates and other matters related to wholesale electric sales and cost recovery of its transmission network 
in april  new mexico s electric utility industry restructuring act of the restructuring act was enacted into law 
the restructuring act opens the state s electric power market to customer choice 
in march  amendments to the restructuring act were passed which delay the original implementation dates by approximately five years  including the requirement for corporate separation of supply service and energy related service assets from distribution and transmission service assets 
in addition  the prc will have the authority to delay implementation for another year under certain circumstances 
the restructuring act  as amended  will give schools  residential and small business customers the opportunity to choose among competing power suppliers beginning in january competition would be expanded to include all customers starting in july the company is unable to predict the form its further restructuring will take under the delayed implementation of customer choice 
in addition  the restructuring act  as amended  recognizes that electric utilities should be permitted a reasonable opportunity to recover an appropriate amount of the costs previously incurred in providing electric service to their customers stranded costs 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other issues facing the company recovery of certain costs under the restructuring act below 
the amendments to the restructuring act required that the prc approve a holding company  subject to terms and conditions in the public interest  without corporate separation of supply service and energy related service assets from distribution and transmission service assets  by july  in addition  the amendments allow utilities to engage in unregulated power generation business activities until corporate separation is implemented see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other issues facing the company merchant plant filing 
on december   the company implemented the holding company structure without corporate separation of supply service and energy related services assets from distribution and transmission services assets 
this structure provides for a holding company whose current holdings will be public service company of new mexico  avistar and other inactive unregulated subsidiaries 
this was effected through the share exchange between existing company shareholders and the holding company  pnm resources 
avistar and most of the inactive unregulated subsidiaries became wholly owned subsidiaries of the holding company in january there are no current plans to provide the holding company with significant debt financing 
because of its ownership of pnm  the company is a public utility holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca 
however  the company is exempt from the provisions of puhca  except section a thereof  which requires the approval of the sec for a direct or indirect acquisition by a public utility holding company of five percent or more of the voting securities of any electric or gas utility company subject to puhca 
electric rates and regulation proceeding related to the restructuring act in november  the company began settlement negotiations with the prc s utility staff and intervenors in prc proceedings related to the restructuring act in order to resolve a number of matters 
those matters include issues being examined in the company s merchant plant filing at the prc  the future framework for restructuring the electric industry in new mexico under the restructuring act  and a future retail electric rate path 
the negotiations include the potential implementation and effective date of rates that would replace those approved under the rate freeze stipulation that remains in effect until january  ferc mandated regional transmission organizations with the passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of and the energy policy act  there has been a significant increase in the level of competition in the market for the generation and sale of electricity 
barriers have been reduced for companies wishing to build  own and operate electric generating facilities 
in  the ferc issued order which required electric utilities controlling transmission facilities to file open access transmission tariffs  which opened the utility transmission systems to wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy on a non discriminatory basis 
order also encouraged utilities to investigate the formation of independent system operators isos to operate transmission assets and provided guidance for the formation  operation and governance of isos 
in  the ferc issued order on regional transmission organizations rtos  which established timelines for transmission owning entities to join an rto and defined the minimum characteristics and functions of an rto 
the company  along with other regional transmission owners to s  originally pursued the formation of an rto through desert star  a non profit organization 
later because of ferc s acceptance of a for profit rto model and because a for profit rto was viewed as having the proper motivation to efficiently facilitate competitive markets  the company and the to s formed westconnect rto  llc westconnect  a for profit transmission company 
on october   westconnect filed its complete rto package with ferc requesting a declaratory order confirming the westconnect filing satisfies ferc s order requirements 
there were over intervenors in the westconnect docket including the new mexico attorney general  new mexico industrial energy consumers and the new mexico public regulation commission 
westconnect filed a response to the intervenors concerns on december  uncertainty exists regarding ferc s evolving rto policy 
westconnect is participating in various workshops and rulemakings before the ferc and is pursuing avenues to expand its scope so as to enhance its chances for approval as one of the rtos in the west 
ferc rulemakings over the past few months  ferc has issued numerous rulemakings 
the company is following the rulemakings and will submit its comments or will comment in conjunction with the edison electric institute eei 
westconnect is also following  attending workshops and commenting on the rulemakings  which affect the member companies  including the company 
the rulemakings of particular interest to the company include o standardizing generation interconnection agreements and procedures  o electricity market design and structure  o standards of conduct for transmission providers  and o standards for business practices of interstate natural gas pipelines 
prc transmission investigation in july  the ag filed a petition requesting that the prc initiate an investigation of electric transmission issues including ferc versus prc jurisdiction and the effect of rto formation on prc jurisdiction 
the company suggested workshops to inform the prc and other interested parties on the issues 
the prc held workshops for three days  and subsequently issued an order requiring that the company and other transmission owning entities in the proceeding file comments on jurisdictional issues 
prc renewable resources rulemakings by notice of proposed rulemaking dated february   the prc proposed the adoption of a new rule to encourage the development of renewable energy in new mexico 
the notice provided for the filing of public comments and scheduled a public hearing for april  among other things  proposed new rule would establish a renewable portfolio standard of two percent by september   increasing to five percent by september  and ten percent by september  no more than fifty percent of a utility s renewable energy resources portfolio would be allowed to be from any single type of renewable resource for purposes of compliance with the portfolio standard 
the company will submit comments to the prc 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking proceeding 
gas rates and regulation purchase gas adjustment clause the company s retail gas rate tariffs contain a pgac that provides timely recovery for the cost of gas purchased for resale to its sales service customers 
in  the company presented workshops to the prc  advocating that the pgac balancing account be reconciled on a monthly basis  rather than annually 
the company also advocated that it be allowed to earn a return on the balancing account balance 
a final order was issued in july that approves an agreement among the parties regarding the company s hedging strategy and the implementation of a price management fund program which includes a continuous monthly balancing account adjustment factor including a carrying charge set at the pre tax cost of capital approved by the prc in the company s last gas rate proceeding 
this carrying charge has the effect of keeping the company whole on gas purchase transactions whereby the company is now compensated for the time value of money 
gas hedging on november   the prc issued an order allowing but not requiring the company to implement a financial hedging strategy 
the company utilized gas options as a hedging tool for the heating season 
due to the tremendous increase in natural gas prices during the previous heating season  the transaction costs relating to hedging activities increased three fold 
through a series of workshops and hearings held with the prc and intervening parties  the company proposed without opposition  a hedging budget up to million for the heating season 
the company recovered the actual hedging expenditures as a component of the pgac during the months of october through february in equal allotments of million 
as winter gas prices were substantially lower than the previous year  the hedges placed for this winter expired unexercised 
discounted transportation fee recovery the company made a request to begin the recovery of discounted transportation fee amounts from sales and transportation customers 
discounted transportation fee recovery is a holdover issue from the new mexico state supreme court s ruling leaving open that the amounts passing the prc s cost benefit test were collectible and only the issue of allocation between customers 
the discounts passing the prc s cost benefit test total million 
a hearing date of april  has been set 
notice of inquiry on pipeline safety in may  the prc issued a notice of inquiry into whether the prc should consider adopting new rules including quality of service standards  to protect the public health and safety  public and private property  and the environment by ensuring the integrity of pipeline systems 
the prc requested information from all pipeline operators with underground or above ground facilities in the state 
the company participated in the comments and hearings in this inquiry 
subsequent prc action is pending 
environmental matters the company  in common with other electric and gas utilities  is subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local  state  federal and tribal authorities 
in addition  pvngs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc  which has authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews pursuant to the national environmental policy act 
liabilities under these laws and regulations can be material and  in some instances  may be imposed without regard to fault  or may be imposed for past acts  even though such acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred

the clean air act on july   the epa published its final regional haze regulations 
the purpose of the regional haze regulations is to address regional haze visibility impairment in the class areas in the nation  which consist of national parks  wilderness areas and other similar areas 
the final rule calls for all states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all the class areas 
the company cannot predict at this time what the impact of the implementation of the regional haze rule will be on the company s coal fired power plant operations 
potentially  additional so emission reductions could be required in the timeframe 
the nature and cost of compliance with these potential requirements cannot be determined at this time 
however  the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
new source review rules the epa has proposed changes to its new source review nsr rules that could result in many actions at power plants that have previously been considered routine repair and maintenance activities and hence not subject to the application of nsr requirements as now being subject to nsr 
in november  the department of justice  at the request of the epa  filed complaints against seven companies alleging the companies over the past years had made modifications to their plants in violation of the nsr requirements  and in some cases the new source performance standards nsps regulations 
whether or not the epa will prevail is unclear at this time 
the epa has reached a settlement with one of the companies sued by the justice department 
discovery continues in the pending litigation 
no complaint has been filed against the company  and the company believes that all of the routine maintenance  repair  and replacement work undertaken at its power plants was and continues to be in accordance with the requirements of nsr and nsps 
however  by letter dated october   the nmed made an information request of the company  advising the company that the nmed was in the process of assisting the epa in the epa s nationwide effort of verifying that changes made at the country s utilities have not inadvertently triggered a modification under the clean air act s prevention of significant determination psd policies 
the company has responded to the nmed information request 
the nature and cost of the impacts of the epa s changed interpretation of the application of the nsr and nsps  together with proposed changes to these regulations  may be significant to the power production industry 
however  the company cannot quantify these impacts with regard to its power plants 
it is also not yet known what changes in epa policy  if any  may occur in the nsr area as a result of the change in administrations in washington 
the national energy policy released may by the national energy policy development group  called for a review of the pending nsr enforcement actions and that review continues by the epa 
if the epa should prevail with its current interpretation of the nsr and nsps rules  the company may be required to make significant capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
threatened citizen suit under the clean air act by letter dated january   counsel for the grand canyon trust and sierra club collectively  gct notified the company of gct s intent to file a so called citizen suit under the clean air act  alleging that the company and co owners of the sjgs violated the clear air act  and the implementing federal and state regulations at sjgs 
the notice indicates that penalties and injunctive relief may be sought 
under the clear air act  gct must wait at least days after affording the company notice ie  until march  before filing a lawsuit 
gct has not yet filed suit 
the allegations contained in gct s notice of intent to sue fall into three categories 
first  gct contends that the plant has violated  and is currently in violation  of the federal new source performance standards nsps at all four units at sjgs 
second  gct argues that the plant has violated  and is currently in violation  of the federal psd rules  as well as the corresponding provisions of the new mexico administrative code  at all four units 
third  gct alleges that the plant has regularly violated the opacity limit contained in sjgs operating permit and set forth in federal and state regulations at units  and the company is currently investigating the allegations contained in the notice of intent to sue 
based on its investigation to date  the company firmly believes that the allegations are without merit 
by letter to gct s counsel dated february   the company vigorously disputed the allegations 
the company adheres to high environmental standards as evidenced by its international standards organization ratings 
in that letter  the company also stated that the gct has failed to provide sufficient information to permit full examination of the allegations and affirmed its compliance with the laws in question 
if a lawsuit is filed by gct  as threatened  the company will respond on behalf of the co owners and vigorously defend in the litigation 
however  the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the matter 
santa fe generating station santa fe station the company and the nmed conducted investigations of the gasoline and chlorinated solvent groundwater contamination detected beneath the company s former santa fe station site to determine the source of the contamination pursuant to a settlement agreement settlement agreement between the company and the nmed 
no source of groundwater contamination was identified as originating from the site 
however  in june  the company received a letter from the nmed  indicating that the nmed believed the company is the source of gasoline contamination in a city of santa fe municipal supply well and of groundwater underlying the santa fe station site 
further  the nmed letter stated that the company was required to proceed with interim remediation of the contamination pursuant to the new mexico water quality control commission regulations 
in october  the company and the nmed signed an amendment to the settlement agreement concerning the groundwater contamination underlying the site 
as part of the amendment  the company agreed to spend approximately million for certain costs related to sampling  monitoring and the development and implementation of a remediation plan 
the amended settlement agreement does not  however  provide the company with a full and complete release from potential further liability for remediation of the groundwater contamination 
after the company has expended the settlement amount  if the nmed can establish through binding arbitration that the santa fe station is the source of the contamination  the company could be required to perform further remediation that is determined to be necessary 
the company continues to dispute any contention that the santa fe station is the source of the groundwater contamination and believes that insufficient data exists to identify the sources of groundwater contamination 
the company s aquifer characterization and groundwater quality reports compiled from through strongly suggest groundwater contamination has been drawn under the site by the pumping of the santa fe supply well 
the company and the nmed  with the cooperation of the city of santa fe  jointly selected a to year remediation plan proposed by a remediation contractor 
the city of santa fe  the company and the nmed entered into a memorandum of understanding concerning the selected remediation plan and the operation of the municipal well adjacent to the santa fe station site in connection with carrying out the plan 
on october   a new system began operation to treat groundwater produced by the santa fe well to drinking water standards for municipal distribution and bioremediation of groundwater contamination beneath the santa fe station site 
since the reactivation of the santa fe well  the groundwater treatment and bioremediation systems have resulted in a marked reduction in contaminant concentrations at the wellhead 
however  contaminant concentrations at the property boundary remain high 
on october   the bioremediation injection system was shut down so that testing could be conducted to determine the reduction of the contaminant concentrations that has been achieved 
person station the company  in compliance with a corrective action directive issued by the nmed  determined that groundwater contamination exists in the deep and shallow groundwater at the company s person station site 
the company is required to delineate the extent of the contamination and remediate the contaminants in the groundwater at the person station site 
the extent of shallow and deep groundwater contamination was assessed and the results were reported to the nmed 
the company has received the renewal of the rcra post closure care permit for the facility 
remedial actions for the shallow and deep groundwater were incorporated into the new permit 
the company has installed and is operating a pump and treat system for the shallow groundwater 
the renewed rcra post closure care permit allows remediation of the deep groundwater contamination through natural attenuation 
the company s current estimate to decommission its retired fossil fueled plants discussed below includes approximately million in additional expenses to complete the groundwater remediation program at person station 
as part of the financial assurance requirement of the person station hazardous waste permit  the company established a trust fund 
in november  the nmed approved the company s permit modification request to terminate the trust fund 
this approval allowed the company to use an alternative method rather than the trust fund to satisfy the financial assurance requirements for post closure care 
this change was possible due to an improvement in the company s financial condition 
the remediation program continues on schedule 
fossil fueled plant decommissioning costs the company s six owned or partially owned  in service and retired  fossil fueled generating stations are expected to incur dismantling and reclamation costs as they are decommissioned 
the company s share of decommissioning costs for all of its fossil fueled generating stations is projected to be approximately million stated in dollars  including approximately million of which million has already been expended for person  prager and santa fe stations which have been retired 
the company is currently recovering estimated decommissioning costs for its in service fossil fueled generating facilities through rates charged to its retail customers 
competition under current law  the company is not in any direct retail competition with any other regulated electric and gas utility  except for sales of natural gas 
nevertheless  the company is subject to varying degrees of competition in certain territories adjacent to or within areas it serves that are also currently served by other utilities in its region as well as by rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities 
as a result of the restructuring act  as amended  the company may face competition from companies with greater financial and other resources when customer choice is implemented in there can be no assurance that the company will not face competition in the future that would adversely affect its results

the new process includes objective performance thresholds based on insights from safety studies and years of plant operating experience in the united states 
it is more timely  moving from the to month time lag of the previous oversight process for assessing plant performance to a quarterly review 
the nrc also hopes the process will be more accessible to  and readily understood by  the public 
pvngs has all indicators green the best possible of the four indicator levels 
steam generator tubes aps  as the operating agent of pvngs  has encountered tube cracking in the steam generators and has taken  and will continue to take  remedial actions that it believes have slowed the rate of tube degradation 
the projected service life of steam generators is reassessed periodically and these analyses indicate that it will be economically desirable to replace the unit steam generators in in  the pvngs participants  including the company  entered into a contract for the fabrication of two replacement steam generators for delivery in the cost of the new steam generators was updated in late the company s share of the fabrication and installation costs will be approximately million 
in december  the pvngs participants unanimously approved installation of the new steam generators in unit aps  the company and the other pvngs participants are currently considering issues related to the potential replacement of the steam generators in units and although a final determination of whether units and will require steam generator replacements to operate over their current full licensed lives has not yet been made  the company and the other participants have approved an expenditure of million of which the company s share is million in and to procure long lead time materials for fabrication of a spare set of steam generators for either unit or this action will provide the pvngs participants an option to replace the steam generators at either unit or as early as fall should they ultimately choose to do so 
if the participants decide to proceed with steam generator replacement at both units and  the company has estimated that its portion of the fabrication and installation costs and associated power uprate modifications would be approximately million over the next five years 
sale and leaseback transactions of pvngs units and in and  the company entered into a total of eleven sale and lease back transactions with an owner trust under which it sold and leased back its entire interest in pvngs units and  together with portions of the company s undivided interest in certain pvngs common facilities 
the leases under each of the sale and leaseback transactions have initial lease terms expiring january  with respect to the unit leases or january  with respect to the unit leases 
each of the leases allows the company to extend the term of the lease as well as containing a repurchase option 
the lease expense for the company s pvngs leases is approximately million per year 
throughout the terms of the leases  the company continues to have full and exclusive authority and responsibility to exercise and perform all of the rights and duties of a participant in pvngs under the arizona nuclear power project participation agreement and retains the exclusive right to sell and dispose of its share of the power and energy generated by pvngs units and the company also retains responsibility for payment of its share of all taxes  insurance premiums  operating and maintenance costs  costs related to capital improvements and decommissioning and all other similar costs and expenses associated with the leased facilities 
in  the company purchased approximately of the beneficial interests in the pvngs units and leases through the purchase of an ownership interest in the trust which held the leases 
the related ownership interests were subsequently reacquired by the company when the company s trust ownership was collapsed and the company assumed direct ownership 
in connection with the million retail rate reduction stipulated with the nmpuc in  the company wrote down the purchased beneficial interests in pvngs units and leases to million 
each lease describes certain events  events of loss or deemed loss events  the occurrence of which could require the company to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease 
the events of loss generally relate to casualties  accidents and other events at pvngs  which would severely  adversely affect the ability of the operating agent  aps  to operate  and the ability of the company to earn a return on its interests in  pvngs 
the deemed loss events consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal  or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations 
the company believes the probability of such events of loss or deemed loss events occurring is remote for the following reasons i to a large extent  prevention of events of loss and some deemed loss events is within the control of the pvngs participants  including the company  and the pvngs operating agent  through the general pvngs operational and safety oversight process and ii with respect to other deemed loss events  which would involve a significant change in current law and policy  the company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in congress  except as described below under pvngs liability and insurance matters  or in any state legislative or regulatory body that  if adopted  would cause any such events 
pvngs decommissioning funding the company has a program for funding its share of decommissioning costs for pvngs 
the nuclear decommissioning funding program is invested in equities and fixed income investments in qualified and non qualified trusts 
the results of the triannual decommissioning cost study indicated that the company s share of the pvngs decommissioning costs excluding spent fuel disposal will be approximately million in dollars 
the company funded an additional million  million and million in  and  respectively  into the qualified and non qualified trust funds 
the estimated market value of the trusts at the end of was approximately million 
the nrc amended its rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
the amended rules became effective on november  the nrc has indicated that the amendments respond to the potential rate deregulation in the power generating industry and nrc concerns regarding whether decommissioning funding assurance requirements will need to be modified 
the amended rules provide that a licensee may use an external sinking fund as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers amounts equal to estimated total decommissioning costs through cost of service rates or through a non bypassable charge 
other mechanisms are prescribed  such as prepayment  surety methods  insurance and other guarantees  if the requirements for exclusive reliance on the external sinking fund mechanism are not met 
the company currently relies on the external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for its interests in pvngs units  and the costs of pvngs units and are currently included in prc jurisdictional rates  but the costs of pvngs unit are excluded from prc jurisdictional rates 
the company has filed a report with the nrc through aps  the operating agent of pvngs  in march  concerning decommissioning funding assurance  and will continue to use the external sinking fund method as the sole financial assurance method for unit see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the restructuring act and the formation of a holding company nrc prefunding 
nuclear spent fuel and waste disposal pursuant to the nuclear waste policy act of  as amended in the waste act  the united states department of energy doe  is obligated to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors 
the nrc  pursuant to the waste act  requires operators of nuclear power reactors to enter into spent fuel disposal contracts with the doe 
under the waste act  the doe was to develop facilities necessary for the storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and to have the first facility in operation by that facility was to be a permanent repository 
the doe has announced that such a repository cannot be completed before in july  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit d 
c 
circuit ruled that the doe has an obligation to start disposing of spent nuclear fuel no later than january  by way of letter dated december   the doe informed the company and other contract holders that the doe anticipates that it would be unable to begin acceptance of nuclear spent fuel for disposal in a repository or interim storage facility by january  in november  the d 
c 
circuit issued a writ of mandamus precluding the doe from excusing its own delay on the grounds that the doe has not yet prepared a permanent repository or interim storage facility 
on may   the d 
c 
circuit issued a ruling refusing to order the doe to begin moving spent nuclear fuel 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of interim spent fuel storage costs 
on february   the president of the united states approved a recommendation of the secretary of energy that the yucca mountain site in southern nevada be developed for the storage of nuclear spent fuel 
the state of nevada has opposed this site selection and the company anticipates that there will be a protracted process to address the yucca mountain issues 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this process 
aps has storage capacity in existing fuel storage pools at pvngs which  with certain modifications  could accommodate all fuel expected to be discharged from normal operation of pvngs through approximately construction of a new facility for on site dry storage of spent fuel is underway 
once this facility is completed and approvals are granted  aps believes that spent fuel storage or disposal methods will be available for use by pvngs to allow its continued operation beyond a new low level waste facility was built in on site  which could store an amount of waste equivalent to ten years of normal operation at pvngs 
although some low level waste has been stored on site  aps is currently shipping low level waste to off site facilities 
aps currently believes that interim low level waste storage methods are or will be available for use by pvngs to allow its continued operation and to safely store low level waste until a permanent disposal facility is available 
the company believes that scientific and financial aspects of the issues of spent fuel and low level waste storage and disposal can be resolved satisfactorily 
however  the company also acknowledges that their ultimate resolution in a timely fashion will require political resolve and action on national and regional scales which the company is unable to predict at this time 
pvngs liability and insurance matters the pvngs participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy hazards to the full limit of liability under federal law 
this potential liability is covered by primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers in the amount of million and the balance by an industry wide retrospective assessment program 
if losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the primary liability insurance limit  the company could be assessed retrospective adjustments 
the maximum assessment per reactor under the program for each nuclear incident is approximately million  subject to an annual limit of million per reactor per incident 
based upon the company s interest in the three pvngs units  the company s maximum potential assessment per incident for all three units is approximately million  with an annual payment limitation of million per incident 
the insureds under this liability insurance include the pvngs participants and any other person or organization with respect to his legal responsibility for damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard 
if the funds provided by this retrospective assessment program prove to be insufficient  congress could impose revenue raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims 
aspects of the federal law referred to above the price anderson act  which provides for payment of public liability claims in case of a catastrophic accident involving a nuclear power plant  is up for renewal in august while existing nuclear power plants would continue to be covered in any event  the renewal would extend coverage to future nuclear power plants and could contain amendments that would affect existing plants 
a renewal bill was passed by the house with unanimous consent on november  the house proposed a change in the annual retrospective premium limit from million to million per reactor per incident 
additionally  the house proposed to amend the maximum potential assessment from million to million per reactor per incident  taking into account effects of inflation 
on march  the senate approved a price anderson act amendment as a part of the overall energy bill 
the senate version is substantially the same as the price anderson act in its current form 
in the event the energy bill does not pass  it is possible that the price anderson amendment will be passed as a stand alone bill 
in a report issued in  the nrc had made a number of recommendations regarding the price anderson act  including a recommendation that congress investigate whether the million now available from the private insurance market for liability claims per reactor can be increased to keep pace with inflation 
the company cannot predict whether or not congress will renew the price anderson act or act on the nrc s recommendations 
however  if adopted  certain changes in the law could possibly trigger deemed loss events under the company s pvngs leases  absent waiver by the lessors 
such an occurrence could require the company to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount as provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease see sale and leaseback transactions of pvngs units and above 
the pvngs participants maintain all risk including nuclear hazards insurance for nuclear property damage to  and decontamination of  property at pvngs in the aggregate amount of billion as of january   a substantial portion of which must be applied to stabilization and decontamination 
the company has also secured insurance against portions of the increased cost of generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from certain accidental outages of any of the three units if the outages exceed weeks 
the insurance coverage discussed in this section is subject to certain policy conditions and exclusions 
the company is a member of an industry mutual insurer 
this mutual insurer provides both the all risk and increased cost of generation insurance to the company 
in the event of adverse losses experienced by this insurer  the company is subject to an assessment 
the company s maximum share of any assessment is approximately million per year

item legal proceedings pvngs water supply litigation the company understands that a summons served on aps in required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed of arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january   in an action pending in the maricopa county superior court 
pvngs is located within the geographic area subject to the summons and the rights of the pvngs participants  including the company  to the use of groundwater and effluent at pvngs are potentially at issue in this action

pursuant to the acts  the navajo nation environmental protection agency is authorized to promulgate regulations covering air quality  drinking water and pesticide activities  including those that occur at four corners 
in february  the epa issued regulations specifying provisions of the clean air act for which it is appropriate to treat indian tribes in the same manner as states 
the epa indicated that it believes that the clean air act generally would supersede pre existing binding agreements that may limit the scope of tribal authority over reservations 
in february  the epa issued regulations under which federal operating permits for stationary sources in indian country can be issued pursuant to title v of the clean air act 
the regulations rely on authority contained in an earlier rule in which the epa outlined treatment of tribes as states under the clean air act 
the company as a participant in four corners and as operating agent and joint owner of sjgs  and owners of other facilities located on other reservations located in new mexico  filed appeals to contest the epa s authority under the regulations

kafb contract in  the company was informed that the doe had entered into an agency agreement with wapa on behalf of kafb  one of the company s largest retail electric customers  by which wapa would competitively procure power for kafb 
the proposed wholesale power procurement was to begin at the expiration of kafb s power service contract with the company in december on may   the company received a request for network transmission service from wapa pursuant to section of the federal power act to facilitate the delivery of wholesale power to kafb over the company s transmission system 
the company denied wapa s request  by letter dated june   citing the fact that kafb is and will continue to be a retail customer until the date that kafb can elect customer choice service under the provisions of the restructuring act of the company also cited several provisions of federal law that prohibit the provision of such service to wapa 
on october   wapa filed a petition requesting the ferc  on an expedited basis  to order the company to provide network transmission service to wapa on behalf of doe and several other entities located on kafb under the company s open access transmission tariff 
the petition claimed kafb is a wholesale customer of the company  not a retail customer 
by order entered on april  the ferc denied the wapa transmission application 
the ferc order determined  among other things  that wapa had failed to demonstrate that its sales to doe are sales for resale and also that wapa failed to qualify for certain claimed exemptions under the federal power act that would have entitled it to provide expanded service to doe 
wapa requested rehearing of ferc s april  order 
in a proposed order issued on june   ferc granted wapa s request for rehearing 
ferc determined that wapa qualified for an exemption to the prohibition against an order requiring service to retail customers and that ferc therefore could require the company to provide the requested service 
ferc directed the company and wapa to engage in negotiations concerning rates  terms and conditions of service  including compensation 
on january   the parties submitted a settlement agreement resolving most of the issues relating to the rates  terms and conditions of service 
the partial settlement reserved one issue for ferc decision or further proceedings 
the reserved issue relates to whether wapa is entitled to a credit against payments for transmission service for certain facilities located near kafb 
the june order is a proposed order  and is not subject to requests for rehearing or judicial review 
ferc may establish terms and conditions in a final order that would be subject to requests for rehearing and to judicial review 
the settlement agreement filed at ferc on january  reserves the company s rights to seek rehearing and judicial review of any final order and to present other legal claims 
on february   the ferc administrative judge who supervised the negotiations leading to the partial settlement recommended that ferc approve the settlement 
the company is evaluating its legal options in relation to the proposed order or any resulting final order 
in a separate but related proceeding  the company and the united states executive agencies on behalf of kafb are involved in a prc case regarding a dispute over the specific company tariff language under which the company provides retail service to kafb 
the company agreed to continue to provide service to kafb after expiration of the contract and kafb continues to purchase retail service pending resolution of all relevant issues 
the prc case has been held in abeyance  pending the outcome of the ferc proceeding

western resources on november   the company and western resources announced that both companies boards of directors approved an agreement under which the company would acquire the western resources electric utility operations in a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
the agreement required that western resources split off its non utility businesses to its shareholders prior to closing 
in july   the kcc issued two orders 
the first order declared the split off required by the agreement to be unlawful as designed  with or without a merger 
the second order decreased rates for western resources  despite a request for million increase 
after rehearing the kcc established the rate decrease at million 
on october   the kcc issued an order on reconsideration reaffirming its decision that the split off as designed in the agreement was unlawful with or without a merger 
because of these rulings  the company announced that it believed the agreement as originally structured could not be consummated 
efforts to renegotiate the transaction failed 
western resources demanded that the company file for regulatory approvals of the transaction as designed  despite the fact that the transaction required the split off already determined to be unlawful by the kcc 
as a result of the disagreement over the viability of the transaction as designed  the company filed suit on october  in new york state court seeking declarations that the transaction could not be accomplished as designed due to the kcc s determination that the split off condition of the transaction is unlawful  that the company is not obligated to pursue approvals of the transaction as designed  that the transaction is terminated effective december   without an automatic extension  and that the kcc rate case order constitutes a material adverse effect under the agreement 
the company also seeks monetary damages for breach of contract because western resources represented and warranted that the split off did not require approval of the kcc 
on november   western resources filed a complaint against the company in new york state court alleging breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
western resources alleged that the company brought about the kcc orders  failed to assist in efforts to reverse the kcc orders  refused to renegotiate within the terms of the agreement  interfered with western resources s efforts to satisfy the terms of the agreement  and effected an unauthorized de facto termination of the agreement by filing its complaint 
western resources alleges damages in excess of million 
the company believes that the complaint filed by western resources is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the complaint 
the company also intends to vigorously pursue its own complaint 
on january   the company notified western resources that it had taken action to terminate the agreement as of that date 
the company identified numerous breaches of the agreement by western resources and the regulatory rulings in kansas as reasons for the termination 
on january   western resources responded that it considered the company s termination to be ineffective and the agreement to still be in effect 
on february   the district court for shawnee county  kansas  dismissed without prejudice western resources appeal of the kcc s split off orders 
the court ruled that  by filing a new financial plan in compliance with the orders  western resources accepted certain portions of the orders thereby creating a situation where further administrative action became necessary 
as a result  the court concluded that the matter was not ripe for judicial review and remanded the case to the kcc 
on march   the kansas court of appeals affirmed the kcc s rate order 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of its litigation with western resources

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for pnm resources  inc the company and public service company of new mexico pnm is presented on a combined basis 
the company as an unconsolidated holding company holding company had no material operations for the year ended december  except for its consolidated investment in pnm  the holding company s only assets were cash of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million at december  in addition  the holding company had no liabilities at december  accordingly  the reader of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should assume that the information presented applies to consolidated results of operations and financial position of both the company and pnm  except where the context or references clearly indicate otherwise 
discussions regarding specific contractual obligations generally reference the company that is legally obligated 
in the case of contractual obligations of pnm  these obligations are consolidated with the company under generally accepted accounting principles 
broader operational discussion references the company 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and the significant factors affecting the results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
overview the company is an investor owned holding company of energy and energy related companies 
its principal subsidiary  pnm  is an integrated public utility primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale and trading of electricity  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas within the state of new mexico and the sale and trading of electricity in the western united states 
the company s principal business segments are utility operations  which include electric services electric and gas services gas  and generation and trading operations generation and trading 
electric consists of two major business lines that include distribution and transmission 
the transmission business line does not meet the definition of a segment for accounting purposes due to its immateriality  and for purposes of this discussion  it is combined with the distribution business line 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  avistar  inc avistar  provides unregulated energy services 
upon the completion on december   of a one for one share exchange between pnm and the company  the company became the parent company of pnm 
prior to the share exchange  the company had existed as a subsidiary of pnm 
the new holding company began trading on the new york stock exchange under the same pnm symbol beginning on december  competitive strategy the company is positioned as a merchant utility  primarily operating as a regulated energy service provider also engaged in the sale and trading of electricity in the competitive energy market place 
as a utility  the company has an obligation to serve its customers under the jurisdiction of the new mexico public regulation commission prc 
as a merchant  the company markets excess production from the utility  as well as  unregulated generation and its purchases for resale into a competitive market place 
the merchant operations utilize an asset backed trading strategy  whereby the company s aggregate net open position for the sale of electricity is covered by the company s excess generation capabilities 
the benefits of the merchant operations are shared with retail customers based on a negotiated settlement in proportion to capacity owned  expended effort  and risk assumed 
non regulated assets may be part of the utility company or owned by an affiliate of the utility company  which could be a subsidiary of the holding company 
currently  all non regulated assets  except avistar  are part of the utility 
both retail customers and shareholders benefit from this combination 
the electric and gas services strategy is directed at supplying reasonably priced and reliable energy to retail customers through customer driven operational excellence  quality processes  and improved overall organizational performance 
the generation and trading strategy calls for increased asset backed trading and generation capacity supported by long term contracts  as well as improved risk management strategies 
the company s plans to increase generation calls for approximately of its wholesale activity to be committed through long term contracts  including its sales to jurisdictional customers 
such growth will be dependent on market developments  and upon the company s ability to generate funds for the company s expansion 
intentionally left blank results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated the company s net earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended december  were million  a increase over net earnings of million in this increase reflects strong market pricing in the western united states in the first half of and continuing growth in utility operations 
earnings in both and were affected by certain special gains and non recurring charges 
these special items are detailed in the individual business segment discussions below 
the following table enumerates these special gains and non recurring charges and shows their effect on diluted earnings per share  in thousands  except per share amounts

the following discussion is based on the financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements segment information note 
the tables below set forth the operating results for each business segment 
year ended december  utility generation electric gas and trading operating revenues external customers    intersegment revenues  total revenues    cost of energy sold    intersegment purchases  total cost of energy    gross margin    administrative and other costs    energy production costs   depreciation and amortization    transmission and distribution costs   taxes other than income taxes    income taxes    total non fuel operating expenses    operating income    year ended december  utility generation electric gas and trading operating revenues external customers    intersegment revenues  total revenues    cost of energy sold    intersegment purchases  total cost of energy    gross margin    administrative and other costs    energy production costs    depreciation and amortization    transmission and distribution costs   taxes other than income taxes    income taxes    total non fuel operating expenses    operating income    year ended december  utility generation electric gas and trading operating revenues external customers    intersegment revenues  total revenues    cost of energy sold    intersegment purchases  total cost of energy    gross margin    administrative and other costs    energy production costs    depreciation and amortization    transmission and distribution costs   taxes other than income taxes    income taxes    total non fuel operating expenses    operating income    utility operations electric operating revenues increased million or for the period to million 
retail electricity delivery grew to million mwh in compared to million mwh delivered in the prior year period  resulting in increased revenues of million year over year 
this volume increase was the result of load growth from economic expansion in new mexico 
in addition  revenues from third party use of the company s transmission system increased million as a result of additional contracts  while revenues also benefited from a million increase in revenue from property leasing 
the following table shows electric revenues by customer class and average customers electric revenues thousands of dollars residential   commercial   industrial   other   average customers   the following table shows electric sales by customer class electric sales megawatt hours residential   commercial   industrial   other the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million  which reflects the increased energy sales  transmission revenue and property leasing revenue  partially offset by higher cost for the electricity sold to retail customers 
electric exclusively purchases power from generation and trading at company developed prices which are not based on market rates 
these intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated results 
administrative and general costs increased million or for the period 
this increase is primarily due to increased pension and post retirement benefits expense resulting primarily from a reduction in expected investment returns on plan assets 
consulting expenses focused on cost control and process improvement initiatives also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt and collection expense 
by december  the company had resolved most of the problems associated with the implementation of its new billing system 
as a result bad debt expense was significantly lower in transmission and distribution costs increased million or primarily due to a non recurring increase in maintenance to improve reliability for the transmission and distribution systems 
taxes other than income decreased million or reflecting favorable audit outcomes by certain tax authorities and tax planning strategies 
gas operating revenues increased million or for the period to million 
the company purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at cost to its distribution customers 
as a result  increased gas revenues driven by increased gas costs do not impact the company s gross margin or earnings 
the revenue increase was driven primarily by a increase in average gas prices in the first half of  resulting from increased market demand 
in addition  a volume increase and a gas rate increase  which became effective october  contributed to the increase 
the gas rate increase added million of revenue 
transportation volume increased or million 
this growth was primarily attributed to gas transportation customers whose increased demand was driven by the strong power market in the western united states during the first half of this increase is not expected to recur in approximately million of gas revenue in was attributable to the company s generation and trading operations and is eliminated in the consolidated results 
the following table shows gas revenues by customer and average customers gas revenues thousands of dollars residential   commercial   industrial   transportation   other   average customers   the following table shows gas throughput by customer class gas throughput thousands of decatherms residential   commercial   industrial   transportation   other   customer owned gas 
the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million or 
this increase is due to the rate increase and higher transportation volumes  which will likely not recur in  as discussed above 
administrative and general costs increased million or 
this increase is due to increased pension and post retirement benefits expense resulting primarily from a reduction in expected investment returns on plan assets  consulting expenses in connection with cost control and process improvement initiatives  partially offset by decreased bad debt and collection costs 
depreciation and amortization increased million or for the period due to a higher depreciable plant base 
transmission and distribution costs increased million or primarily due to a non recurring increase in maintenance to improve reliability for the transmission and distribution systems  as the company continues to focus on improving reliability and effectiveness of its retail distribution system 
taxes other than income decreased million or due to favorable audit outcomes by certain tax authorities and tax planning strategies 
generation and trading operations a spike in regional wholesale electric prices occurred in the first half of and the second half of this spike was caused by the power supply demand imbalance in the western united states  limited power generation capacity and increased natural gas prices 
the company does not believe that the high wholesale prices seen in and will recur in at the end of the second quarter of  the market experienced falling price levels 
this trend continued in the last half of as a result  market liquidity the opportunity to buy and resell power profitably in the marketplace also declined reflecting the bankruptcy of a major market trader and limited price volatility 
the company believes that current weak market pricing is not sustainable and that prices will adjust to more normal historical levels in the second half of operating revenues grew million or for the period to billion 
this increase in wholesale electricity sales primarily reflects the strong regional wholesale electric prices in the first half of the company delivered wholesale bulk power of million mwh of electricity this period  compared to million mwh in the prior period 
wholesale revenues from third party customers increased from million to billion  an increase 
the following table shows revenues by customer class generation and trading revenues by market thousands of dollars intersegment sales   firm requirements wholesale   other wholesale sales   the following table shows sales by customer class generation and trading sales by market megawatt hours intersegment sales   firm requirements wholesale   other wholesale sales   includes mark to market gains losses 
the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million or 
the company s margins benefit significantly from rising gas prices as most of the company s generation portfolio is fueled by stable priced fuel sources  such as coal and uranium 
as the increase in gas prices puts upward pressure on electricity prices  the profitability of the company s stable low cost generation increases significantly 
margins also benefited from the company s power trading activities 
the company buys and then resells electricity in the market generating incremental margin by taking advantage of price changes in the electricity sales market 
in addition  the company also tailors electric deliveries for its wholesale customers creating incremental margin opportunities 
generally  as market prices decline  trading volumes rise supporting margin levels in lower price electric markets 
these higher margins were partially offset by a year over year increase in unrealized mark to market losses of million which the company recognized relating to its power trading contracts 
administrative and general costs increased million or for the period 
this increase is primarily due to increased pension and post retirement benefits expense  higher power marketing expenses of million mainly for additional incentive bonuses and certain consulting fees  and other expenses related to business development and process improvement 
this increase was partially offset by lower year over year generation and trading business development costs due to significant costs related to the acquisition of a long term wholesale customer 
energy production costs increased million or for the year 
the increase is primarily due to higher maintenance costs in resulting from scheduled and unscheduled outages at palo verde nuclear generating station pvngs  san juan generating station sjgs and reeves generating station reeves  additional incentive bonuses at sjgs  and increased generation at reeves  one of the company s gas generation facilities  which has a higher cost of production than the company s coal and nuclear facilities 
this increase was partially offset by lower maintenance costs at four corners power plant four corners as a result of decreased outage time 
a significant unscheduled outage occurred in the fall of at sjgs 
the company took advantage of the outage to accelerate its outage scheduled for the spring of as a result  maintenance costs and the related lost market potential of the accelerated outage will be avoided in the spring of depreciation and amortization increased million or for the period due to a higher depreciable plant base 
taxes other than income decreased million or as a result of favorable audit outcomes by certain tax authorities and tax planning strategies 
unregulated businesses in july  the board of directors of avistar decided to wind down all unregulated operations except for avistar s reliadigm business unit  which provides maintenance solutions and technologies to the electric power industry 
avistar had previously divested itself of its energy partners business unit and liquidated axon field services and pathways integration 
this divestiture was largely in response to market disruptions caused by the california energy crisis 
in addition  the transfer of operation of the sangre de cristo water company to the city of santa fe was completed in the third quarter 
all remaining non reliadigm investments were written off with the exception of avistar s investment in nth power  an energy related venture capital fund 
these write downs reflect the significant decline in the technology market and bankruptcy of these investees 
the company recorded non operating charges of million to reflect these activities and the impairment of its avistar investments 
due to the cessation of much of avistar s historic operations  business activity declined significantly 
revenues decreased for the period to million 
operating losses for avistar decreased from million in the prior year period to million in the current year period primarily due to decreased costs as a result of the shutdown of certain operations 
in january  avistar was dividended to pnm resources by pnm 
corporate corporate administrative and general costs  which represent costs that are driven exclusively by corporate level activities  decreased million for the period to million 
this decrease was due to lower bonus expense in and reorganizational costs incurred in that did not occur in due to the delay in separating utility operations from generation and trading operations 
these cost improvements were partially offset by higher legal costs associated with routine business operations and increased pension and post retirement benefit expense 
other non operating costs other income and deductions  net of taxes  decreased million for the period to a loss of million 
on a pre tax basis in  the company recognized gains of million related to the settlement of a lawsuit  million for the reversal of certain reserves associated with the resolution of two gas rate cases and million related to the company s hedge of certain non qualified retirement plan trust assets 
in the current year  the company recorded pre tax charges of million to write off certain permanently impaired avistar investments and million of non recoverable coal mine decommissioning costs previously established as a regulatory asset 
the company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of regulatory assets as the rate making process occurs and will identify its stranded costs  if any  when it files its new transition plan that is due by january  the current year results also include the following pre tax items a donation of million to the pnm foundation  unrecoverable costs of million related to an abandoned transmission line expansion project  a year over year decrease in investment income of million on the pvngs decommissioning trust assets  and increased costs of million related to the company s terminated acquisition of western resources electric utility operations  partially offset by million of equity income from a passive investment 
total costs for the year ended december  related to the company s terminated acquisition of western resources were million pre tax 
the company has expensed all costs related to the terminated transaction to date 
the company s consolidated income tax expense was million in the twelve months ended december   an increase of million for the year 
the impact of higher earnings was partially mitigated by the reversal of million of valuation allowances taken against certain income tax related regulatory assets in that the company determined would continue to be recoverable in rates largely due to the delay in the implementation of deregulation 
the company s effective income tax rates for the years ended and were and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the valuation reserve changes  the company s effective income tax rates for the years ended and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to the favorable tax treatment received on the equity earnings discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated the company s net earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended december  were million  a increase over net earnings of million in this increase reflects strong market pricing in the western united states in the second half of and continuing growth in utility operations 
earnings in both and were affected by certain special gains and charges 
these special items are detailed in the individual business segment discussions below 
the following table enumerates these special gains and charges and shows their effect on diluted earnings per share  in thousands  except per share amounts

utility operations electric operating revenues declined million or for the year to million due to the implementation in late july of the rate order lowering rates by million year over year 
this was mostly offset by increased retail electricity delivery of million mwh compared to million mwh delivered in the prior year period  a improvement which increased revenues million year over year 
this increased volume was the result of warm temperatures and load growth 
the following table shows electric revenues by customer class electric revenues thousands of dollars residential   commercial   industrial   other   average customers   the following table shows electric sales by customer class electric sales megawatt hours residential   commercial   industrial   other the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  decreased million 
this decline reflects the rate reduction discussed above 
electric exclusively purchases power from generation and trading at company developed prices which are not based on market rates 
administrative and general costs decreased million or for the year 
this decrease is due to non recurring year yk compliance costs and non recurring costs related to the company s implementation of its new customer billing system in in addition  in  as a result of significant increases in delinquent accounts due to system implementation problems  the company incurred additional bad debt costs of million above its normal experience rate 
bad debt expense in was million  a decline for the year 
energy production costs decreased million or for the year primarily due to non recurring yk compliance costs in depreciation and amortization increased million or for the year 
the increase is due to the impact of amortizing the costs of the new customer billing system  which has a five year amortization life  and depreciating the expansion of the electric distribution system 
transmission and distribution costs increased million or for the year primarily due to increased scheduled maintenance of transmission lines and the addition of station related equipment for reliability purposes 
this increase in scheduled maintenance continued in taxes other than income decreased million or due to a change in the recognition of electric franchise fees collected from customers and payable to municipalities  partially offset by the impact of the implementation of the new customer billing system on the collection of certain taxes and an increase in expected tax liabilities 
franchise fees were a part of the company s rate structure in in  they were unbundled from the rate structure 
as a result  the company now passes through directly to customers the franchise fees charged by municipalities and does not incur expense or generate revenues as a result of collecting the fees 
gas operating revenues increased million or for the year to million 
the company purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at cost to its distribution customers 
as a result  increased gas revenues driven by increased gas costs do not impact the company s gross margin or earnings 
the increase was driven by a increase in gas prices in the later months of as a result of increased market demand  a volume increase 
the following table shows gas revenues by customer class gas revenues thousands of dollars residential   commercial   industrial   transportation   other   average customers   the following table shows gas throughput by customer class gas throughput thousands of decatherms residential   commercial   industrial   transportation   other   customer owned gas 
the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million or 
this increase is due to higher retail customer distribution volumes on which the company earns cost of service revenues 
administrative and general costs decreased million or 
this decrease is mainly due to non recurring yk compliance costs  customer billing system costs and lower associated bad debt costs 
the electric and gas services share the same billing system  and gas services experienced the same delinquency problems discussed above in the electric results of operations 
as a result  in  the company incurred additional bad debt costs of million above its normal experience rate 
however  bad debt expense did not significantly decline in as the company increased its bad debt costs by approximately million in anticipation of a higher than normal delinquency rate driven by the significantly higher natural gas prices experienced in november and december this trend is similar to historic collection trends associated with past gas price spikes 
depreciation and amortization increased million or for the year 
the increase is due to the impact of amortizing the costs of a new customer billing system and depreciating the expansion of the gas transmission system 
transmission and distribution costs decreased million or primarily due to non recurring yk compliance costs 
taxes other than income increased million or primarily due to higher tax liabilities and the impact of the implementation of the new customer billing system on the collection of certain taxes 
generation and trading operations operating revenues grew million or for the year to billion 
this increase in wholesale electricity sales reflects strong regional wholesale electric prices caused by a warm summer  limited power generation capacity  increasing natural gas prices and the power supply imbalance in the western united states 
these factors contributed to unusually high wholesale prices which the company does not believe to be sustainable in the long term  although these factors continued to affect markets in the first half of the company delivered wholesale bulk power of million mwh this period compared to million mwh delivered last year  an increase of 
the mwh increase is attributable to increased trading activity during the year 
wholesale revenues from third party customers increased from million to million  a increase 
the increase was largely price driven

the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million or 
higher margins were partially offset by million of losses associated with the company s assessment of risk in the wholesale market and unrealized mark to market losses of million which the company recognized relating to its power trading contracts 
these items were recorded as revenue adjustments 
administrative and general costs increased million or for the year 
this increase is due to a one time charge of million in connection with the acquisition of a new  long term wholesale customer and an increase in bad debt costs  partially offset by non recurring yk compliance costs and lower legal costs related to a lawsuit settlement involving the company s decommissioning trust which was settled in august the settlement was recorded as other income 
energy production costs increased million or for the year 
these costs are generation related 
the increase is due to higher maintenance costs resulting from scheduled outages at san juan unit and four corners unit  which were partially offset by lower pvngs employee costs as a result of additional employee incentive and retiree healthcare costs in the prior year that did not recur in and additional pvngs billings in for expenses as a result of an audit by the station owners 
taxes other than income increased million or due to higher tax liabilities 
unregulated businesses avistar contributed million in revenues for the year compared to million in the comparable prior year period due to lower business volumes resulting from slow developing markets associated with avistar s new product offerings 
operating losses for avistar increased from million in the prior year to million in the current year 
corporate corporate administrative and general costs  which represent costs that are driven exclusively by corporate level activities  increased million for the year to million 
this increase was due to additional administrative and consulting expenses for strategic initiatives  higher legal costs and reorganizational costs incurred in anticipation of separating utility operations under the restructuring act 
other non operating costs other income and deductions  net of taxes  increased million for the year to million due to certain special gains 
the company recognized on a pre tax basis million related to the settlement of a lawsuit and million before income taxes associated with the resolution of two gas rate cases 
the current year also had increased mark to market gains on the company s hedge of its investments for nuclear decommissioning and certain post retirement benefits 
these gains were partially offset by million of costs related to the company s terminated western resources transaction 
in addition  other income and deductions included a valuation loss recognized for avistar s amdax 
com investment  and expenses related to the transfer of the operation of the city of santa fe s water system to the municipality 
in  other income and deductions included gains  on a pre tax basis  of million of equity income from a passive investment and million from closing down certain coal mine reclamation activities in an inactive subsidiary 
net interest charges decreased million for the period to million primarily as a result of the retirement of million of senior unsecured notes in june and august and million in january the company s consolidated income tax expense  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change  was million  an increase of million for the year 
the company s income tax effective rate  before the cumulative effect of the accounting change  was 
included in the company s income tax expense is the write off of million of income tax related regulatory assets 
excluding the write off of income tax related regulatory assets  the company s effective tax rate was 
the company s effective tax rate was 
the increase in the rate was primarily due to the favorable tax treatment received on the equity earnings in other income and deductions discussed above 
future expectations because of the wholesale market price decline in the western united states that began in the second half of  the company s earnings are not expected to reach levels 
on january   the company announced that it expects its earnings to be at the lower end of the previously identified range of to per share 
wholesale prices in the west currently remain at lower levels than the company believes likely to prevail through the remainder of  however  the company expects this reduced pricing environment to continue through much of the first and second quarters 
the company s view is based on a return to normal weather  a beginning of economic recovery by summer and the reemergence of liquidity in the wholesale market that was impacted by the bankruptcy of a major trader and credit quality reduction of other market traders 
accordingly  the company believes that the lower end of the range  per share in earnings  is achievable for  and the first quarter earnings are likely to be consistent with trends from the first quarter in however  if wholesale prices in the west do not increase as forecasted by the company  the company s earnings are likely to be lower than its identified range of to 
the calculation of future expected earnings is subject to numerous variables  including  on and off peak wholesale demand  retail load needs  natural gas prices  generating resource availability  the current position of the company s trading portfolio and general economic conditions 
as a result of the reduced pricing environment  many generators have announced the cancellation of previously planned projects 
the company expects that forward prices will again move upwards in future periods as result of under building 
as the company adds new generation resources  it is expected that earnings will trend upwards as sales volumes grow 
this growth is expected to be in high single digits over the long term 
the company s strategic plan to add generation resources will provide electric wholesale volume growth beginning in and in the later years of the forecast 
this discussion of future expectations is forward looking information within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of the achievement of expected results is dependent upon the assumptions described in the preceding discussion  and is qualified in its entirety by the private securities litigation reform act of disclosure see disclosure regarding forward looking statements below and the factors described within the disclosure that could cause the company s actual financial results to differ materially from the expected results enumerated above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the company s results of operations and financial position 
the selection and application of those policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the judgments and uncertainties inherent in this process affect the application of those policies 
as a result  there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management has identified the following accounting policies that it deems critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that involve significant subjectivity 
management believes that its selection and application of these policies best represent the operating results and financial position of the company 
the following discussion provides information on the processes utilized by management in making judgments and assumptions as they apply to its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues in the period of delivery 
the company s utility operations are required to estimate revenues for unbilled services when its billing cycle does not match the calendar end reporting period 
management s estimates are based on models which utilize actual units delivered and the applicable rate structure 
utility operation s gas operating revenues exclude adjustments for differences in gas purchase costs that are above or below levels included in base rates but are recoverable under the mechanism established by the prc 
utility operations recognize this adjustment when it is permitted to bill under prc guidelines 
utility operations  also  periodically hedge natural gas purchases to limit commodity price volatility 
unrealized gains and losses from natural gas related swaps  futures and forward contracts are deferred and recognized as the natural gas is sold and is recovered through gas rates charged to customers 
the company enters into energy trading contracts to take advantage of market opportunities associated with the purchase and sale of electricity 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of price movements on generation and trading operations contracts are recognized as adjustments to generation and trading operations operating revenues 
these adjustments are based on market prices that are actively quoted 
financial instruments under the derivative accounting rules and the related accounting rules for energy trading activities  the company accounts for its various financial derivative instruments for the purchase and sale of energy differently based on management s intent when entering into the contract 
energy trading contracts are recorded at fair market value at each period end 
the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
non trading contracts must be accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at their fair value 
changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting or normal purchase and sale criteria are met 
should an energy transaction qualify as a hedge  fair market value changes from period to period are recognized on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
gains or losses are recognized when the hedged transaction occurs 
normal purchases and sales are not marked to market but rather recorded in results of operations when the underlying transaction occurs 
the market prices used to value the company s energy trading contracts are based on closing exchange prices and over the counter quotations 
as of december   the company does not have any outstanding contracts that were valued using methods other than quoted prices 
the company did not change its methods for valuing its trading contracts in as compared to the company recognized a million loss related to its mark to market adjustment in this represents the net change in the company s mark to market adjustment for its trading contracts from december  to december  the following table summarizes the company s trading portfolio at december in thousands face value of contracts   market value of contracts   mark to market loss   the trading portfolio positions at december  and represent net liabilities after netting all open purchase and sale contracts 
because the contractual amounts required to settle the net liability were greater than the current market values of the contracts  the company recognized mark to market losses for the differences in and as of december   a decrease in market pricing of the company s trading contracts by would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of less than 
conversely  an increase in market pricing of the company s trading contracts by would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of less than at december   the market value of the company s normal sales and purchases of electricity was a million liability using the valuation methods described above 
if these transactions were classified as trading or did not meet the definition of normal under the accounting rules for derivatives  the company would have recognized unrealized gains of million as an adjustment to generation and trading operations operating revenues based on the change in fair value of these contracts from january  to december  in addition to the fair market valuation described above  the company provides for losses due to market and credit risk in the electric wholesale marketplace based on its assessment of counterparty default risk 
this assessment is based on a methodology that considers the credit ratings of the company s counterparties  the price volatility in the marketplace  the fair market value of all contracts outstanding and management s evaluation of market trends that are expected to impact market risk 
the resulting amount is recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
increases in market prices  increases in an individual counterparty s credit position and general economic conditions which may impact the credit ratings of the company s counterparties will generally result in an increased market volatility and credit risk and a corresponding reduction to revenues 
regulatory assets and liabilities the accounting rules for rate regulated entities require a company to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in its financial statements 
in accordance with these accounting rules  the company has deferred certain costs that are rate recoverable and recorded certain liabilities for amounts to be returned to retail customers pursuant to the rate actions of the prc and its predecesor and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
substantially all of the company s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are reflected in rates charged to retail customers or have been addressed in a regulatory proceeding 
to the extent that management concludes that the recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable due to changes in regulatory treatment  the effects of competition or other factors  the amount would be recorded as a charge to earnings as recovery is no longer probable 
the company currently has fixed electricity rates for jurisdictional service purposes until january if the present rates were materially reduced  management would need to re evaluate the recoverability of its regulatory assets 
if management were to determine that the new rate structure would not be sufficient to recover these regulatory assets  the company would be required to record a charge for the portion of the costs that were not recoverable 
the company has discontinued the application of regulatory accounting as of december   for the generation portion of its business effective with the passage in new mexico of the electric utility industry restructuring act of the company evaluates these assets under the same impairment rules that it uses to evaluate tangible long lived assets 
in  the company determined certain costs would not be recovered and recorded a charge of million to earnings for these amounts 
the company believes that it will recover costs associated with its remaining stranded assets  including asset closure costs  through a non bypassable charge as permitted by the restructuring act  or in future rate cases prior to implementation of customer choice 
if management were to determine that the expected non bypassable charge or other rate treatment would not be sufficient to recover these costs  the company would be required to record a charge to earnings for that portion of the costs that were not recoverable 
asset impairment the company regularly evaluates the carrying value of its tangible long lived assets in relation to their future undiscounted cash flows to assess recoverability in accordance with accounting rules 
impairment testing of power generation assets is performed periodically in response to changes in market conditions resulting from industry deregulation and other market trends 
power generation assets used to supply jurisdictional and wholesale markets are evaluated on a group basis using future undiscounted cash flows based on current open market price conditions 
the company also has generation assets that are used for the sole purpose of reliability 
these assets are tested as an individual group 
power generation assets held under operating leases are not currently evaluated for impairment as prescribed by current gaap 
the company s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is based on its assumptions of future market trends for the price of electricity such as demand  pricing and volatility 
adverse developments in the wholesale electricity market that lead to less favorable assumptions about future market trends could result in an impairment of the company s power generation assets 
contingent liabilities there are various claims and lawsuits pending against the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the company has recorded a liability where the effect of litigation can be estimated and where an outcome is considered probable 
management s estimates are based on its knowledge of the relevant facts at the time of the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of the company s liability 
environmental issues the company records its environmental liabilities when site assessments or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
the company reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  current laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  the company records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and short term and long term investments of million compared to million in the company s long term investments are highly liquid though its intent is to hold them longer than one year 
cash provided from operating activities in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from this increase was primarily the result of increased profitability 
contributing to this increase was the recovery of the cost of purchased gas from utility customers deferred in accordance with prc regulations 
in addition  the company was not required to make the first quarter estimated federal income tax payment because of an automatic extension granted by the irs to taxpayers in several counties in new mexico as a result of wildfires in this payment was made in january partially offsetting these cash inflows was the impact of lower wholesale electric and gas prices at year end  resulting in a decrease in accounts payable  however  these same price decreases led to an offsetting decrease in accounts receivable 
this market effect resulted in a net cash outflow of million  year over year 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in this increase reflects the movement of million of cash to investments with longer maturities  ranging from one to three years  and greater yields 
in addition  cash used for investing activities includes construction expenditures related to the company s announced new generating plants of million in compared to million for similar expenditures in and expenditures of million in related to the acquisition of certain transmission assets and other related investing activities compared to million for similar expenditures in the company continues to make significant investments in its generation portfolio 
cash generated by financing activities was million compared to million of cash used in financing activities in were primarily short term borrowings for liquidity reasons  offset by cash payments for dividend requirements 
the use of cash in reflects the repurchase of million of senior unsecured notes at a cost of million and common stock repurchases of million 
pension and other postretirement benefits in  the investment market experienced significant declines due to various reasons 
in addition  the future outlook for the investment market is not expected to improve in the short term 
as a result  the company adjusted the expected rate of return on its pension and other postretirement benefit plans assets 
for the year ended december   the company s net periodic benefit cost assumed a rate of return as compared to in the prior year 
the rate adjustment reflects the company s outlook for asset returns after considering the events of september  and the impact of asset losses recognized in the september  plan valuation 
this change resulted in an increase of million in the company s recorded net periodic benefit expense 
in addition  increases in the health care cost trend contributed an additional million of increased costs 
total net periodic benefit cost for all plans was million in as compared to million in the actual return on the plan s assets for the year ended december  was a loss of million 
as a result  the company recorded a tax effected decrease in other comprehensive income of million 
the actual losses recorded in other comprehensive income will be recognized in the company s future results of operations to the extent that future calculations of the net periodic benefit expense s assumed rate of return reflects the losses 
the accounting rules for pension plans and other postretirement benefits allow investment gains and losses to be recognized in a systematic and rational method 
this methodology reduces the periodic impact of market volatility 
in january  the company made an aggregate contribution of million to fund the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the effect of this contribution will be to reduce the impact that the actual investment losses will have on the company s future net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the company believes that its expected rate of return in will be at historical levels 
capital requirements total capital requirements include construction expenditures as well as other major capital requirements and cash dividend requirements for both common and preferred stock 
the main focus of the company s construction program is upgrading generation systems  upgrading and expanding the electric and gas transmission and distribution systems and purchasing nuclear fuel 
in addition  the company anticipates significant expenditures to expand its wholesale generation capabilities 
projections for total capital requirements for are million and projections for construction expenditures for are million 
for projections  total capital requirements are billion and construction expenditures are billion  including the combustion turbines discussed below 
these estimates are under continuing review and subject to on going adjustment 
the company has committed to purchase five combustion turbines at a total cost of million 
the turbines for three planned power generation plants with a combined capacity of mws 
the estimated cost of construction of the plants is approximately million 
the company has expended million as of december  in november  the company broke ground for afton generating station afton  a mw natural gas fired generating plant on a site in southern new mexico 
this facility is expected to be operational by october currently  the company plans to expand the facility to mw by the end of in february  the company also broke ground to build lordsburg generating station lordsburg  an mw natural gas fired generating plant in southwestern new mexico 
this facility is expected to be operational by july the planned plants are part of the company s ongoing competitive strategy of increasing generation capacity over time 
the costs of these plants are not anticipated to be added to the rate base 
the company s construction expenditures for were entirely funded through cash generated from operations 
to meet its capital needs for its planned expansion of its generation capabilities  the company expects that it will have to access the capital markets 
otherwise  the company anticipates that internal cash generation and current debt capacity will be sufficient to meet all its other capital requirements for the years through to cover the difference in the amounts and timing of cash generation and cash requirements  the company intends to use short term borrowings under its liquidity arrangements 
liquidity at march   pnm had million of available liquidity arrangements  consisting of million from an unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility  and million in local lines of credit 
the credit facility will expire in march there were million in borrowings as of march  in addition  the holding company has a million reciprocal borrowing agreement with pnm and million in local lines of credit 
the company s ability to finance its construction program at a reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs is largely dependent upon its ability to earn a fair return on equity  results of operations  credit ratings  regulatory approvals and financial and wholesale market conditions 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources and having the ability  if necessary  to issue long term securities  and to obtain short term credit 
pnm s credit outlook is considered positive by moody s investor services moody s and fitch ratings fitch and stable by standard and poors s p 
previously  in connection with pnm s announcement of its agreement to acquire western resources electric utility operations  s p  moody s and fitch placed pnm s securities ratings on negative credit watch pending review of the transaction 
as a result of events which led the company to conclude the acquisition could not be accomplished  ultimately leading the company to terminate the transaction in january  s p  moody s and fitch removed the company from negative credit watch 
the company is committed to maintaining its investment grade 
s p currently rates pnm s senior unsecured notes suns and its eastern interconnection project eip senior secured debt bbb and its preferred stock bb

investors are cautioned that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
long term obligations and commitments the following table shows pnm s long term debt and operating leases as of december  as of march   the holding company has no long term obligations except those consolidated with pnm 
payments due in thousands contractual less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      pnm leases interests in units and of pvngs  certain transmission facilities  office buildings and other equipment under operating leases 
the lease expense for pvngs is million per year over base lease terms expiring in and in  pnm established pvngs capital trust capital trust for the purpose of acquiring all the debt underlying the pvngs leases 
pnm consolidates capital trust in its consolidated financial statements 
the purchase was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of million of suns  which were loaned to capital trust 
capital trust then acquired and now holds the debt component of the pvngs leases 
for legal and regulatory reasons  the pvngs lease payment continues to be recorded and paid gross with the debt component of the payment returned to pnm via capital trust 
as a result  the net cash outflows for the pvngs lease payment were million in the table above reflects the net lease payment 
pnm s other significant operating lease obligations include the eastern interconnect project eip  a transmission line with annual lease payments of million and a power purchase agreement for the entire output of delta persons generating station delta  a gas fired generating plant in albuquerque  new mexico with imputed annual lease payments of million 
the company s off balance sheet obligations are limited to pnm s operating leases and certain financial instruments related to the purchase and sale of energy see below 
the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta ppa was million as of december  pnm has entered various long term power purchase agreements obligating it to make aggregate fixed payments of million plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through july in addition  pnm is obligated to sell electricity for million in fixed payments plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through june pnm s trading portfolio as of december  included open contract positions to buy million of electricity and to sell million of electricity 
in addition  pnm had open contract positions classified as normal sales of electricity under the derivative accounting rules of million and normal purchases of electricity of million 
pnm has a coal supply contract for the needs of san juan generating station sjgs until the contract contemplates the delivery of approximately million tons of coal during its remaining term 
the pricing is based on the cost of extraction plus a margin 
pnm contracts for the purchase of gas to serve its jurisdictional customers 
these contracts are short term in nature supplying the gas needs for the current heating season and the following off season months 
the price of gas is a pass through  whereby the company recovers of its cost of gas 
contingent provisions of certain obligations the holding company and pnm have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions 
some of these  if triggered  could affect the liquidity of the company 
the holding company and or pnm could be required to provide security  immediately pay outstanding obligations or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements  if the contingent requirements were to be triggered 
the most significant consequences resulting from these contingent requirements are detailed in the discussion below 
pnm s master purchase agreement for the procurement of gas for its jurisdictional customers contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security for its gas purchase obligations if the seller were to reasonably believe that pnm was unable to fulfill its payment obligations under the agreement 
the master agreement for the sale of electricity in the western system power pool wspp contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security if its debt were to fall below the investment grade rating 
the wspp agreement also contains a contingent requirement  commonly called a material adverse change mac provision  which could require pnm to provide security if a material adverse change in its financial condition or operations were to occur 
pnm s committed credit facility contains a mac provision which if triggered could prevent pnm from drawing on its unused capacity under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility contains a contingent requirement that requires pnm to maintain a debt to capital ratio of less than 
if pnm s debt to capital ratio were to exceed  pnm could be required to repay all borrowings under the credit facility  be prevented from drawing on the unused capacity under the credit facility  and be required to provide security for all outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
at december   the company had million of letters of credit outstanding 
if a contingent requirement were to be triggered under the credit facility resulting in an acceleration of the outstanding loans under the credit facility  a cross default provision in the pvngs leases could occur if the accelerated amount is not paid 
if a cross default provision is triggered  the lessors have the ability to accelerate their rights under the leases  including acceleration of all future lease payments 
planned financing activities pnm has million of long term debt that matures in august all other long term debt matures in or later 
the company could enter into other long term financings for the purpose of strengthening its balance sheet  funding growth and reducing its cost of capital 
the company continues to evaluate its investment and debt retirement options to optimize its financing strategy and earnings potential 
no additional first mortgage bonds may be issued under pnm s mortgage 
the amount of suns that may be issued is not limited by the suns indenture 
however  debt to capital requirements in certain of pnm s financial instruments would ultimately limit the amount of suns pnm would issue 
pnm currently has million of tax exempt bonds outstanding that are callable at a premium in december and august pnm intends to refinance these bonds assuming the interest rate of the refinancing does not exceed the current interest rate and has hedged the entire planned refinancing 
in order to take advantage of current low interest rates  pnm entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps in november and december and three additional contracts subsequent to december  pnm designated these swaps as cash flow hedges 
the hedged risks associated with these instruments are the changes in cash flows related to general moves in interest rates expected for the refinancing 
the swaps effectively cap the interest rate on the refinancing to plus an adjustment for pnm s and industry s credit rating 
pnm s assessment of hedge effectiveness is based on changes in the hedge interest rates 
the derivative accounting rules  as amended  provide that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
any hedge ineffectiveness is required to be presented in current earnings 
there was no material hedge ineffectiveness in the year ended december  a forward starting swap does not require any upfront premium and captures changes in the corporate credit component of an investment grade company s interest rate as well as the underlying treasury benchmark 
the five forward starting interest rate swaps have termination dates and notional amounts as follows one with a termination date of september  for a notional amount of million and four with a termination date of may  for a combined notional amount of million 
there were no fees on the transaction  as they are imbedded in the rates  and the transaction is cash settled on the mandatory unwind date strike date  corresponding to the refinancing date of the underlying debt 
the settlement will be capitalized as a cost of issuance and amortized over the life of the debt as a yield adjustment 
if the hedged corporate interest rate along with the underlying benchmark were to decline below the capped level of the hedge  pnm will have to pay to settle the forward starting swap but would be able to issue the refinanced debt at the lower interest rate 
however  if the hedged corporate interest rate along with the underlying benchmark were to decline but the interest rates available to pnm at the time of refinancing are greater than the existing rate of the debt to be refinanced due to credit issues  pnm will incur a loss on the hedge and not refinance the debt 
stock repurchase in march  pnm s board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock with maximum purchase price of per share 
in december  pnm board of directors authorized pnm to repurchase up to an additional million of its common stock 
as of december   pnm repurchased  shares of its previously outstanding common stock at a cost of million 
from january through march  pnm repurchased an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock at a cost of million 
on august   pnm s board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through the end of the first quarter of from august  through december   pnm repurchased an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock at a cost of million 
the total cost of stock repurchased for the year ended december  was million 
there were no repurchases of common stock during the year ended december  the board of directors has authorized additional stock repurchases but the company has not exercised that new authority 
dividends the company s board of directors reviews the company s dividend policy on a continuing basis 
the declaration of common dividends is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends 
currently  pnm is the company s primary source of dividends 
as part of the order approving the formation of the holding company  the prc placed certain restrictions on the ability of pnm to pay dividends to its parent 
the prc order imposed the following conditions regarding dividends paid by pnm to the holding company pnm can not pay dividends which cause its debt rating to go below investment grade  and pnm can not pay dividends in any year  as determined on a rolling four quarter basis  in excess of net earnings without prior prc approval 
additionally  pnm has various financial covenants which limit the transfer of assets  through dividends or other means 
in addition  the ability of the company to declare dividends is dependent upon the extent to which cash flows will support dividends  the availability of retained earnings  its financial circumstances and performance  the prc s decisions in various regulatory cases currently pending and which may be docketed in the future  the effect of deregulating generation markets and market economic conditions generally 
the ability to recover stranded costs in deregulation as amended  conditions imposed on holding company formation  future growth plans and the related capital requirements and standard business considerations may also affect the company s ability to pay dividends 
consistent with the prc s holding company order  pnm paid dividends of million to the company on december  on march   the pnm board of directors declared an additional dividend of approximately million  which was paid march  on february   the company s board of directors approved a percent increase in the common stock dividend 
the increase raises the quarterly dividend to per share  for an indicated annual dividend of per share 
the company s board of directors approved a policy for future dividend increases in the range of to percent annually  targeting a payout of between to percent of regulated earnings 
the company believes that this target is consistent with the company s expectation of future operating cash flows and the cash needs of its planned increase in generating capacity 
capital structure the company s capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  at december is shown below common equity preferred stock long term debt total capitalization total capitalization does not include as debt the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta ppa which was million as of december  and million as of december  other issues facing the company restructuring the electric utility industry in april  new mexico s electric utility industry restructuring act of the restructuring act was enacted into law 
the restructuring act opens the state s electric power market to customer choice 
in march  amendments to the restructuring act were passed which delay the original implementation dates by approximately five years  including the requirement for corporate separation of supply service and energy related service assets from distribution and transmission service assets 
in addition  the prc will have the authority to delay implementation for another year under certain circumstances 
the restructuring act  as amended  will give schools  residential and small business customers the opportunity to choose among competing power suppliers beginning in january competition would be expanded to include all customers starting in july the company is unable to predict the form its further restructuring will take under the delayed implementation of customer choice 
in addition  the restructuring act  as amended  recognizes that electric utilities should be permitted a reasonable opportunity to recover an appropriate amount of the costs previously incurred in providing electric service to their customers 
the amendments to the restructuring act required that the prc approve a holding company  subject to terms and conditions in the public interest  without corporate separation of supply service and energy related service assets from distribution and transmission service assets  by july  in addition  the amendments allow utilities to engage in unregulated power generation business activities until corporate separation is implemented 
on december   the company implemented the holding company structure without corporate separation of supply service and energy related services assets from distribution and transmission services assets 
this structure provides for a holding company whose current holdings will be pnm  avistar and other inactive unregulated subsidiaries 
this was effected through the share exchange between pnm shareholders and the holding company  pnm resources 
avistar and most of the inactive unregulated subsidiaries became wholly owned subsidiaries of the holding company in january the transfer of certain corporate related assets to the holding company also occurred in january there are no current plans to provide the holding company with significant debt financing 
the session of the new mexico legislature resulted in enactment of tax measures favorable to the construction of merchant generating plants and plants fueled by renewable resources 
the new laws provide authority for all local governments in the state to issue industrial revenue bonds for merchant generating plants smaller than mw 
the bonds provide exemptions from property taxes 
also enacted into law was a investment tax credit for merchant generating plants smaller than mw  tax credits for qualified generators using renewable resources  and an exemption from gross receipts tax for the cost of certain wind generation equipment 
there is a growing concern in new mexico about the use of water for merchant power plants  due to the increased activity in building these plants in the state  which has an arid climate 
the availability of sufficient water supplies to meet all the needs of the state  including growth  is a major issue 
it is expected that the legislature will appoint an interim committee to study the impact of power plants on the state s water and other natural resources  with a report to be issued for the session 
in building the afton and lordsburg plants  which are much smaller than other merchant plants under construction or planned by other generating companies  the company has secured sufficient water rights 
congress is currently considering a number of bills affecting the energy industry  including comprehensive energy policy legislation that addresses numerous electricity issues that are fundamental to the structure of the industry 
among the provisions being considered are granting ferc jurisdiction over currently non jurisdictional entities for transmission  granting ferc authority to require participation in regional transmission organizations rto  reliability standards  transmission pricing and siting  public utility holding company act repeal  public utility regulatory policies act repeal  net metering requirements  additional consumer protections  and renewable energy requirements 
in addition  proposed tax legislation contains provisions relating to electric industry restructuring  primarily directing the treasury department  in consultation with ferc  to conduct a study of tax issues resulting from restructuring and to report to congress annually 
the tax legislation being considered also contains provisions regarding tax credits for electricity production from renewable resources  clean coal technologies and fuel cells  as well as tax incentives for energy conservation and efficiency measures 
on march   the senate passed the economic stimulus package previously passed by the house of representatives 
the package includes an extension to the federal production tax credit until january  the president is expected to sign the package into law 
the company will continue to participate in the debate regarding national energy policy and any legislation affecting the industry 
in august  the ferc issued a series of orders requiring existing independent system operators and developing rtos in the eastern united states to enter into mediation to form a single rto in the northeast and a second in the southeast 
the ferc expressed the desire that four rto s be formed in the united states  two in the east  one in the midwest and one in the west 
the company along with other southwest transmission owners formed an rto and made a filing on october  with the ferc 
the ferc has indicated its intention to initiate a separate notice of proposed rulemaking that would require implementation of new open access transmission tariffs by rtos and by public utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities 
the new tariffs would adopt provisions to implement new transmission services and a standardized wholesale market design 
the new functions would be implemented by an independent entity  which could be an rto  that would perform services under the standard market design under rules applicable to all transmission customers 
recovery of certain costs under the restructuring act stranded costs the restructuring act  as amended  recognizes that electric utilities should be permitted a reasonable opportunity to recover an appropriate amount of the costs previously incurred in providing electric service to their customers 
these stranded costs represent all costs associated with generation related assets  currently in rates  in excess of the expected competitive market price over the life of those assets and include plant decommissioning costs  regulatory assets  and lease and lease related costs 
utilities will be allowed to recover no less than of stranded costs through a non bypassable charge on all customer bills for five years after implementation of customer choice 
the prc could authorize a utility to recover up to of its stranded costs if the prc finds that recovery of more than i is in the public interest  ii is necessary to maintain the financial integrity of the public utility  iii is necessary to continue adequate and reliable service  and iv will not cause an increase in rates to residential or small business customers during the transition period 
the restructuring act  as amended  also allows for the recovery of nuclear decommissioning costs by means of a separate wires charge over the life of the underlying generation assets see nuclear regulatory commission prefunding below 
the calculation of stranded costs is subject to a number of highly sensitive assumptions  including the date of open access  appropriate discount rates and projected market prices  among others 
the restructuring act  as amended  requires the company to file a transition plan which includes provisions for the recovery of stranded costs and other expenses associated with the transition to a competitive market no later than january  the company is unable to predict the amount of stranded costs that it may seek to recover at that time 
the company s previous proposal to recover its stranded costs under the original customer choice implementation dates would not accurately represent the company s expected stranded costs under the amended implementation dates of the restructuring act 
approximately million of costs associated with the power supply and energy services businesses under the restructuring act were established as regulatory assets 
because of the company s belief that recovery is probable  these assets continue to be classified as regulatory assets  although the company has discontinued the use of accounting for rate regulated activities 
the amendments to the restructuring act provide the opportunity for amortization of coal mine decommissioning costs currently estimated at approximately million 
the company intends to seek recovery of these costs in its next rate case filing and believes that the costs are fully recoverable 
the company believes that any remaining portion of the regulatory assets will be fully recovered in future rates  including through a non bypassable wires charge 
the company believes that the restructuring act  as amended  if properly applied  provides an opportunity for recovery of a reasonable amount of stranded costs should such costs exist at the time of separation 
if regulatory orders do not provide for a reasonable recovery  the company is prepared to vigorously pursue judicial remedies 
the prc will make a determination and quantification of stranded cost recovery prior to implementation of restructuring 
the determination may have an impact on the recoverability of the related assets and may have a material effect on the future financial results and position of the company 
transition cost recovery in addition  the restructuring act  as amended  authorizes utilities to recover in full any prudent and reasonable costs incurred in implementing full open access transition costs 
these transition costs are currently scheduled to be recovered from through by means of a separate wires charge 
the prc may extend this date by up to one year 
the company may seek to recover transition costs already incurred in future rate cases that may occur prior to open access 
the company is unable to predict the amount of transition costs it may incur 
to date  the company has capitalized million of expenditures that meet the restructuring act s definition of transition costs 
transition costs for which the company will seek recovery include professional fees  financing costs  consents relating to the transfer of assets  management information system changes including billing system changes and public and customer education and communications 
these costs will be amortized over the recovery period to match related revenues 
the company intends to vigorously pursue remedies available to it should the prc disallow recovery of reasonable transition costs 
costs not recoverable will be expensed when incurred unless these costs are otherwise permitted to be capitalized under current and future accounting rules 
depending on the amount of non recoverable transition costs  if any  the resulting charge to earnings may have a material effect on the future financial results and position of the company 
nuclear regulatory commission nrc prefunding pursuant to nrc rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants  the company has a program for funding its share of decommissioning costs for pvngs through a sinking fund mechanism 
the nrc rules on financial assurance became effective on november  the amended rules provide that a licensee may use an external sinking fund as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated decommissioning costs through cost of service rates or a non bypassable charge 
other mechanisms are prescribed  such as prepayment  surety methods  insurance and other guarantees  to the extent that the requirements for exclusive reliance on the fund mechanism are not met 
the restructuring act  as amended  allows for the recoverability of up to of stranded costs including nuclear decommissioning costs 
the results of the triannual decommissioning cost study indicated that pnm s share of the pvngs decommissioning costs excluding spent fuel disposal will be approximately million in dollars 
the restructuring act  as amended  specifically identifies nuclear decommissioning costs as eligible for separate recovery over a longer period of time than other stranded costs if the prc determines a separate recovery mechanism to be in the public interest 
in addition  the restructuring act  as amended  states that it does not require the prc to issue any order which would result in loss of eligibility to exclusively use external sinking fund methods for decommissioning obligations pursuant to federal regulations 
when final determination of stranded cost recovery is made and if the company is unable to meet the requirements of the nrc rules permitting the use of an external sinking fund because it is unable to recover all of its estimated decommissioning costs through a non bypassable charge  the company may have to pre fund or find a similarly capital intensive means to meet the nrc rules 
there can be no assurance that such an event will not negatively affect the funding of the company s growth plans 
merchant plant filing senate bill sb  enacted by the session of the new mexico legislature  allowed public utilities to invest in  construct  acquire or operate a generating plant not intended to provide retail electric service  free of certain otherwise applicable regulatory requirements contained in the public utility act 
by order entered on march   the prc found that these provisions of sb raised issues such as cost allocations for ratemaking  revenue allocations for off system sales  how the commission can ensure the utility will meet its duty to provide service when the utility invests in such generating plant  how that plant will be financed and how transactions between regulated services and merchant plants will be conducted 
the company has filed a pleading addressing these issues and testimony in response to interested parties requests 
the prc has established a schedule for the filing of staff and intervenor testimony and for the company s rebuttal testimony  culminating in a hearing scheduled for june  in november  the company began settlement negotiations with the prc s utility staff and intervenors related to these prc proceedings in order to resolve a number of matters 
in addition to the issues being examined in the company s merchant plant filing  discussions have included the future framework for restructuring the electric industry in new mexico under the restructuring act  and a future retail electric rate path 
the negotiations include the potential implementation and effective date of rates that would replace those approved under the rate freeze stipulation that remains in effect until january the company is currently unable to predict the impact these proceedings may have on its plans to expand its generating capacity and other operations 
western united states wholesale power market a significant portion of the company s earnings in was derived from the company s wholesale power trading operations  which benefited from strong demand and high wholesale prices in the western united states 
these market conditions were primarily driven by the electric power supply shortages in the western united states during the first half of the year 
as a result of the supply imbalance  the wholesale power market in the western united states became extremely volatile and  while providing many marketing opportunities  presented and continues to present significant risk to companies selling power into this marketplace 
moderate weather in california  as well as certain regulatory actions see below  have caused a significant decline in the price of wholesale electricity in the western united states wholesale power market 
in addition  conservation measures and new generation have or are expected to put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices 
as a result of these trends  the company expects its earnings from wholesale power trading operations to be significantly lower in the future than the levels seen during the last half of and the first half of the power market in the western united states has been the subject of widespread national attention 
at the heart of the situation were flaws in the california deregulation legislation and a significant imbalance between electric supply and demand 
these circumstances were aggravated by other factors such as increases in gas supply costs  weather conditions and transmission constraints 
the ferc and the california public utilities commission cpuc have entered a series of orders addressing  respectively  the wholesale pricing of electricity into the california market and the retail pricing of electricity to california consumers 
these initiatives put significant downward pressure on wholesale prices 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these governmental initiatives and their long term effect on the western united states power market or on the company s ability to market into the california market 
during  regional wholesale electricity prices reached over  per mwh mainly due to the electric power shortages in the west although current price levels are much depressed from this level 
two of california s major utilities  southern california edison company sce and pacific gas and electric co 
pg e  were unable to fully recover their wholesale power costs from their retail customers 
as a result  both utilities experienced severe liquidity constraints 
pg e decided to seek bankruptcy protection while sce was forced to consider bankruptcy 
in response to the turmoil in the california energy market  the ferc initially imposed a soft price cap of per mwh for sales to the california power exchange cal px and the california independent system operator cal iso that required any wholesale sales of electricity into these markets be capped at per mwh unless the seller could demonstrate that its costs exceeded the cap 
this price cap was effectively modified by ferc orders issued in march and april that directed certain power suppliers to provide refunds for overcharges calculated on the basis of a formula that sanctioned wholesale prices considerably in excess of the per mwh level 
on april   the ferc adopted an order establishing prospective mitigation and a monitoring plan for the california wholesale markets and which established a further investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets 
the plan reflected in the april order  replaced the per mwh soft cap previously established and applied during periods of system emergency 
thereafter  on june   the ferc issued still another order that changed the previous orders and expanded the price mitigation approach of the april order to all of the western region 
as a result of the price mitigation plan and other factors  such as moderate weather in california and lower gas prices  wholesale electric prices declined significantly by the end of the third quarter and remained low through the fourth quarter 
the company is unable to predict the impact the price mitigation plan will ultimately have on the wholesale market  but expects that if wholesale electric prices remain at current levels  future operating revenues from generation and trading will be significantly lower than in the first half of the june order also directed a ferc administrative law judge to convene a settlement conference to address potential refunds owed by sellers into the california market 
the settlement conference  in which the company participated  was ultimately unsuccessful  but the administrative law judge called in his recommendation to the ferc for an evidentiary hearing to resolve the dispute  suggesting that refunds were due  however  the estimated refunds were significantly lower than demanded by california  and in most instances  were offset by the amounts due suppliers from the cal px and cal iso 
california had demanded refunds of approximately billion from power suppliers 
on july   acting on the recommendation of the administrative law judge  the ferc ordered an expedited fact finding hearing to evaluate refunds for spot market transactions in california 
the ferc also ordered a preliminary hearing to determine whether refunds were due resulting from wholesale sales into the pacific northwest 
the pacific northwest matter was heard by an administrative law judge whose recommended decision declined to order refunds resulting from sales into the pacific northwest  but the ferc has not yet acted on this recommended decision 
the hearing on potential california refund obligations has not yet been completed and a recommended decision is not anticipated until the second half of the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these ferc proceedings  or whether the company will be directed to make any refunds as the result of a ferc order 
in  approximately million in wholesale power sales by the company were made directly to the cal px  which was the main market for the purchase and sale of electricity in the state in the beginning of  or the cal iso which manages the state s electricity transmission network 
in january and february  sce and pg e  major purchasers of power from the cal px and iso  defaulted on payments due the cal px for power purchased from the cal px in these defaults caused the cal px to seek bankruptcy protection 
the company has filed its proofs of claims in the cal px and pg e bankruptcy proceedings 
total amounts due from the cal px or cal iso for power sold to them in and total approximately million 
the company has provided allowances for the total amount due from the cal px and cal iso 
prior to its bankruptcy filing  the cal px undertook to charge back the defaults of sce and pg e to other market participants  in proportion to their participation in the markets 
the company was invoiced for million as its proportionate share under the cal px tariff 
the company  as well as a number of power marketers and generators  filed complaints with the ferc to halt the cal px s attempt to collect these payments under the charge back mechanism  claiming the mechanism was not intended for these purposes  and even if it was so intended  such an application was unreasonable and destabilizing to the california power market 
the ferc has issued a ruling on these complaints eliminating the charge back mechanism 
with the demise of the cal px in february  the california department of water resources cal dwr commenced a program of purchasing electric power needed to supply california utility customers serviced by pg e and sce as these utilities lacked the liquidity to purchase supplies 
the purchases were financed by legislative appropriation  with the expectation that this funding would be replaced with the issuance of revenue bonds by the state 
in the first quarter of  the company began to sell power to the cal dwr 
the company has regularly monitored its credit risk with regard to its cal dwr sales and believes its exposure is prudent 
in addition to sales directly to california  the company sells power to customers in other jurisdictions who sell to california and whose ability to pay the company may be dependent on payment from california 
the company is unable to determine whether its non california power sales ultimately are resold in the california market 
the company s credit risk is monitored by its risk management committee  which is comprised of senior finance and operations managers 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure through established credit limits  a diversified customer base and the structuring of transactions to take advantage of off setting positions with its customers 
to the extent these customers who sell power into california are dependent on payment from california to make their payments to the company  the company may be exposed to credit risk which did not exist prior to the california situation 
in  in response to the increased credit risk and market price volatility described above  the company provided an additional allowance against revenue of million for anticipated losses to reflect management s estimate of the increased market and credit risk in the wholesale power market and its impact on revenues 
based on information available at december   the company believes the total allowance for anticipated losses  currently established at million  is adequate for management s estimate of potential uncollectible accounts 
the company will continue to monitor the wholesale power marketplace and adjust its estimates accordingly 
the cpuc has commenced an investigation into the functioning of the california wholesale power market and its associated impact on retail rates 
the company  along with other power suppliers in california  has been served with a subpoena in connection with this investigation and has responded to the subpoena 
the company has been advised that the california attorney general is conducting an investigation into possibly unlawful  unfair or anti competitive behavior affecting electricity rates in california  and that company documents will be subpoenaed in the future in connection with this investigation 
the california attorney general has filed a lawsuit against certain power marketers for alleged unfair trade practices involving the reselling of reserved capacity 
the company is not one of the named defendants 
other related investigations have been commenced by other federal and state governmental bodies 
in addition  there are several class action lawsuits that have been filed in california against generators and wholesale sellers of energy into the california market 
these actions allege  in essence  that the defendants engaged in unlawful and unfair business practices to manipulate the wholesale energy market  fix prices and restrain supply  and thereby drive up prices 
the company is not a named defendant in any of these actions 
the company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position 
as noted above  sce has been forced to consider a bankruptcy filing 
however  at the present time such a bankruptcy filing does not appear likely  given the understanding that sce has refinanced a significant portion of its outstanding debt and cured many previously existing payment defaults under its debt agreements and also with the cal px and other suppliers 
sce is a participant in pvngs and a participant in four corners 
pursuant to an agreement among the participants in pvngs and an agreement among the participants in four corners units and  each participant is required to fund its proportionate share of operation and maintenance  capital  and fuel costs of pvngs and four corners units and the company estimates sce s total monthly share of these costs to be approximately million for pvngs and million for four corners 
the agreements provide that if a participant fails to meet its payment obligations  each non defaulting participant shall pay its proportionate share of the payments owed by the defaulting participant for a period of six months 
during this time the defaulting participant is entitled to its share of the power generated by the respective station 
after this grace period  the defaulting participant must make its payments in arrears before it is entitled to its continuing share of power 
sce has not defaulted on its payment obligations with respect to pvngs and four corners 
termination of western resources transaction on november   pnm and western resources announced that both companies boards of directors approved an agreement under which pnm would acquire the western resources electric utility operations in a tax free  stock for stock transaction 
the agreement required that western resources split off its non utility businesses to its shareholders prior to closing 
in july  the kcc issued two orders 
the first order declared the split off required by the agreement to be unlawful as designed  with or without a merger 
the second order decreased rates for western resources  despite a request for a million increase 
after rehearing the kcc established the rate decrease at million 
on october   the kcc issued an order on reconsideration reaffirming its decision that the split off as designed in the agreement was unlawful with or without a merger 
because of these rulings  the company announced that it believed the agreement as originally structured could not be consummated 
efforts to renegotiate the transaction failed 
western resources demanded that the company file for regulatory approvals of the transaction as designed  despite the fact that the transaction required the split off already determined to be unlawful by the kcc 
as a result of the disagreement over the viability of the transaction as designed  the company filed suit on october   in new york state court seeking declarations that the transaction could not be accomplished as designed due to the kcc s determination that the split off condition of the transaction is unlawful  that the company is not obligated to pursue approvals of the transaction as designed  that the transaction is terminated effective december   without an automatic extension  and that the kcc rate case order constitutes a material adverse effect under the agreement 
the company also seeks monetary damages for breach of contract because western resources represented and warranted that the split off did not require approval of the kcc 
on november   western resources filed a complaint against the company in new york state court alleging breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
western resources alleged that the company brought about the kcc orders  failed to assist in efforts to reverse the kcc orders  refused to renegotiate within the terms of the agreement  interfered with western resources efforts to satisfy the terms of the agreement  and effected an unauthorized de facto termination of the agreement by filing its complaint 
western resources alleges damages in excess of million 
the company believes that the complaint filed by western resources is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the complaint 
the company also intends to vigorously pursue its own complaint 
on january   the company notified western resources that it had taken action to terminate the agreement as of that date 
the company identified numerous breaches of the agreement by western resources and the regulatory rulings in kansas as reasons for the termination 
on january   western resources responded that it considered the company s termination to be ineffective and the agreement to still be in effect 
on february   the district court for shawnee county  kansas  dismissed without prejudice western resources petition for judicial review of the kcc s split off orders 
the court ruled that by filing a new financial plan in compliance with the orders  western resources accepted certain portions of the orders thereby creating a situation where further administrative action became necessary 
as a result  the court concluded that the matter was not ripe for judicial review and remanded the case to the kcc 
on march   the kansas court of appeals affirmed the kcc s rate order 
the company is currently unable to predict the outcome of its litigation with western resources 
implementation of new customer billing system on november   the company implemented a new customer billing system 
due to a significant number of problems associated with the implementation of the new billing system  the company was unable to generate appropriate bills for all its customers through the first quarter of and was unable to analyze delinquent accounts until november as a result of the delay of normal collection activities  the company incurred a significant increase in delinquent accounts  many of which occurred with customers that no longer have active accounts with the company 
as a result  the company significantly increased its estimated bad debt costs throughout and the company continued its analysis and collection efforts of its delinquent accounts resulting from the problems associated with the implementation of the new customer billing system throughout and identified additional bad debt exposure 
by the end of  the company completed its analysis of its delinquent accounts and resumed its normal collection procedures 
based upon information available at december   the company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts of million is adequate for management s estimate of potential uncollectible accounts 
the following is a summary of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the utility operations which utilizes the customer billing system during  and in thousands allowance for doubtful accounts  beginning of year   bad debt expense    less write off adjustments of uncollectible accounts 
  allowance for doubtful accounts  end of year    note above schedule excludes bad debt allowance for the generation and trading operations effects of certain events on future revenues the company s mw power sale contract with san diego gas and electric company sdg e expired on april  following ferc s acceptance for filing of a cancellation notice filed by the company 
the company expects to replace these revenues  based on current market conditions 
in addition  previously reported litigation between the company and sdg e regarding prior years contract pricing has been resolved in the company s favor 
on october   western area power administration wapa filed a petition at the ferc requesting the ferc  on an expedited basis  to order the company to provide network transmission service to wapa under the company s open access transmission tariff on behalf of the united states department of energy doe as contracting agent for kirtland air force base kafb 
in  ferc issued a proposed order directing the company to provide transmission service  but left the terms of service to be negotiated by the parties and subject to final ferc review and determination 
in january  the parties submitted a settlement agreement resolving most of the issues relating to the rates  terms and conditions of service 
the proposed ferc order is not subject to requests for rehearing or judicial review 
an order establishing terms and conditions including compensation for transmission service would be a final order that would be subject to requests for rehearing and to judicial review 
the company is evaluating its legal options in relation to the proposed order or any resulting final order 
the settlement agreement reserves the company s rights to seek rehearing and judicial review of any final order and to present other legal claims 
in february  the ferc administrative law judge who supervised the negotiations leading to the partial settlement recommended that ferc issue a final order approving the agreement 
a related prc proceeding has been stayed  pending the outcome of the ferc case 
the effect of the ferc s proposed order to provide transmission service  instead of the current retail sale that the company makes to doe on behalf of kafb  depends upon the final terms of any ferc order as well as the company s ability to sell the power to a different customer and the price that the company would obtain if it makes such a sale 
the company believes that the impact will be immaterial based on the facts above 
coal fuel supply in  the company was notified by san juan coal company sjcc that the navajo nation proposed to select certain properties within the san juan and la plata mines the mining properties pursuant to the navajo hopi land settlement act of the act 
the mining properties are operated by sjcc under leases from the blm and comprise a portion of the fuel supply for the sjgs 
on november   an administrative order was issued denying the proposed selections 
the company is monitoring an appeal by the navajo nation and other developments on this issue and will continue to assess  but cannot estimate with any certainty the potential impacts to the sjgs and the company s operations 
new source review rules the united states environmental protection agency epa has proposed changes to its new source review nsr rules that could result in many actions at power plants that have previously been considered routine repair and maintenance activities and hence not subject to the application of nsr requirements as now being subject to nsr 
in november  the department of justice at the request of the epa filed complaints against seven companies alleging the companies over the past years had made modifications to their plants in violation of the nsr requirements  and in some cases the new source performance standards nsps regulations 
whether or not the epa will prevail is unclear at this time 
the epa has reached a settlement with one of the companies sued by the justice department 
discovery continues in the pending litigation 
no complaint has been filed against the company  and the company believes that all of the routine maintenance  repair  and replacement work undertaken at its power plants was and continues to be in accordance with the requirements of nsr and nsps 
however  by letter dated october   the new mexico environment department nmed made an information request of the company  advising the company that the nmed was in the process of assisting the epa in the epa s nationwide effort of verifying that changes made at the country s utilities have not inadvertently triggered a modification under the clean air act s prevention of significant determination psd policies 
the company has responded to the nmed information request 
the nature and cost of the impacts of epa s changed interpretation of the application of the nsr and nsps  together with proposed changes to these regulations  may be significant to the power production industry 
however  the company cannot quantify these impacts with regard to its power plants 
it is also not yet known what changes in epa policy  if any  may occur in the nsr area as a result of the change in administration in washington 
the national energy policy released may by the national energy policy development group  called for a review of the pending nsr enforcement actions and that review continues by the epa 
if the epa should prevail with its current interpretation of the nsr and nsps rules  the company may be required to make significant capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
threatened citizen suit under the clean air act by letter dated january   counsel for the grand canyon trust and sierra club collectively  gct notified the company of gct s intent to file a so called citizen suit under the clean air act  alleging that the company and co owners of the sjgs violated the clean air act  and the implementing federal and state regulations  at sjgs 
the notice indicates that penalties and injunctive relief may be sought 
under the clean air act  gct must wait at least days after affording the company notice ie  until march  before filing a lawsuit 
the allegations contained in gct s notice of intent to sue fall into three categories 
first  gct contends that the plant has violated  and is currently in violation  of the federal nsps at all four units at sjgs 
second  gct argues that the plant has violated  and is currently in violation  of the federal psd rules  as well as the corresponding provisions of the new mexico administrative code  at all four units 
third  gct alleges that the plant has regularly violated the opacity limit contained in sjgs s operating permit and set forth in federal and state regulations at units  and the company is currently investigating the allegations contained in the notice of intent to sue 
based on its investigation to date  the company firmly believes that the allegations are without merit 
by letter to gct s counsel dated february   the company vigorously disputed the allegations and affirmed its compliance with the laws in question 
the company adheres to high environmental standards as evidenced by its international standards organization ratings 
in that letter  the company also stated that the gct has failed to provide sufficient information to permit full examination of the allegations 
if a lawsuit is filed by gct  as threatened  the company will respond on behalf of the co owners and vigorously defend in the litigation 
the company is  however  unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the matter 
natural gas explosion on april   a natural gas explosion occurred in santa fe  new mexico 
the apparent cause of the explosion was a leak from a company line near the location 
the explosion destroyed a small building and injured two persons who were working in the building 
the company s investigation indicates that the leak was an isolated incident likely caused by a combination of corrosion and increased pressure 
the company also is cooperating with an investigation of the incident by the prc s pipeline safety bureau which issued its report on march  the bureau s report gives pnm notice of possible violations of the new mexico pipeline safety act and related regulations 
two lawsuits against the company by the injured persons along with several claims for property and business interruption damages have been resolved by the company 
at this time  the company is unable to estimate the potential liability  if any  that the company may incur as a result of the pipeline safety bureau s investigation 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position of the company 
navajo nation tax issues arizona public service company aps  the operating agent for four corners  has informed the company that in march  aps initiated discussions with the navajo nation regarding various tax issues in conjunction with the expiration of a tax waiver  in july  which was granted by the navajo nation in the tax waiver pertains to the possessory interest tax and the business activity tax associated with the four corners operations on the reservation 
the company believes that the resolution of these tax issues will require an extended process and could potentially affect the cost of conducting business activities on the reservation 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of discussions with the navajo nation regarding these tax issues and cannot estimate with any certainty the potential impact on the company s operations

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas the statement requires the recognition of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that result from the acquisition  construction or development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation is required to be recognized at its fair value when incurred 
the cost of the asset retirement obligation is required to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
this cost must be expensed using a systematic and rational method over the related asset s useful life 
sfas is effective for the company beginning january  the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas and is unable to predict its impact on the company s operating results and financial position at this time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk as it relates to changes in natural gas and electric prices  changes in interest rates and  historically  adverse market changes for investments held by the company s various trusts 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments for bulk power electricity trading purposes in order to take advantage of favorable price movements and market timing activities in the wholesale power markets 
information about the company s financial instruments is set forth in critical accounting policies section of management s discussion of results of operations and financial condition and the financial instruments note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and incorporated by reference 
the following additional information is provided 
risk management the company controls the scope of its various forms of risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures and oversight by senior level management and the board of directors 
the company s finance committee of the board of directors sets the risk limit parameters 
an internal risk management committee rmc  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  oversees all of the activities  which include commodity price  credit  equity  interest rate and business risks 
the rmc has oversight for the ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the risk control organization and policies 
the company has a risk control organization  headed by the director of financial risk management risk manager  which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions  on an enterprise wide basis 
the rmc s responsibilities specifically include establishment of a general policy regarding risk exposure levels and activities in each of the business units  recommendation of the types of instruments permitted for trading  authority to establish a general policy regarding counterparty exposure and limits  authorization and delegation of trading transaction limits for trading activities  review and approval of controls and procedures for the trading activities  review and approval of models and assumptions used to calculate mark to market and risk exposure  authority to approve and open brokerage and counterparty accounts for derivative trading  review for trading and risk activities  and quarterly reporting to the finance committee and the board of directors on these activities 
the rmc also proposes value at risk var limits to the finance committee 
the finance committee ultimately sets the aggregate var limit 
it is the responsibility of each business unit to create its own control and procedures policy for trading within the parameters established by the finance committee 
the rmc reviews and approves these policies  which are created with the assistance of the chief accounting officer  director of internal audit and the risk manager 
each business units policies address the following controls authorized risk exposure limits  authorized trading instruments and markets  authorized traders  policies on segregation of duties  policies on marking to market  responsibilities for trade capture  confirmation procedures  responsibilities for reporting results  statement on the role of derivatives trading  and limits on individual transaction size nominal value for traders 
to the extent an open position exists  fluctuating commodity prices can impact financial results and financial position  either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  the company cannot predict with precision the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses  operating results or financial position 
commodity risk trading and marketing operations often involve market risks associated with managing energy commodities and establishing open positions in the energy markets  primarily on a short term basis 
these risks fall into three different categories price and volume volatility  credit risk of trading counterparties and adequacy of the control environment for trading 
the company routinely enters into forward contracts and options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements and to minimize the risk of market fluctuations on the generation and trading operations 
the company s wholesale power marketing operations  including both firm commitments and trading activities  are managed through an asset backed strategy  whereby the company s aggregate net open position is covered by its own excess generation capabilities 
the company is exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were disrupted or if its jurisdictional load requirements were greater than anticipated 
if the company were required to cover all or a portion of its net open contract position  it would have to meet its commitments through market purchases 
the company assesses the risk of these derivatives using the var method  in order to maintain the company s total exposure within management prescribed limits 
the company utilizes the variance covariance model of var  which is a probabilistic model that measures the risk of loss to earnings in market sensitive instruments 
the variance covariance model relies on statistical relationships to analyze how changes in different markets can affect a portfolio of instruments with different characteristics and market exposure 
var models are relatively sophisticated  however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being evaluated may trigger a potential loss in excess of calculated amounts if changes in commodity prices exceed the confidence level of the model used 
the var methodology employs the following critical parameters volatility estimates  market values of open positions  appropriate market oriented holding periods and seasonally adjusted correlation estimates 
the company uses a holding period of three days as the estimate of the length of time that will be needed to liquidate the positions 
the volatility and the correlation estimates measure the impact of adverse price movements both at an individual position level as well as at the total portfolio level 
the confidence level established is 
for example  if var is calculated at million  it is estimated at a confidence level that if prices move against the company s positions  the company s pre tax gain or loss in liquidating the portfolio would not exceed million in the three days that it would take to liquidate the portfolio 
the company accounts for the sale of its electric generation in excess of its jurisdictional needs or the purchase of jurisdictional needs as non trading 
non jurisdictional purchases for resale and subsequent resales are accounted for as energy trading contracts 
with respect to the company s trading portfolio  the var was million 
the company calculates a portfolio var which in addition to its trading portfolio includes all non trading designated contracts  its generation assets excluded from jurisdictional rates and any excess jurisdictional capacity 
this excess is determined using average peak forecasts for the respective block of power in the forward market 
the company s portfolio var was million at december  the company s var is regularly monitored by the company s rmc 
the rmc has put in place procedures to ensure that increases in var are reviewed and  if deemed necessary  acted upon to reduce exposures 
the var represents an estimate of the potential gains or losses that could be recognized on the company s wholesale power marketing portfolio given current volatility in the market  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  as well as changes to the company s wholesale power marketing portfolio during the year 
in addition  the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment by counterparties 
the company uses a credit management process to access and monitor the financial conditions of counterparties 
credit exposure is also regularly monitored by the rmc 
the company provides for losses due to market and credit risk 
the company s credit risk with its largest counterparty as of december  and was million and million respectively 
the company hedges certain portions of natural gas supply contracts in order to protect its jurisdictional customers from adverse price fluctuations in the natural gas market 
the financial impact of all hedge gains and losses  including the related costs of the program  is recoverable through the company s purchased gas adjustment clause as deemed prudently incurred by the prc 
as a result  earnings are not affected by gains and losses generated by these instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   the company has an investment portfolio of fixed rate government obligations and corporate securities which is subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
for accounting purposes  the portfolio is classified as available for sale and is marked to market 
as a result  unrealized losses resulting from interest rate increases are recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
if interest rates were to rise  basis points from their levels at december   the fair value of these instruments would decline by or million 
in addition  because of this interest rate sensitivity  early or unplanned redemption of these investments in a period of increasing interest rates would subject the company to risk of a realized loss of principal as the fair market value of these investments would be less than their carrying value 
the company employs investment managers to mitigate this risk 
as part of its investing strategies  the company has diversified its portfolio with investments of varying maturity  obligors and limits credit exposure to high investment grade quality investments 
the company has long term debt which subjects it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
all of the company s long term debt is fixed rate debt  and therefore  does not expose the company s earnings to a risk of loss due to adverse changes in market interest rates
