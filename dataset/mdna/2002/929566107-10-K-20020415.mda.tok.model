overview in  the demand for new trailers in the united states declined substantially resulting in an industry decline of in new production from  units in to  units in this decline resulted from overall economic conditions in the us economy  which reduced the level of freight tonnage shipped in  and ongoing challenges in the motor carrier industry principally caused by high fuel prices and lower revenues per mile due to intense competition for shipments 
the company s market share declined slightly to during the company s backlog declined from million as of december  to million as of december  this significant reduction in demand along with historical manufacturing over capacity in the truck trailer industry resulted in significant losses being reported by the industry as a whole 
further impacting the company was a significant decline in the demand for used trailers caused by the general economic and industry conditions previously discussed and the company s excess supply of used trailers 
the company s supply of used trailers comes from accepting trade ins of used trailers from its customers upon the sale of new trailers 
the excess supply of used trailers was further impacted by the company s backlog of new trailer orders totaling million at december   in which the company had previously agreed upon the pricing terms for the new trailers and the trade in allowance for the used trailers

effective january   this standard sets forth a single accounting model for the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the effect  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company has exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and virgin plastic pellets 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company manages aluminum and virgin plastic pellets price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with its suppliers prior to a customer sales order being finalized 
because the company typically does not set prices for its products in advance of its commodity purchases  it can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting its prices for each order 
to the extent that the company is unable to offset the increased commodity costs in its product prices  the company s results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   the company had approximately million of london interbank rate libor based debt outstanding under its bank line of credit  million of outstanding borrowings under its canadian revolving line of credit and million of proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization facility  which also requires libor based interest payments 
a hypothetical approximately million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates the company has historically entered into foreign currency forward contracts principally against the german deutschemark and french franc to hedge the net receivable payable position arising from trade sales including lease revenues and purchases with regard to the company s international activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
