sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract and provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast region and metro d 
c 
we typically obtain an additional to down payment due to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits the customer to cancel his obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution 
residential land inventory it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described under business and properties residential development activities  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable lots in communities under development are included in the  total home lots under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the book value of  is identified on the balance sheet as inventories land  land options  and cost of projects in planning  and does not include inventory in poland amounting to in our northeast region  our objective is to control a supply of land sufficient to meet anticipated building requirements for at least three to five years 
we typically option parcels of unimproved land for development 
in north carolina  metro dc  and the mid south  a portion of the land we acquired was from land developers on a lot takedown basis 
in texas  we primarily acquire improved lots from land developers 
under a typical agreement with the lot developer  we purchase a minimal number of lots 
the balance of the lots to be purchased are covered under an option agreement or a non recourse purchase agreement 
due to the dwindling supply of improved lots in these markets  we are currently optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
in california  historically we have focused our development efforts in the southern portion of the state 
where possible  we plan to option developed or partially developed lots 
with a limited supply of developed lots in california  we are currently optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
customer financing at our communities  on site personnel facilitate sales by offering to arrange financing for prospective customers through our mortgage subsidiaries 
we believe that the ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales 
our business consists of providing our customers with competitive financing and coordinating and expediting the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application  loan approval and closing 
we originate loans in new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  north carolina  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  texas  and california 
like other mortgage bankers  we customarily sell nearly all of the loans that we originate 
additionally  we sell virtually all of the loan servicing rights to loans we originate 
loans are sold either individually or in pools to gnma  fnma  or fhlmc or against forward commitments to institutional investors  including banks  mortgage banking firms  and savings and loan associations 
we plan to grow our mortgage banking operations 
our objective is to increase the capture rate of non cash homebuyers from the rate achieved in fiscal to over the next several years 
competition our residential business is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition range from small local builders to larger regional and national builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters general 
we are subject to various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
environmental 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas 
fair housing act 
in july  new jersey adopted the fair housing act which established an administrative agency to adopt criteria by which municipalities will determine and provide for their fair share of low and moderate income housing 
this agency adopted such criteria in may its implementation thus far has caused some delay in approvals for some of our new jersey communities and may result in a reduction in the number of homes planned for some properties 
both prior to the enactment of the fair housing act and in its implementation thus far  municipal approvals in some of the new jersey municipalities in which we own land or land options required us to set aside up to of the approved homes for sale at prices affordable to persons of low and moderate income 
in order to comply with such requirements  we must sell these homes at a loss 
we attempt to reduce some of these losses through increased density  certain cost saving construction measures and reduced land prices from the sellers of property 
such losses are absorbed by the market priced homes in the same developments 
state planning act 
pursuant to the state planning act  the new jersey state planning commission has adopted a state development and redevelopment plan state plan 
the state plan  if fully implemented  would designate large portions of the state as unavailable for development or as available for development only at low densities  and other portions of the state for more intense development 
state government agencies would be required to make permitting decisions in accordance with the state plan  if it is fully implemented 
the state government agencies have not yet adopted policies and regulations to fully implement the state plan 
the governor has issued an executive order to all state agencies requiring compliance with the state plan 
it is unclear what effect this executive order may have on our ability to develop our land 
the california environmental quality act ceqa requires that every community comply with the ceqa 
compliance with ceqa may result in delay in obtaining the necessary approvals for commencement of the community  a reduction in the density permitted in the community  additional costs in developing the community  or denial of the permits necessary to construct the community 
conclusion 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  it can be anticipated that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application

the following table sets forth the ratios of earnings to fixed charges and earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends for the periods indicated years ended october  ratio of earnings to fixed charges a ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends a a no ratio is presented for the year ended october  as the earnings for such period were insufficient to cover fixed charges by  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  seasonal increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the repurchase of common stock  and the merger with washington homes  inc we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  financial service revenues  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  impairment losses and goodwill amortization 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal and  inventory levels increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as inventory levels increase 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels 
as our mortgage warehouse loan asset increases  cash flow from operations decreases 
conversely  as such loans decrease  cash flow from operations increases 
depreciation and impairment losses always increase cash flow from operating activities since they are non cash charges to operations 
we expect to be in an expansion mode in fiscal as a result  we expect cash flow from operations to be less than net income in fiscal on december   our stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock expired 
as of december    shares had been purchased under this program 
on july   our board of directors authorized a revision to our stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october    have been purchased under this program 
our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to a revolving credit agreement the agreement that provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of up to  through july interest is payable monthly and at various rates of either the prime rate plus 
or libor plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
as of october   borrowings under the agreement were zero 
the subordinated indebtedness issued by us and outstanding as of october  was  subordinated notes due june in april  we retired  of these subordinated notes 
on october   we issued  senior notes due october the proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
on may   we issued  senior notes due april we believe that we will be able either to repay the subordinated indebtedness and senior notes at their respective maturity dates through cash flows generated from operations or through subsequent debt issuances 
our mortgage banking subsidiary borrows under a  bank warehousing arrangement which expires in july interest is payable monthly at the federal funds rate plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend this agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
other finance subsidiaries formerly borrowed from a multi builder owned financial corporation and a builder owned financial corporation to finance mortgage backed securities but in fiscal decided to cease further borrowing from multi builder and builder owned financial corporations 
these non recourse borrowings have been generally secured by mortgage loans originated by one of our subsidiaries 
as of october   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such borrowings was total inventory increased  from october  to october  this increase was primarily due to the merger with washington homes  inc and significant land purchases in the northeast region 
in addition  inventory increased in most of our other markets except in california where inventory decreased due to strong home deliveries 
substantially  all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most inventory completed or under development is financed through our revolving credit facility  senior notes  and subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of a small option fee and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these writedowns and write offs were incurred primarily because of lower property values  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property  or the decision not to exercise an option to purchase land 
during the years ended october  and  we wrote off residential land options including approval and engineering costs amounting to and million  respectively 
we did not exercise those options because the communities proforma profitability did not produce adequate returns on investment commensurate with the risk 
those communities were located in new jersey  new york  metro d 
c  north carolina  and california 
during the year ended october   we wrote down two residential communities in the northeast region  one community in north carolina  and two land parcels in florida 
the writedown in the northeast region was attributed to two communities that were part of a large land acquisition  which resulted in a loss 
the writedowns in north carolina and florida were based upon changes in market conditions 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
during the year ended october  we wrote off one residential land option including approval and engineering costs amounting to million 
we did not exercise this option because the community s proforma profitability did not produce an adequate return on investment commensurate with the risk 
in addition  we wrote down one land parcel in florida  one residential community in new york and two residential communities in north carolina 
the florida land parcel was written down based on recent purchase offers 
the communities were written down based on our decision to discontinue selling homes and offer the remaining lots for sale 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
cost of sales includes expenses for housing and land and lot sales 
a breakout of such expenses for housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended october october october dollars in thousands sale of homes    cost of sales    housing gross margin    gross margin percentage cost of sales expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues are presented below year ended october october october sale of homes cost of sales housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales gross margin percentage we sell a variety of home types in various local communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage decreased from the previous year 
this decrease was due to the washington homes  inc merger  which significantly increased our activity in metro d 
c 
and north carolina and added markets in the mid south region that collectively have a lower average sales price and gross margin than the averages for our other markets 
on an individual market basis all of our markets showed an increase in gross margin primarily resulting from increased sales prices 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage decreased from the previous year 
this decrease was primarily attributed to a full year of operations from our texas division where they report lower margins acquired in october 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage increased from the previous year 
this can be attributed to higher gross margins being achieved in each of our markets 
the dollar increases for each of the three years ended october    and was attributed to increased sales  primarily resulting from the acquisition of washington homes in and the texas division at the end of selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased to for the year ended october  and increased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  the dollar amount of selling and general expenses has increased the last two years to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  which increased from million for the previous year 
the percentage decrease during the year ended october  was due to increased deliveries and the in market merger with washington homes  inc  which resulted in administrative efficiencies 
the percentage increase in was primarily attributable to a full year of operations from our texas division and increases in the number of active selling communities in california 
the percentage increase in was attributable to increases in all our markets but primarily due to fewer deliveries in our northeast region and due to northeast region and california administrative cost increases 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales  interest income  contract deposit forfeitures  cash discounts  and corporate owned life insurance benefits 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended october october october in thousands land and lot sales    cost of sales    land and lot sales gross margin  land and lot sales are incidental to our residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
year ended october land and lot sales gross margin includes a legal settlement in california amounting to  financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the year ended october   financial services provided a million pretax profit 
during the years ended and  financial services resulted in million loss and a million profit  respectively  before income taxes 
the increase from to was primarily due to a change in management  reduced costs  increased mortgage loan amounts  and the addition of a mortgage operation from the merger with washington homes 
in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
our mortgage banking goals are to improve profitability by increasing the capture rate of our homebuyers to 
most servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses includes the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the percentage decrease during the year ended october  was due to increased housing revenues 
the decrease in fiscal year was due to increased housing revenues and the adoption of sop  accounting for the cost of computer software development for or obtained for internal use 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
our long term improvement initiatives include total quality  process redesign net of capitalized expenses  and training 
such initiatives resulted in additional expenses for the years ended october    and which were not capitalized amounting to million  million  and million  respectively 
interest interest expense includes housing  and land and lot interest 
interest expense is broken down as follows year ended october october october in thousands sale of homes    land and lot sales  total    housing interest as a percentage of sale of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous senior residential rental operations  amortization of senior and subordinated note issuance expenses  amortization of goodwill  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  corporate owned life insurance loan interest  reserves for bad debts  and contributions to a foundation for victims of the september  world trade center attack 
restructuring charges restructurig charges are estimated expenses associated with the integration of our operations with those of washington homes  inc these expenses are salaries  severance and outplacement costs for the termination of associates and costs to close and relocate existing administrative offices  and lost rent and leasehold improvements 
at october   million has been charged against the million accrual for termination and related costs while million has been charged against the million accrual established for closing and relocation costs 
total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the increased percentage is due primarily to higher amounts of expenses in not deductible for federal taxes and a reduced effect of our senior rental tax credits 
although the credits are the same in and  they reduce our effective tax rate less when pretax profits are higher 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if for some reason the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years to recover the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management is confident such deferred tax assets are recoverable regardless of future income 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
extraordinary loss on june   we redeemed  of our outstanding subordinated notes due at an average price of of par which resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that is completed after june  we adopted sfas no 
for all future acquisitions 
sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization of goodwill included in other expenses will also no longer be recorded upon adoption of the new rules 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we adopted sfas on november  upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill amortization of  which was incurred in will no longer be incurred in the future 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of our company 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
it also supersedes the accounting and reporting of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the events and transactions related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of our company 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in increasing sales prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant inflationary risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising housing costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which we sell homes  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on us because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales 
merger with washington homes  inc on january  we merged with washington homes  inc for a total purchase price of million  of which was paid in cash and  shares of our class a common stock valued at million were issued and options issued to washington homes  inc employees with an intrinsic value of million were converted to  of our options 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of our merger with washington homes  inc 
the merger with washington homes  inc did not result in a new segment 
acquisition of a california homebuilder on january  we acquired certain homebuilding assets and assumed related liabilities from the forecast group  lp tfg for an estimated purchase price of million plus the assumption of debt net of cash acquired 
the final purchase price is subject to adjustment based on financial performance through january  under the terms of the agreement the partners in tfg received million of hovnanian restricted class a common stock and the balance in cash 
to fund the acquisition we are planning to raise million through a five year term loan 
we believe our line of credit is adequate to provide working capital for our new tfg operations 
the addition of the tfg operations for almost months of fiscal is expected to add approximately per share to our net earnings 
we expect total revenues to increase more than in fiscal from levels  largely as a result of the purchase of the tfg operations
