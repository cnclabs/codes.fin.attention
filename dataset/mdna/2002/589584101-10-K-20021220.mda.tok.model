item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future trends life sciences during fiscal  meridian will open its cgmp protein production laboratory for business  creating the opportunity to serve as an enabler in the development of new drugs and vaccines 
although the cgmp protein production laboratory is a new line of business for meridian  it is an extension of meridian s existing antigen manufacturing technologies and capabilities 
the new line of business will create a new class of customers  pharmaceutical companies  as well as the opportunity to leverage sales and marketing resources 
sales and marketing resources at meridian s viral antigens and biodesign subsidiaries are being aligned to focus on common customers and complimentary products 
meridian also expects to develop or license unique biological tools and technology 
meridian expects to have its first customer for the cgmp protein production laboratory in the second quarter of fiscal meridian expects to begin reporting life sciences as a new operating segment beginning in fiscal european markets meridian has experienced sales declines of in fiscal and in fiscal in its mbe operating segment 
competitive factors and government reimbursement policies have slowed growth in european markets and sales have also been negatively affected by currency translation 
in response to market conditions  meridian restructured its european distribution operations in fiscal and by moving the export business from germany to belgium  and moving the german in country business to an independent distributor this latter move also affected sales because meridian is no longer selling to end user customers on a direct basis in germany 
although this restructuring has improved overall operating results for the mbe operating segment by lowering its cost structure  for fiscal and  there were decreases in sales as described above 
meridian believes that sales levels have at least stabilized  and in fact  believes a modest increase is attainable for fiscal us markets consolidation of the us healthcare industry is expected to continue and potentially affect meridian s customers 
industry consolidation puts pressure on pricing and aggregates buying power 
in response  in the last four years  meridian has entered into  extended or renewed several exclusive multiple year contracts with consolidated healthcare providers and supply agreements with major reference laboratories 
research and development meridian believes that internally developed products will continue to be a critical source of sales and sales growth 
research and development efforts are expected to focus on the development of new products and product improvements where meridian has a dominant market position  or its intellectual property is protected by patents or licenses

meridian s premier toxins a b and premier platinum hpsa led the volume growth for these two disease states 
both of these products were developed by meridian and launched in and  respectively 
in addition  sales of antigen products experienced strong volume growth  led by rubella antigen 
for the mbe operating segment  the decline in sales during fiscal is net of currency translation gains of  it reflects volume declines attributable to continued deterioration in market conditions in germany  as well as price erosion and volume declines related to competition for certain products in italy and other european markets 
in addition  upon changeover to an independent distributor in germany in the second quarter of fiscal  the new distributor placed stocking orders that did not repeat in fiscal for both operating segments combined  international sales were  or of total sales  for fiscal  compared to  or of total sales  in fiscal domestic mbi exports were  for fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the remaining international sales were generated by meridian s european distribution businesses mbe

excluding the effects of the inventory impairment charge  gross profit margin for fiscal was 
meridian s overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  antigens and proficiency tests 
on a quarterly basis  product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points 
operating expenses operating expenses declined  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses for fiscal included  related to the abandoned acquisition of biotrin holdings

volume declines in the traditional meridian core business were offset by the vai acquisition  which contributed sales of  for the mbe operating segment  the decline in sales during fiscal reflects the unfavorable impact of currency translation losses  and volume declines attributable to discontinuing the manufacturing and distribution of the products discussed above 
the premier platinum hpsa product had strong volume growth in the italian market  offsetting a portion of the volume declines 
for both operating segments combined  international sales were  or of total sales  for fiscal  compared to  or of total sales  in fiscal domestic mbi exports were  for fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the remaining international sales were generated by meridian s european distribution businesses mbe 
gross profit gross profit  including the effects of the inventory write off of  decreased  or  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the  inventory write off accounts for seven points of this decrease 
the remaining decrease of eight points is primarily attributable to the cincinnati manufacturing output inefficiencies  including unusual scrap levels and currency translation losses 
meridian s manufacturing costs are predominantly incurred in us dollars whereas a significant portion of international sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  a significant portion of the currency translation losses discussed under net sales above  adversely affected gross profit margins

other expense  net in fiscal includes a gain of  from the sale of the former gull laboratories headquarters facility and currency losses of  related to intercompany debt transactions involving the german distribution operation that was shut down 
income taxes the effective rate for income tax credits is in fiscal  compared to an effective rate of in fiscal the effective rate in fiscal reflects the unfavorable effect of certain permanent differences  primarily goodwill amortization and the goodwill portion of the asset impairment charge  as well as the charge for acquired in process research and development 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal also includes benefits for operating losses in us jurisdictions based on expectations of taxable income in future periods 
the effective rate in fiscal includes the tax benefits related to the write off of meridian s net investment in its german distribution business  and valuation allowance provisions related to net operating losses in europe liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis meridian s operating cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets and consideration of acquisition plans 
meridian has historically maintained line of credit availability to respond to acquisition opportunities quickly 
net cash provided by operating activities increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to earning levels  net of changes in deferred taxes  and also reflects cash used to return finished goods inventories to targeted levels 
although fiscal reflected a significant loss caused by asset impairment related to fda matters  european restructuring and acquired in process research and development  a substantial portion of these charges were non cash in nature 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  and primarily related to capital expenditures during both periods 
the increase during fiscal reflects the construction of vai s cgmp protein production laboratory 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal also included proceeds of  related to the sale of common stock received in the demutualization of two insurance companies during the first quarter 
net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal activity on the revolving credit facility during fiscal includes approximately  related to repayment of the mortgage loan for the viral antigens facilities that matured in january net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements  debt service and dividends during fiscal capital resources the following table presents meridian s financing obligations as of september  amounts in thousands payments due for fiscal years beginning october total bank term debt   capital lease obligations subordinated debentures   meridian has a  credit facility with a commercial bank that includes  of term debt and capital lease capacity and a  line of credit that expires in september as of december   borrowings of  were outstanding on the line of credit portion of this facility  and the availability was  a substantial portion of the bank term debt   is denominated in the euro currency and bears interest at a variable rate tied to euro libor 
a one percentage point increase in the euro libor rate would increase fiscal interest expense by  for this debt 
this debt serves as a natural currency hedge against certain euro denominated intercompany receivables 
the subordinated convertible debentures in the amount of  bear interest at a fixed rate of and have a conversion rate of 
the company expects that these debentures will be converted or refinanced at maturity 
the viral antigens acquisition  completed in fiscal  provides for additional purchase consideration up to a maximum remaining amount of  contingent upon viral antigen s future earnings through september  earnout consideration is payable each year  following the period earned 
earnout payments  if any  may require financing under the line of credit or other bank credit facility 
earnout consideration in the amount of  related to fiscal is due to be paid in the second quarter of fiscal and will be financed on meridian s line of credit 
meridian s capital expenditures are estimated to be  for fiscal  and may be funded with operating cash flows or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
capital expenditures relate to manufacturing and other equipment of a normal and recurring nature 
commitments royalties meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as  in fiscal market risk exposure meridian has market risk exposure related to interest rate sensitive debt and foreign currency transactions 
meridian has debt obligations in the aggregate amount of  outstanding at september   of which  bears interest at variable rates 
information concerning the maturities of interest rate sensitive debt is included in the discussion of capital resources above 
to date  meridian has not employed a hedging strategy with respect to interest rate risk 
meridian is exposed to foreign currency rate risk related to its european distribution operations  including foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables  as well as euro denominated term debt 
the euro denominated term debt serves as a natural hedge against a portion of the euro denominated intercompany receivables 
euro conversion on january   the european and monetary union took effect and introduced the euro as the official single currency for the participating member countries 
on that date  the currency exchange rates of the participating countries were fixed against the euro 
effective january   the legacy currencies were eliminated and the euro is the single currency for the participating countries 
meridian s systems have been updated to process euro transactions 
costs required to prepare for the euro have not been material to meridian s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the future impact  if any  of the euro on meridian s competitive position is unknown 
fda matters during january  the fda completed a follow up inspection of meridian s compliance with the quality systems regulations that govern the manufacturing of in vitro diagnostics 
this inspection included a review of  among other things  procedures for validation  document control  corrective actions and design control 
in june  meridian received a warning letter from the fda which summarized and reiterated certain of the observations made by the fda during their follow up inspection completed in january meridian responded to the warning letter on july  in january  meridian submitted a comprehensive plan to the fda outlining specific steps it committed to undertake to improve its quality systems 
to concentrate and focus resources on qsr compliance  meridian discontinued the manufacturing and distribution of approximately products 
the costs of implementing the plan included costs for outside consultants with experience in the quality system regulations  validation and computer software and equipment 
during fiscal  meridian incurred plan implementation costs in the amount of  primarily related to consulting fees 
meridian has considered the effects of incremental costs of compliance with qsr in its cost structure 
meridian continues to engage in activities designed to reduce costs  improve operations and replace products that were discontinued 
as a result of the decision to discontinue the manufacturing and distribution of approximately products  meridian could not recover the cost of certain assets  and consequently  recorded the following pre tax charges during fiscal in thousands product inventory write off  product recall costs write off of sales type lease receivables impaired instrumentation equipment impaired intangible assets  impaired intangible assets included portions of manufacturing technologies  core products  customer lists and goodwill related to these products 
impairment amounts for long lived assets were measured by comparing discounted future cash flow projections to the net book value of the assets 
in accordance with the fda s directive in the warning letter  in september  meridian engaged an independent auditor to evaluate meridian s progress in implementing its corrective plan 
based on an extensive review of documents and an on site visit  the auditors substantiated meridian s progress in addressing the issues raised in the fda inspection and warning letter 
as anticipated by meridian  the fda commenced an on site follow up inspection during late fiscal this follow up inspection was completed in august the fda issued several observations primarily aimed at fine tuning established quality control systems and procedures 
meridian submitted written corrective action plans to address these refinements and continues its periodic communications with the fda on the progress of its plan submitted to the fda in january and the observations from the recently completed inspection 
meridian expects cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund working capital needs  debt service and dividends during fiscal meridian is communicating with the fda on a periodic basis to advise it on the progress of its plan 
at present  it is uncertain whether meridian s actions will be sufficient so that no further remedial action or enforcement action by the fda will occur 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles requires management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition meridian s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates and cash discounts that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
management estimates reserves for rebate agreements and cash discounts based on historical statistics  current trends and other factors 
changes to these reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
during fiscal  meridian adopted eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including the reseller of a vendor s products 
eitf no 
affected the manner in which meridian estimates reserves for distributor rebate agreements 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
reserves for rebate agreements include components for reported but unpaid rebates to date and rebates not yet reported 
meridian s reserves for rebate agreements were increased by approximately  upon adoption of eitf no 
inventories meridian s inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis  except for inventories in the viral antigens business for which cost is determined on a last in  first out basis 
meridian establishes reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory writedowns would be required and this would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
changes to inventory reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
for the viral antigens purchase business combination  meridian elected to use last in  first out accounting for inventories for financial reporting purposes 
under last in  first out accounting  the stepped up inventory value will be charged to earnings in periods in which inventory quantities decline below those on hand at the purchase date 
to date  inventory quantities have remained above levels on hand at the acquisition date 
intangible assets meridian s intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  trade names and non compete agreements 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
during the first quarter of fiscal  meridian adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized over their useful lives  but rather  are now subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
meridian completed the transition analyses required by sfas no 
during the first quarter  and there were no impairments 
meridian completed its first annual impairment review as of september  there were no impairments from this review 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers an impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
meridian adopted sfas no 
effective october  there were no impairments from adoption 
meridian s ability to recover its intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  meridian s provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
meridian s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in meridian s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid in applicable foreign jurisdictions 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities in situations that do not involve a business combination 
sfas no 
requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred  rather than recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan
