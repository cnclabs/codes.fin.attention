overview risk of operating losses we design  manufacture and market specialty and general purpose medical imaging systems for the diagnosis and treatment of disease 
our newer products are directed towards medical specialties  such as diagnosing and treating breast cancer  in which image guided  minimally invasive therapies are replacing open surgical procedures 
we have experienced annual losses from operations for three of the past five fiscal years 
significant factors giving rise to losses include costs associated with excessive manufacturing capacity  intense competition for our markets  declining margins and demand for original equipment manufacture products  and a general slowdown in capital expenditures by hospitals 
we have taken steps to reduce costs and improve sales  including o entering into distribution partnerships in and with ethicon endo surgery for the marketing and sale of mammotest breast biopsy systems in the united states and in europe  o entering into a strategic alliance with analogic and kodak for the distribution of digital radiography systems 
o closure of our addison  illinois manufacturing facility in  o a workforce reduction of approximately in the third and fourth quarters of  and o other programs to increase efficiency sustained profitability will depend on many factors  including o the successful introduction of senoscan and achieving market acceptance of senoscan 
o sufficient demand for our products to offset the effects of the reductions in our original equipment manufacture business  o the adequacy of financial resources  o our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  o the effectiveness of our efforts to control manufacturing and other costs  o effective negotiation and implementation of product distribution arrangements  o effective implementation of marketing and sales strategies  and we expect continued fluctuations in quarterly and annual revenues  operating results and net income  depending on such factors as o the timing of large system product orders  o the success of new product introductions like senoscan or marketing initiatives by us or our competitors  o the effects of managed healthcare on hospital  clinic and other capital expenditures and reimbursement  o increases in marketing and other costs in relation to sales  and o seasonal patterns and other timing issues affecting customer purchasing decisions 
these factors can occur unexpectedly and  because many of our costs are fixed  we may not be able to sufficiently reduce our costs in periods when revenues are less than anticipated and may  as a result  suffer unexpected losses 
please see item  business risk factors for additional factors which may unexpectedly reduce our revenues 
government regulation we are subject to periodic inspections by the food and drug administration  or fda  whose primary purpose is to audit our compliance with quality system regulations  which include testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
failure to satisfy fda requirements can result in our inability to receive awards of federal government contracts  an inability to receive new marketing or export clearances  or fda enforcement actions including  among other things  product seizure  injunction  and or criminal or civil proceedings which could be initiated without notice 
although we strive to operate within fda requirements  we may not be able to satisfy future fda compliance concerns 
sanctions resulting from fda compliance reviews or related delays in product clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business  our result of operations and the price of our common stock

the changes in the allowance are due mainly to the utilization of net operating losses  which have previously been fully reserved 
at december   we had valuation allowances of approximately million 
the reliability of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income  and our estimate of realizable deferred tax assets may change in the near future given the company s return to profitability

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue from the sales of systems and parts at the time the product is shipped 
the company recognizes revenue from services when they are performed  and from pre paid service contracts and extended warranty contracts in the periods for which the contracts are in effect 
the company bills for service contracts and extended warranties in advance  and records a liability for the amount of the deferred revenue until such time as the contract expires 
in its course of business  the company ships replacement parts to customers  and records related revenue at the time of shipment 
certain replaced parts may be returned for partial credit  and the company makes estimates to reduce current revenue to account for the future effect of those returns 
should such parts not be returned by customers  additional revenue may be recognized in future periods 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
contractual obligations at december  the companies commitments under contractual obligations as follows payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     recent developments not applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of our operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our line of credit is variable based on the prime rate and  is therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
on an as needed basis we draw down the line of credit and repay the balance when the temporary need for additional working capital is satisfied 
foreign currency risk over the past several years  we have expanded our international sales and marketing efforts 
our exposure to foreign currency and other international business risks may increase as our international business grows 
we attempt to minimize these risks by generally requiring payments in us dollars  using letters of credit  and requiring advance deposits and through other means 
our international sales efforts may not be successful and we may not successfully minimize associated risks
