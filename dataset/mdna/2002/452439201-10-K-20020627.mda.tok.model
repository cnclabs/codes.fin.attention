item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this form k 
general the company is an integrated home entertainment company  primarily engaged in the business of licensing and distributing entertainment programming 
the company licenses and exploits exclusive rights to a diverse array of general and specialty entertainment programming  such as music concerts and feature films  in dvd and other home entertainment formats 
in addition to the company s current core business of domestic dvd distribution  the company also licenses exclusive broadcast rights including video on demand  broadband streaming and digital download  pay per view  in flight  radio  satellite  cable and broadcast television 
the company not only licenses exclusive programming from third parties  it designs and produces additional content and value added features for its dvd programming such as interactive menus  packaging and marketing materials 
the company has also expanded its business and operations to produce its own original entertainment programming focusing on dvd live performance music 
the company s three reportable business segments are domestic wholesale distribution  including program licensing and production  retail distribution  which distributes programming direct to consumer and international wholesale distribution  including sublicensing and worldwide broadcast rights exploitation 
management currently analyzes the financial performance of these business segments based primarily on net revenues  operating costs and expenses and income loss before income taxes  to evaluate and allocate company resources 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has recently issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the company believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as contemplated by frr decisions involved in our critical accounting policies are based on management s exercise of judgment 
for a summary of all the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs for each reporting period  management estimates the total revenues to be received throughout a title s license period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs are charged to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenue are important in determining whether additional royalty expense or amortization of production costs should be recorded in any given reporting period 
royalty and distribution fee advances and production costs are amortized to expense in the same ratio that current period revenue for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue for that title 
additionally  when estimates of total revenues and costs indicate that a title will result in an ultimate loss  additional amortization is recognized to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees and production costs exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title and of similar titles 
management updates such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s exploitation 
inventory valuation for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our cost or market value and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable for each reporting period  management evaluates product sales and accounts receivables to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns and delinquent accounts 
management s estimate of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected requires the exercise of judgment and affects reported revenues and net income 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of image s products 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales that provide the customer with the right of return as well as the right to take pricing or other credit memo items 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
similarly  management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for image s larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on the information  management reserves an amount that is believed to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance as of march   as we believe we currently have the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following tables present consolidated net revenues by format and net revenues by format as a percentage of total consolidated net revenues for the fiscal years ended march  and the information in the table below does not represent segment data  but rather is presented for purposes of explaining certain trends within net revenues fiscal years ended march  change in thousands net revenues dvd exclusive   nonexclusive   total   vhs cd   broadcast sublicense   laserdisc  other as a percentage of consolidated net revenues dvd exclusive nonexclusive total vhs cd broadcast sublicense laserdisc other the following table presents consolidated net revenues by reportable business segment for the fiscal years ended march  and fiscal years ended march  change in thousands net revenues domestic wholesale distribution   retail distribution   international wholesale distribution   consolidated   consolidated net revenues for all segments for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  from  for the fiscal year ended march  factors that contributed to the decrease in consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  are detailed below 
net revenues for the company s domestic wholesale distribution segment for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  from net revenues of  for the fiscal year ended march  management believes this segment s revenue performance was negatively impacted by economic weakness in the retail sector over the first half of fiscal  coupled with the loss of exclusive revenues from the orion and universal license agreements which expired at the end of the last fiscal year 
revenue generated from these two agreements totaled  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
there was no revenue generated from these agreements in fiscal the company experienced revenue growth in its retail distribution and its international wholesale distribution segments for fiscal management believes that future revenue growth will be primarily dependent upon image s ability to continue to license new exclusive programming as well as renew existing license agreements upon their expiration 
net revenues for dvdplanet  the company s retail distribution segment  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  from net revenues of  for the fiscal year ended march  net revenues of dvd programming sold via the internet increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal management believes dvdplanet began to benefit from consolidation in the dvd internet retailing sector as well as the growing popularity of the dvd format 
management further believes a weak economic retail environment  especially in the first half of the fiscal year  negatively affected dvdplanet s revenues 
during fiscal  dvdplanet increased its selling prices to customers as well as shipping fees charged customers as part of management s plan to improve fiscal operating results 
shipping fees charged customers totaled  for fiscal  up from  for fiscal net revenues for the company s international wholesale distribution segment for the fiscal year ended march  were up to  from net revenues of  for the fiscal year ended march  for fiscal and  revenues of approximately  and  respectively  were derived from international wholesale distribution of image s licensed dvd and vhs programming  either through international distribution or international sublicensees 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  revenues of approximately  and  respectively  were derived from international and domestic broadcast exploitation of the image s licensed programming 
management expects that projected international growth of dvd player households as well as a growing catalog of image exclusive international dvd titles should continue to increase the company s international dvd revenues

in general  the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  will vary from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue recognized from various distribution formats and other factors 
revenues that typically generate the highest gross profit margins are from domestic distribution of exclusively licensed programming 
international distribution of exclusive programming typically generates somewhat lower gross profit margins due to lower international selling prices for dvd and vhs programming as compared to the united states 
revenues from non licensed exclusively distributed programming also generate lower gross profit margins than exclusively licensed programming 
revenues recognized from international sublicense of video programming and revenues recognized from domestic and international broadcast also generate lower gross profit margins than direct distribution of exclusive video programming due to normally higher royalty rates specific to those revenues 
revenues that generate the company s lowest gross profit margins are from nonexclusive distribution of video programming 
gross margins for the domestic wholesale distribution segment  as a percentage of segment revenues  increased by to for fiscal from for fiscal exclusive of the aforementioned credit to cost of sales related to laserdisc distribution  gross margins for the segment decreased by to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease was a result of lower revenues from sale of exclusive programming  due to the loss of the orion and universal agreements  in fiscal than fiscal  offset  in part  by lower manufacturing costs for exclusive programming during fiscal gross margins for the retail distribution segment improved by to for fiscal  from for fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily due to the increase in selling prices to customers as well as an increase in shipping fees charged to customers as part of management s plan to improve fiscal operating results 
gross margins for the international wholesale distribution segment decreased by to for fiscal from for fiscal for comparative purposes  excluding an impairment write down of  in advance royalties paid for the international distribution rights to a certain line of programming to the estimated fair value of the distribution rights  gross profit margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross margins was due to a more favorable sales mix of higher margin direct distribution revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal management expects gross margins to decline slightly from fiscal levels during fiscal as a result of declining dvd pricing internationally

image is incurring increasingly higher advertising and promotional expenditures on a specific title and line of programming basis

selling expenses for the international wholesale distribution segment increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of segment net revenues  selling expenses were down by to from for fiscal the decrease  as a percentage of net sales  was due  in part  to spreading of fixed segment costs over higher comparative fiscal revenues

the financial results of aviva and the international operations of image have been consolidated for segment reporting purposes under the operating segment international wholesale distribution 
during the quarter ended march   image began consolidating international wholesale home video distribution activities because management believes its existing infrastructure can more effectively and efficiently manage international distribution operations rather than shared responsibility with the staff at aviva

 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
the amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of sfas no 
image adopted the new rules for measuring the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets on april  during its fourth quarter ended march   image engaged houlihan lokey howard zukin  an independent financial advisory services company  to prepare certain analyses as a valuation basis for goodwill impairment testing and financial reporting purposes 
specifically they were engaged to express their conclusions as of april   regarding i the fair value of dvdplanet a reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
on an enterprise value basis to be used to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired and ii the fair value of the material identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of dvdplanet for use in determining the amount of goodwill impairment 
this is the only goodwill that exists at march  based upon their findings  the carrying value of image s acquired goodwill was determined to be impaired pursuant to the new valuation guidelines of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
will result in a one time  noncash  pretax charge of  the non operating impairment charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of the tax effect  in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ending june  in august  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring the impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in the quarter ending june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged by sfas no 
in april  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  which was later codified along with other similar issues  into eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf was effective for the company in the fourth quarter ended march  eitf clarifies the income statement classification of costs incurred by a vendor in connection with the reseller s purchase or promotion of the vendor s products  resulting in certain market development advertising and product placement costs previously classified as selling expenses to be reflected as a reduction of revenues earned from that activity 
as a result of applying the provisions of eitf  the company s revenues and selling expenses each were reduced by   and  for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which  effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   rescinds sfas no 
the companies that were previously subject to the requirements of sfas no 
are now to follow the guidance in american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films  issued in june sop establishes new accounting and reporting standards for all producers and distributors that own or hold the rights to distribute or exploit films

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment to sfas no 
 which is effective for all quarters of the fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company adopted sfas no 
on april  the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact its consolidated results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital requirements vary primarily with the level of its licensing  production and distribution activities 
the principal recurring uses of working capital in operations are for program licensing costs ie  royalty payments  including advances to program suppliers  distribution fee advances  manufacturing and production costs  costs of acquiring finished product for wholesale and retail distribution and selling  general and administrative expenses 
continued availability of sufficient working capital is a substantial limiting factor in image s ability to license new programming  and therefore maximizing available working capital is therefore critical to the company s operations

sources and uses of working capital for fiscal the company s net loss for fiscal was  during fiscal year  the significant uses of working capital in operating activities were royalty and distribution fee advances higher by  to obtain exclusively distributed programming and an increase in level of accounts receivable higher by  primarily due to timing of collections 
our sales to our largest customers grew during fiscal as compared to fiscal these larger customers have a tendency to be slower paying and accordingly  have increased the company s average collection period from days for fiscal to days for fiscal additionally  our revenues generated from international distribution were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s significant sources of working capital used to fund the company s operations during fiscal were increased borrowings under its revolving credit and term loan facility with foothill higher by  offset  in part  by principal payments reducing other debt obligations higher by

over the past months  the company has been on an aggressive licensing campaign to provide a foundation for future exclusive worldwide revenue growth  as well as to replace the exclusive revenues lost by reason of the expiration of the orion and universal agreements in march we believe that our aggressive licensing efforts will substantially contribute to our success as a leading independent provider of dvd programming  including music related and other entertainment programming
