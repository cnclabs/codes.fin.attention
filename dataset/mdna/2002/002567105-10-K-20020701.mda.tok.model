item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview abaxis  inc us or we develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary products consist of a compact kilogram analyzer and a series of single use plastic disks called reagent discs that contain all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests 
the system can be operated with minimal training and performs multiple routine tests on whole blood  serum or plasma using either venous or fingerstick samples 
the system provides test results in less than minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory 
we also market a hematology analyzer vetscan hmt  which provides a complete blood count cbc including three part white blood cell wbc differential in less than minutes and requires only ml of whole blood 
it provides results for eight selectable species  plus two user configurable programs 
we also market one type of reagent kit with this analyzer 
we currently market this system for veterinary use under the name vetscan and in the human medical market under the name piccolo 
we market the combination of the vetscan and the vetscan hmt under the name vetscan dxs 
in the fiscal year ended march   our domestic revenues accounted for of our total revenues versus in the fiscal year ended march   and international revenues accounted for in the fiscal year ended march  versus in the fiscal year ended march  the reason for the increase in domestic revenues and commensurate decrease in international revenues as a percentage of total revenues was due to the continued strengthening in the exchange rate of the us dollar 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
we generally operate with limited order backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would have an immediate materially adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 
until sales volume of our products  particularly our reagent discs  remain consistent or increase so as to offset associated fixed costs and to realize certain manufacturing economies of scale  we may experience losses 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our periodic operating results have in the past varied and in the future may vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including the level of competition  the size and timing of sales orders  market acceptance of current and new products  new product announcements by us or our competitors  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  component costs and supply constraints  manufacturing capacities and ability to scale up production  the mix of product sales between the analyzers and the reagent discs  mix in sales channels  levels of expenditure on research and development  changes in our strategy  personnel changes  regulatory changes  and general economic trends 
there has been little or no impact on our business due to inflation 
we introduced our vetscan canine heartworm antigen test in december the test is a stand alone lateral flow device similar in format to simple pregnancy tests 
results are available in a maximum of minutes 
we currently purchase the vetscan canine heartworm antigen test from sa scientific  inc  of san antonio  texas  a privately held leader in the development and manufacturing of a wide range of one step rapid tests for various diseases 
the addition of the vetscan canine heartworm antigen test further expands our product lines in the veterinary market 
we plan to continue to introduce various rapid antigen tests to expand our veterinary market in our fiscal year ending march  we intend to develop an abaxis rotor which will include the canine heartworm test in conjunction with other tests to be introduced in our fiscal year ending march  see contingencies below 
we continue to explore the application of our proprietary technology used to produce the dry reagents used in the reagent discs  called the orbos discrete lyophilization process  to other companies products 
this process allows the production of an accurate  precise amount of active chemical ingredients in the form of a soluble bead 
we believe that the orbos process has broad applications in products where delivery of active ingredients in a stable  pre metered format is desired 
we have contracts with becton dickinson immunocytometry systems and pharmacia biotech  inc to either supply products or license orbos technology 
we are currently working with other companies to determine the 
table of contents potential suitability of the orbos technology to these companies products 
as resources permit  we will pursue other development  licensing or manufacturing agreement opportunities for our orbos technology with other companies 
results of operations total revenues during the fiscal year ended march   we reported total revenues of  an  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  total revenues of  our revenues in the fiscal year ended march  increased  or from the fiscal year ended march  total revenues of  the increase in revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  were due to increased unit sales of reagent discs in the us and europe  increased orbos sales and sales of our vetscan canine heartworm antigen test introduced in december offset by decreases in unit sales of vetscan dxs 
the increase in revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  were due to increased unit sales of vetscan dxs and reagent discs in the us 
total revenues in the us for the fiscal year ended march  were  an  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  total revenues in europe for the fiscal year ended march  were  an  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of approximately  total revenues in asia and latin america were  a  or decrease from the fiscal year ended march  of  revenues from asia and latin america decreased as a result of the strength of the us dollar relative to the local currencies and the overall weakening of economic conditions 
we have shifted sales and marketing resources from the asian and latin american markets to the us and european markets in the fiscal years ended march  and we will continue to focus on developing our us and european markets in our fiscal year ending march  total revenues in the us for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  total revenues in europe for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or decrease from the fiscal year ended march  of  total revenues in asia and latin america in the fiscal year ended march  was  a or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of vedco  inc  a distributor of our veterinary products  accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended march   and  respectively 
product sales  net during the fiscal year ended march   we reported net product sales of  an  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  net product sales of  the change in net product sales was due to a decrease of  in instrument sales  an increase of  in reagent sales and an increase of  in other sales most of which was due to sales from the new vetscan canine heartworm test of  and an increase of  in orbos sales 
most of the increases in the fiscal year ended march  were due to increased sales in the us 
net product sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or from net product sales of  in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net product sales was due to an increase of  in instrument sales  an increase of  in reagent sales and a decrease of  in other sales most of which was due to a reduction in orbos sales 
most of the increased sales in the fiscal year ended march  occurred in the us 
our instrument and reagent sales accounted for and  respectively  of our product sales in the fiscal year ended march  compared to and  respectively  of our product sales in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we placed  instruments  which includes both blood chemistry and hematology analyzers  compared with  units placed in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in instrument sales reflects lower unit shipments primarily in the united states 
one of our goals for the fiscal year ending march  is to increase instrument sales by allocating resources to product selling and marketing 
we intend to introduce marketing programs emphasizing instrument sales 
we also plan to substantially increase our sales force and offer incentives programs to retain highly skilled sales professionals 

table of contents reagent discs shipped during the fiscal year ended march  were approximately  an increase of compared to the fiscal year ended march  shipments of approximately  reagent discs 
most of these reagent disc shipments were for veterinary applications 
the increase in reagent disc shipments during our fiscal year ended march  is consistent with our belief that there will be recurring reagent disc revenue as our product lines mature 
this growth is mostly attributable to the expanded installed base of vetscan dxs and higher consumption rates of institutional users 
development and licensing revenue during the fiscal year ended march   we reported development and licensing revenue of  a  or decrease from  in the fiscal year ended march  development and licensing revenue in the fiscal year ended march  increased  or from  in the fiscal year ended march  the fluctuations in development and licensing revenue during fiscal years ended march   and are due to changes in our customers use of our orbos technology 
cost of product sales cost of product sales for the year ended march  was  or of product sales  as compared to  or of product sales in the fiscal year ended march  in fiscal year ended march   cost of product sales was  or of product sales 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of revenue for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  was primarily attributable to continued increases in sales volume of reagent discs and lower unit costs resulting from improved manufacturing processes and absorption of fixed costs our current facilities 
the increase in cost of product sales as a percent of revenue for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  was primarily due to our manufacturing process being idle for six weeks during the third quarter of our fiscal year ended march   while we relocated to our current facilities with increased manufacturing capacity 
this temporary shutdown of manufacturing cost us approximately  selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march   and  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to one time charges of  incurred in our fiscal year ended march  associated with the relocation to new facilities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   is primarily the result of our facility relocation  launch of new products and an increase in headcount 
we expect the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense to increase in the fiscal year ending march  from the fiscal year ended march  but remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues 
we expect to increase our headcount in selling  general and administrative in our fiscal year ending march  to further expand our markets and support demands associated with increasing sales volume 
research and development expense we incurred research and development expenses of  in the fiscal year ended march  compared with  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  the  or increase in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to increases in pre clinical testing and clinical trials of new test methods  configuration of rotors and other project developments 
the  or decrease in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was the result of a decrease in headcount 
research and development activities accounted for of total revenues during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to of total revenues during the fiscal year ended march  and during the fiscal year ended march  we expect the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in the fiscal 
table of contents year ending from the fiscal year ended march  but remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues  as we complete development and clinical trials of new test methods to expand our test menus as well as other development projects 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will undertake such research and development activities in future periods or  if we do  that such activities will be successful 
interest and other income interest and other income totaled  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  interest and other income  for the fiscal year ended march   included approximately  of interest received for our reagent rental program  in which we offer our customers extended payment terms for the purchase of instruments with no right of return provided also that they purchase a minimum quantity of reagent discs or rotors from us over the contractual period 
also included in interest income was  from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest and other income  for the fiscal year ended march   included approximately  of interest received for our reagent rental program 
interest income for the fiscal year ended march  has decreased from fiscal year ended march  due to a decrease in interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents available for investment resulting from lower interest rates 
we expect interest and other income to increase in the fiscal year ending march  as our overall cash position is expected to be higher 
interest and other expense we incurred interest expense of  on equipment and working capital loans and totaling  on our building and capital leases during the fiscal year ended march   net of capitalized interest of  on the purchase and installation of our semi automated disc production line 
also included in interest expense  in the fiscal year ended march   was a cancellation fee of  related to the termination of our previous equipment and working capital loans when we signed our new agreements with another lendor in march we incurred other expense of  for currency losses during our fiscal year ended march  we incurred interest expense of  on equipment and working capital loans during our fiscal year ended march   net of capitalized interest of  on the purchase and installation of the semi automated disc production line and other manufacturing equipment in construction 
we also incurred a currency losses of  during our fiscal year ended march  we expect interest expense in our fiscal year ending march  to decrease as a result of proceeds raised in our series e preferred stock in march and april which will be used to meet working capital requirements and  therefore  lesser bank financing is expected to be used 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit totaled an expense of  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to an expense of  in the fiscal year ended march  income tax provision benefit totaled an expense of  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a benefit of  in the fiscal year ended march  income tax expense in the fiscal years ended march  and primarily represents taxes on the portion of taxable income for which net operating loss carryforwards could not be utilized under the federal alternative minimum tax rules 
the income tax benefit recorded in the fiscal year ended march  related to a tax refund received due to an overpayment of estimated state taxes in the fiscal year ended march  preferred dividends and accretion in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded preferred dividends and accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature of our preferred stock of  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march  and  and nil  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march  we expect dividend charges exclusive of charges related to beneficial conversion features to increase in the future due to annual cumulative dividends of of the original purchase price of our series e convertible preferred stock  which was issued in march and april liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods that will allow us to expand our veterinary market and further penetrate the human diagnostic 
table of contents market  acquisition of capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  debt financing  and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of our point of care blood analyzer products 
however  our sales are not predictable due to our limited market experience with our products 
net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to an increase of  in net income and decreases totaling  resulting from changes in trade receivables  inventories  deposits and other assets  accrued payroll and related expenses  warranty reserve  other accrued liabilities and deferred rent 
the decrease in trade receivables was attributable to lower outstanding days of sales in receivables as a result of better collections 
the decrease in inventory was due to lower inventory levels in fiscal year ended march  resulting from better inventory management 
our inventory level at the beginning of the fiscal year ended march  was relatively high compared to market demands 
our management has focused efforts on decreasing our inventory levels through our sales during the year 
these sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease of  in accounts payable resulting from payments to vendors for purchases made in the fiscal year ended march  and better management of inventory purchases volume as mentioned above in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net cash used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to decreases in accrued payroll and related expenses  warranty reserve  other accrued liabilities and deferred rent and increases in inventories  trade receivables  prepaid expenses and deposits and other assets 
the increase in inventories was mainly due to an increase in piccolo inventory for orders which did not materialize 
in anticipation of expected piccolo orders from the military and overseas  we built a surplus of instruments in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march   with the knowledge that we would not be able to build the instruments until our new facility in union city  california was certified by the fda 
the increase in trade receivables was due to increased sales 
these uses in cash were partially offset by a change from net loss to net income  and an increase in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended march  was  as compared to net cash used of  for the fiscal year ended march  and  for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net cash used from the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to significant purchases of property and equipment in connection with our relocation to our current facilities in  which was also the reason for the increase in net cash used from the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  was  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the fiscal year ended march  and  for the fiscal year ended march  net cash used by financing activities in the fiscal year ended march  was primarily the result of net repayments of  for borrowings and capital lease obligations offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily the result of net cash proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants of  and proceeds of borrowings under line of credit and equipment financing arrangements  net of repayments  of series e convertible preferred stock in march and april  we sold  and  shares of series e convertible preferred stock at  per share  respectively  resulting in aggregate net cash proceeds to us of  the series e convertible preferred stock is non voting and pays an annual cumulative dividend of of the original issue price per share  payable semi annually in either cash or shares of common stock at our election

table of contents the series e convertible preferred stock automatically converts into  shares of common stock upon the earlier of i the first date following march  on which the closing per share price of our common stock exceeds for twenty consecutive trading days the automatic price conversion date  or ii march   provided  however  that if the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on nasdaq national market system is less than for each of the twenty consecutive trading days immediately prior to and including march   then the series e preferred stock will convert into common stock automatically upon the earlier to occur of a march   or b the automatic price conversion date 
the shares may also be converted at the option of the holder at any time 
the number of common shares into which the series e convertible preferred stock is convertible is subject to adjustment for anti dilution  stock splits  and other certain events 
each series e convertible preferred stock investor received a warrant to purchase shares of common stock for each preferred share acquired 
the common stock warrants are valid for five years and exercisable at per share 
approximately  of the aggregate proceeds were attributed to the value of the warrants and allocated to common stock 
the fair value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of five years  volatility of  risk free interest rate of and no dividends during the contractual term 
in connection with the sale of the series e convertible preferred stock we issued  to advisors for services  fully vested five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of common stock 
the aggregate value of these warrants and shares of common stock of  was recorded as a stock issuance cost 
the value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions substantially consistent with those used for valuing the warrants issued to the investors 
in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of eitf issue no 
accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features of contingently adjustable conversion ratios to certain convertible securities  the allocated value of the series e convertible preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature calculated based on the difference between the effective conversion price of the proceeds allocated to the series e convertible preferred stock and the fair market value of the common stock at the date of issuance 
according  we determined an aggregate dividend charge of  representing the value of the beneficial conversion feature 
the amounts recorded in our financial statements at march   representing the amounts attributed to the initial closing in march  were as follows net cash proceeds  received by us on april   allocation to warrants issued to investors  warrants issued to advisors for services  and the amount of the dividend charge related to the beneficial conversion feature  line of credit and long term debt in march  we terminated certain line of credit and equipment financing loans and entered into new line of credit and equipment financing loans with another lender 
the new line of credit provides for borrowings of up to  up to  is collateralized by domestic receivables and up to  is collateralized by foreign receivables 
this new line of credit bears interest at the prime rate  which was at march   and is payable monthly 
of the  domestic line of credit   was committed to secure a letter of credit for our facilities lease 
the domestic line of credit terminates upon notification by either party and the outstanding balance is payable upon demand 
the foreign line of credit expires in september and is subject to renewal on an annual basis 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our line of credit facilities during the years ended march  and was and  respectively 
at march   the amount outstanding under our line of credit  which consists both of our domestic and foreign borrowings  was  and  was available for additional borrowings 
the balance of the new equipment financing loan at march  was  the equipment loan bears interest at the prime rate plus  which was at march   and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest totaling approximately  over a period of three years 
the equipment financing loans outstanding at march  totaled  the weighted average interest rate on equipment financing loans during the years ended march  and was and  respectively 
the line of credit and equipment financing agreements contain certain financial covenants  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
included in these financial covenants  among other stipulations  is a requirement that we have a minimum net income of  before preferred stock dividends and accretion in any three quarters of a fiscal year  provided that any loss before preferred stock dividends and accretion incurred in the remaining quarter is not to exceed  we are also required to be profitable on a fiscal year to date basis beginning with the six month period

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are generally recognized upon shipment when a purchase order has been received  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are generally not provided and provisions are made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the estimated future costs to be incurred under initial standard warranty obligations of one year 
revenues received for  or allocated to extended warranty arrangements are recognized ratably over the related warranty period 
instrument revenues under cross distribution agreements where we and another party purchase each other s products for resale are recognized upon sale of the products to the end user 
development and licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with the related contract terms 
we make estimates to adjust revenues for estimated sales allowances and rebates based on historical data and terms of current promotions  including cash rebates and trade in programs in which we issue credit to customers as incentives for purchasing our products 
although we believe these estimates are reliable  it is possible that actual allowance or rebate amounts realized could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such differences could affect our operating results 
reserves and accruals we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of amounts owed us by customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
in addition  we provide provisions for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligations of one year 
actual amounts realized could vary from our estimates and affect our operating results 
income taxes we have substantial deferred tax assets that relate primarily to prior period losses 
we evaluate these deferred tax assets by estimating the likelihood of our generating future profits to realize these assets 
as of march   we have assumed that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets and have recorded valuation reserves to reduce the net asset values to zero 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  or should we generate taxable income  we may be able to reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowances 
at march   we had approximately million of valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations as of march   we have the following outstanding contractual obligations in september we entered into a co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
the agreement was for an initial term of two years 
as of september   the co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories was terminated in accordance with its terms 
while this agreement was in effect  we incurred commission obligations to 
table of contents abbott laboratories which are payable over an approximate eight year period 
the present value of such obligations were recorded concurrent with the respective sales using a discount rate of 
future payments on commission obligations at march  are as follows fiscal year thereafter total commission obligations less amounts representing interest present value of commission obligations less amounts due within one year included in accounts payable long term commission obligation the outstanding balance of our line of credit  which is payable upon demand  was  at march  future principal payments on the equipment financing loan are as follows fiscal year ending march  the future minimum payments under capital and operating leases at march  are as follows capital operating fiscal year ending march  leases leases thereafter total minimum lease payments less amounts representing interest to present value of minimum lease payments less amounts due within one year long term portion 
table of contents in connection with our facility lease agreement  we have established a letter of credit for  which is secured by our line of credit 
purchase commitments 
we have entered into a non cancellable purchase commitment with one of our suppliers 
the outstanding commitment as of march  was approximately  this commitment is expected to be satisfied during fiscal in november  we arrived at general terms with sa scientific  inc  of san antonio  texas  to purchase canine heartworm antigen tests over a period of four years 
the outstanding commitment for the fiscal years ending march  through was    and  respectively 
we expect to enter into a formal contract based on these terms in the quarter ending september  as described under item litigation of this annual report on form k  one of our competitors  idexx laboratories  inc  has alleged in an action filed with the united states district court for the district court of maine that the canine heartworm antigen test supplied to us by sa scientific infringes on two of idexx s patents 
idexx has requested a preliminary injunction to prevent us from selling the canine heartworm antigen test and  in the event that either a preliminary or permanent injunction is issued against either us or sa scientific  we do not believe  based on the general terms that we have agreed to with sa scientific  that we will be obligated to purchase any of the canine heartworm antigen tests 
similarly  we have agreed with sa scientific that our commercial relationship will be renegotiated in the event that the canine heartworm antigen test produced by sa scientific is found to infringe upon either or both of idexx s patents and idexx does not offer us or sa scientific a commercially reasonable license fee for the patent or patents that would be found to have been infringed upon 
contingencies 
we are involved in various litigation matters in the normal course of business 
except for the unknown resolution of the lawsuit discussed below  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on march   idexx laboratories  inc  our principal competitor in the veterinary diagnostic market  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine civil action docket no 
p h alleging that a canine heartworm test produced for us by a third party  sa scientific  inc  and sold using the abaxis brand infringes on us patents nos 
 and  held by idexx 
in addition to claiming unspecified monetary damages  idexx has requested that the court issue an injunction to prevent us from selling our canine heartworm test until a judicial resolution of the claim has occurred 
we will incur expenses in the defense of such claims and our attention may be diverted from our operations 
if we are enjoined from selling our canine heartworm test product  our revenues may be adversely affected 
the parties are currently engaged in pre trial motions and depositions 
although we believe that the claims by idexx are meritless and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously  the outcome of the dispute cannot be predicted with certainty 
on may   we entered into an agreement with sa scientific  inc under which we both agreed to have joint representation by counsel to defend against the legal action filed by idexx

risk factors that may affect our performance the future events that we describe in these risk factors involve risks and uncertainties  among them are risks and uncertainties related to the market acceptance of our products  our continuing development of our products  obtaining required food and drug administration clearance and other federal  state and local government approvals  the manufacture and distribution of our products on a commercial scale  general market conditions  and competition 
when used in these risk factors  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  plans  future  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those that we project in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that we have set forth throughout this document as well as factors of which we are currently not aware 
we are not consistently profitable  we must increase sales of our piccolo and vetscan dxs products to maintain consistent profitability since our formation in and through march   we have had eight profitable quarters before preferred stock dividends and accretion  six of which occurred in the fiscal years ended march  and although we realized net income before dividends for all quarters in the fiscal year that ended march   there can be no assurance that we will experience profitability in the future 
as of march   we have incurred cumulative

our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products 
increasing our sales volume of our products will depend upon our ability to continue to develop our products  increase our sales and marketing activities  increase our manufacturing activities  and effectively compete against current and future competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully increase our sales volumes of our products to achieve sustained profitability 
we are not able to predict sales in future quarters and a number of factors affect our periodic results we are not able to accurately predict our sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to a limited number of distributors who resell our products to the ultimate user 
while we are better able to predict sales of our reagent discs  as we sell these discs primarily for use with analyzers that we sold in prior periods  we generally are unable to predict with much certainty sales of our analyzers  as we typically sell our analyzers to new users 
accordingly  our sales in any one quarter are not indicative of our sales in any future period 
in addition  we generally operate with limited order backlog  because we ship our products shortly after we receive the orders from our customers 
as a result  our product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders that we receive and ship in that quarter 
we base our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  in part on our expectations as to future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would immediately materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have historically experienced a decrease in our sales  especially in europe  in our second and third quarters 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our periodic operating results have varied in the past 
in the future  we expect our periodic operating results to vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including the size and timing of sales orders that we receive from our customers  market acceptance of our current and future products  new product announcements made by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing structures or the pricing structures of our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  the costs  and possible supply constraints  of the components that we use to build our products  our manufacturing capacities and our ability to increase the scale of these capacities  the mix of product sales between our analyzer and our reagent disc products  the limited size of our sales force  the amount we spend on research and development  changes in our strategy  changes in our key personnel  changes in regulatory matters  and general economic trends in the economy 
we may need additional funding in the future and these funds may not be available to us we believe that our existing capital resources  bank and equipment financing loans and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements 
table of contents through fiscal year  although no assurances can be given 
we will need additional funds  however  if we do not achieve anticipated revenues from the sale of our piccolo and vetscan dxs products 
in addition  we expect to incur substantial additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods to allow us to further penetrate the human diagnostic market and the veterinary diagnostic market  our need to acquire capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing implementation of our semi automated manufacturing lines to provide capacity for the production of commercial volumes of our products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
to the extent that our existing resources and anticipated revenue from the sale of our products are insufficient to fund our activities  we will have to raise additional funds from the issuance of public or private securities 
we may not be able to raise additional funding  or if we are able to  we may not be able to raise funding on acceptable terms 
we may dilute then existing shareholders if we raise additional funds by issuing new equity securities 
alternatively  we may have to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products and or sales territories if we are required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to raise needed funds  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are currently subject to a patent infringement action which  if resolved against us  could both adversely affect our financial position and hamper our business on march   idexx laboratories  inc  our principal competitor in the veterinary diagnostic market  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine civil action docket no 
p h alleging that a canine heartworm test produced for us by a third party  sa scientific  inc  and sold using the abaxis brand infringes on us patents nos 
 and  held by idexx 
in addition to claiming unspecified monetary damages  idexx has requested that the court issue an injunction to prevent us from selling our canine heartworm test until a judicial resolution of the claim has occurred 
the parties are currently engaged in pre trial motions and depositions 
although we believe that the claims by idexx are meritless and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously  the outcome of the dispute cannot be predicted with certainty 
we cannot estimate the effect of this potential liability on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in the event that the court finds in favor of idexx  we may be forced to pay idexx monetary damages  be enjoined from selling the canine heartworm product manufactured by sa scientific  need to enter into a license agreement with idexx pertaining to the patents  or a combination thereof 
further  we believe that offering a canine heartworm product is an important component of our suite of veterinary products and  in the event that we are enjoined from selling the canine heartworm antigen test manufactured by sa scientific  we may be unable to either develop an alternate canine heartworm product that does not infringe upon the idexx patents or idexx may offer us commercially unfeasible terms for licensing their patents 
consequently  our ability to further penetrate the veterinary market would be limited and thus our revenues and overall financial condition would be adversely affected 
even if we are successful in defending against the idexx action  the defense of such claims may become expensive and may divert our management s focus away from running our business which would thus adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on patents and other proprietary information  the loss of any of which would negatively affect our business as of march   we have filed patent applications in the united states and have been issued patents 
additionally  we have filed several international patent applications covering the same subject matter as our domestic applications 
the patent position of any medical device manufacturer  including abaxis  is uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual issues 
consequently  we may not be issued any additional patents  either domestically or internationally 
furthermore  our patents may not provide significant proprietary protection because there is a chance that they will be circumvented or invalidated 
we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  because the united states patent and trademark office maintains all patent applications in secrecy until it issues the patents and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature 
table of contents tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
we may have to participate in interference proceedings  which are proceedings in front of the us patent and trademark office  to determine who will be issued a patent 
these proceedings could be costly and could be decided against us 
we also rely upon copyrights  trademarks and unpatented trade secrets 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques that would undermine our proprietary technologies 
further  others may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
although we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute agreements the require that our corporate information be kept confidential and that any inventions by these individuals are property of abaxis  there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information would negatively impact our business 
we have limited marketing and distribution experience and few resources to devote to marketing and distribution we have been marketing our vetscan system products for less than seven years in the veterinary diagnostic market  and we have less than six years in marketing the piccolo system in the human diagnostic market 
we have only begun marketing our vetscan hmt products in the veterinary diagnostic market since fiscal accordingly  we have very limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  especially in the human diagnostic market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and maintain effective distribution arrangements  any distribution arrangements that we are able to establish will be successful in marketing our products  or the costs associated with marketing and distributing our products will not be excessive 
should we fail to effectively develop our marketing and distribution efforts  our growth will be limited and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
because competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  we may be unable to recruit or retain sales personnel  which could impact the sales of our products 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified biotechnology and medical device oriented sales and marketing personnel 
in particular  we have only nineteen full time sales personnel involved in our sales and marketing activities 
while these individuals work with our distribution partners both domestically and internationally to extend our market reach  the primary selling activities are often done by these individuals 
if we are to increase our sales  we will need to increase the size of our sales force and we intend to substantially increase our sales force in the fiscal year ending march  competition for these types of personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area 
further  we will need to train new salespeople and supervise them closely 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel  or attract and train additional qualified personnel  our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity to market our products 
we need to develop additional reagent discs for the human diagnostic market if we are to compete in that market we have developed a blood analysis system that consists of a portable blood analyzer and single use reagent discs 
each reagent disc performs a series of standard blood tests 
we believe that it is necessary to develop additional series of reagent discs with various tests for use with the piccolo and vetscan dxs 
currently  we have primarily developed reagent discs suitable for the veterinary diagnostic market 
in order to be competitive in the more lucrative human diagnostic market  we need to develop additional reagent discs that include certain standard tests for which the medical community receives reimbursements from third party payors such as hmos and medicare 
the tests that we need to develop to compete in the human diagnostic market are the lipid tests  which include hdl and triglycerides 
we may not be able to develop these new reagent discs on a timely and cost effective basis 
also  we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance for these new reagent discs 
further  even if we gain regulatory approval  we may not be able to successfully manufacture or market the reagent discs 
our failure to meet one or more of these challenges will materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we rely on distributors to sell our products  we rely on sole distributor arrangements in a number of countries we distribute our products primarily through distributors 
as a result  we are dependent upon these distributors to sell our products and to assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products 
we have a number of distributors in the united states who distribute our vetscan dxs products  although one of these distributors  vedco  inc  has accounted for a substantial amount of our sales in the united states to date 
we believe that our future growth depends on the efforts of these distributors 
if one of our distributors  particularly vedco  were to stop selling our products we may not be able to replace it 
we operate on a purchase order basis with vedco and vedco is under no contractual obligation to continue carrying our products 
further  many of our distributors may carry our competitors products  and may promote our competitors products over our own products 
finally  we do not have at this time distribution partners in the united states who distribute our products for the human diagnostic market 
we currently have exclusive distribution agreements in argentina  australia  austria  bahrain  china  greece  korea  mexico  new zealand  portugal  south africa  spain  switzerland  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
our distributor in each of these countries is responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals to sell our products 
these distributors may not be successful in obtaining proper approvals for our products in their respective countries  and they may not be successful in marketing our products 
we plan to enter into additional distribution agreements to expand our international distribution base and solidify our international presence 
however  we may not be successful in entering into additional distributor agreements 
our distributors may terminate their relationship with us at any time 
historically  we have experienced a high degree of turnover among our international distributors 
this high degree of turnover makes it difficult for us to establish a steady distribution network overseas 
consequently  we may not be successful in marketing our piccolo system and vetscan dxs products internationally 
we depend on sole suppliers for several key components to our products we use several components that are currently available from limited or sole sources 
two injection molding manufacturers currently make the molded plastic discs which  when loaded with reagents and welded together  form our reagent disc products 
we believe that only a few manufacturers are capable of producing these discs to the narrow tolerances that we require  to date  we have only qualified two manufacturers  one at two different sites  to manufacture the molded plastic discs 
moreover  we currently depend on one single vendor for a few of the chemicals that we use to produce the dry reagent chemistry beads 
further  our analyzer products use several technologically advanced components that are each available only from single vendors 
because we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for critical components to our products  we are particularly susceptible to any interruption in the supply of these products or the viability of our assembly arrangements 
the loss of one of these suppliers or a disruption in our manufacturing arrangements would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we compete with larger  better established entities such as hospitals and commercial laboratories blood analysis is a well established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and service organizations than we do 
we compete with the following organizations commercial clinical laboratories  hospitals clinical laboratories  and manufacturers of bench top multi test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on site 
we may not be able to compete with these organizations or their products or with future organizations or future products 
historically  hospitals and commercial laboratories perform the most human medical testing  and commercial laboratories perform the most veterinary medical testing 
our products compete with the commercial and hospital laboratories with respect to range of tests offered  the immediacy of results  
table of contents cost effectiveness  ease of use  and reliability of results 
we believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered 
clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment 
while our current offering of reagent discs cannot provide the same range of tests  we believe that our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories  in certain limited markets  on the basis of the other four factors 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively on cost effectiveness  ease of use  immediacy of results or reliability of results 
we also cannot assure you that we will ever be able to compete effectively on the basis of range of tests offered 
competition in the human and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in particular  many of our competitors have large sales forces and well established distribution channels 
consequently  we must develop our distribution channels and improve our direct sales force in order to compete in these markets 
changes in third party payor reimbursement regulations can negatively affect our business by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for blood testing services  third party payors  such as hmos  pay per service insurance plans  medicare and medicaid  can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our human testing products 
for example  the health care financing administration sets the level of reimbursement of fees for blood testing services for medicare beneficiaries 
if third party payors decrease the reimbursement amounts for blood testing services  it may decrease the amount that physicians and hospitals are able to charge patients for such services 
consequently  we will need to charge less for our products 
if the government and third party payors do not provide for adequate coverage and reimbursement levels to allow health care providers to use our products  the demand for our products will decrease 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations need for fda certification for our medical device products our piccolo products are regulated under the medical device amendments to the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration 
the fda classified our initial piccolo products as class ii devices 
class ii devices require us to submit to the fda a pre market notification form or k 
the fda uses the k to substantiate product claims that are made by medical device manufacturers prior to marketing 
in our k notification  we must  among other things  establish that the product we plan to market is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to the adoption of the medical device amendment or to a product that the fda has previously cleared under the k process 
the fda review process of a k notification can last anywhere from three months to over a year  and the fda must issue a written order finding substantial equivalence before a company can market a medical device 
to date  we have received market clearance from the fda for our piccolo system and reagent tests that we have on five reagent discs 
we are currently developing additional tests that the fda will have to clear through the k notification procedures 
these new test products are crucial for our success in the human diagnostic market 
if we do not receive k clearance for a particular product  we will not be able to sell that product in the united states 
need to comply with manufacturing regulations the medical device amendment also requires us to manufacture our piccolo products in accordance with good manufacturing practices guidelines 
current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in the quality system regulation 
these requirements regulate the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  storage  installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use 
our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic audits 
in addition  various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products 
for example  we have obtained a license from the state of california to manufacture our products 
in september  the fda granted our manufacturing facility in compliance status  based on the regulations for good manufacturing practices for medical devices 
we are scheduled for inspection by the fda and the state of california on a routine basis  typically once every months 
the most recent inspection was by the state of 
table of contents california in april with licensing for the new union city facility granted in early may we cannot assure you that we will successfully pass a re inspection by the fda or the state of california 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can comply with all current or future government manufacturing requirements and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the regulations  or if we do not pass routine inspections  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effects of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments on our products 
our piccolo products are affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments are intended to insure the quality and reliability of all medical testing in the united states regardless of where tests are performed 
the current clinical laboratory improvement amendments divide laboratory tests into three categories simple  moderately complex and highly complex 
tests performed using the piccolo system are in the moderately complex category 
this category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory 
hence  we can only sell our piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory 
to receive laboratory certification  a testing facility must be certified by the health care financing administration 
after the testing facility receives a laboratory certification  it must then meet the clinical laboratory improvement amendments regulations 
because we can only sell our piccolo products to testing facilities that are certified laboratories  the market for our products is correspondingly constrained 
consequently  the market for our piccolo products will be confined to those testing facilities that are certified as laboratories and our growth will be limited accordingly 
we are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
federal and state regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes would have on our business 
in addition  as we continue to sell in foreign markets  we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for our products in the united states or in foreign markets  and the failure to obtain these regulatory clearances will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with all applicable regulations of the food and drug administration and of the state of california  including quality system regulations  current regulations depend on administrative interpretations 
future interpretations made by the food and drug administration  the health care finance administration or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business 
we depend on key members of our management and scientific staff  and we must retain and recruit qualified individuals if we are to be competitive we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these key personnel  including in particular clinton h 
severson  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors  might impede the achievement of our business objectives 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
although we believe that we will be successful both in retaining our current management and scientific staff and attracting and retaining skilled and experienced marketing  sales and manufacturing personnel  we may not be able to employ such personnel on acceptable terms because numerous medical products and other high technology companies compete for the services of these qualified individuals 
we may inadvertently produce defective products  which may subject us to significant warranty liabilities or product liability claims and we may have insufficient product liability insurance our business involves applying sophisticated methods to raw materials and producing defect free medical test equipment 
although we have established procedures for quality control on both the raw materials that we receive from suppliers and our manufactured final products  these procedures may prove inadequate to detect a defect that either occurs in limited quantities or that we have not anticipated 
should we inadvertently ship defective products  we may be subject to substantial claims under our warranty policy 
further  our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human and veterinary medical products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance 
we believe that this insurance is adequate for our needs  taking into account the risks involved and cost of coverage 
however  our product liability insurance may be insufficient to cover potential liabilities 
in addition  in the future the coverage that we require may be unavailable on commercially 
table of contents reasonable terms  if at all 
even with our current insurance coverage  a mass product defect  product liability claim or recall could materially adversely affect our business or our financial condition 
we must comply with strict and costly environmental regulations we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies that govern the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in particular  we are subject to laws  rules and regulations governing the handling and disposal of biohazardous materials used in the development and testing of our products 
although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if our manufacturing to commercial levels continues to increase 
in addition  if a government agency determines that we have not complied with these laws  rules and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines and or take remedial action that would be expensive 
system failures or delays may harm our business and our facilities and manufacturing operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing operations  which are co located with our corporate headquarters in union city  california 
a failure of manufacturing operations  be it in the development and manufacturing of our vetscan or piccolo analyzers or the reagent discs used in the analyzers could result in our inability to supply customer demand 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant manufacturing capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if our union city location experienced a system failure  or regulatory problem that temporarily shut down our manufacturing facility  our manufacturing ability would become unavailable until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks or even months 
these manufacturing operations are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
additionally  our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
during  the western united states and california in particular experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
if such episodes recur  certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
in addition  due to these power supply shortages  we may be subject to significantly greater power costs which may adversely affect our financial results 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the possible lack of financial stability in foreign countries could prevent overseas sales growth our international sales are currently denominated in local currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the economic conditions of our overseas markets 

table of contents our stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk the market price of our common stock  like the securities of many other medical products companies  fluctuates over a wide range  and will continue to be highly volatile in the future 
the following factors may affect the market price of our common stock fluctuation in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulation  prospects and proposals for health care reform  governmental or third party payors controls on prices that our customers may pay for our products  developments or disputes concerning patent or our other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of our devices or similar devices developed by our competitors  and general market conditions 
because our stock price is so volatile  investing in our common stock is highly risky 
a potential investor must be able to withstand the loss of his entire investment in our common stock
