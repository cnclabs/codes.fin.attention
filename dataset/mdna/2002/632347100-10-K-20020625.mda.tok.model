item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as used in this report  the terms we  us  our and nathan s mean nathan s famous  inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates a different meaning 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed two acquisitions that provided us with two highly recognized brands 
on april   we became the franchisor of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system by acquiring the intellectual property rights  including trademarks  recipes and franchise agreements of roasters corp 
and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
our revenues are generated primarily from operating company owned restaurants and franchising the nathan s  miami subs and kenny rogers restaurant concepts  licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets and selling products under nathan s branded product program 
the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods 
in addition to plans for expansion through franchising and our branded product program  nathan s is continuing to capitalize on the co branding opportunities within its existing restaurant system 
to date  the arthur treacher s brand has been introduced within nathan s  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  the nathan s brand has been added to the menu of miami subs and kenny rogers restaurants  while the kenny rogers roasters brand has been introduced into miami subs and nathan s restaurants 
we have begun testing the miami subs brand in three company owned nathan s restaurants and one kenny rogers franchised restaurant 
in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  we determined that up to underperforming restaurants would be closed pursuant to our divestiture plan 
through march   we have terminated leases on of those properties 
we continue to market two of those properties for sale and terminated the lease for the last unit upon the lease expiration in may we also terminated additional leases for properties outside of the divestiture plan 
in the wake of the events of september   we have experienced lower sales at company owned restaurants and lower royalties from franchised restaurants that operate in markets which are significant tourist destinations such as las vegas and south florida 
during the initial months subsequent to september  we realized declines at our franchised restaurants operating at airports throughout the united states as a result of the overall decline in airline traffic 
at march   our combined system consisted of franchised or licensed units  company owned units and approximately  nathan s branded product points of sale that feature nathan s world famous all beef hot dogs  located in states  the district of columbia and foreign countries 
at march   our company owned restaurant system included nathan s units  four miami subs units and two kenny rogers roasters units  as compared to nathan s units  six miami subs units and two kenny rogers roasters units at march  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires management judgements regarding the future operating and disposition plans for underperforming assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of sfas has affected the amounts and timing of charges to operating results in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment of each restaurant individually  and record an impairment charge whenever we determine that impairment factors exist 
we consider a history of restaurant operating losses to be the primary indicator of potential impairment of a restaurant s carrying value 
we have identified certain restaurants that have been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to two restaurants   relating to one restaurant and  relating to three restaurants in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years  and  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  requires management judgements regarding the future collectibility of notes receivable and the underlying fair market value of collateral 
we consider the following factors when evaluating a note for impairment indications that the borrower is experiencing business problems such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions  whether the loan is secured by collateral that is not readily marketable  or whether the collateral is susceptible to deterioration in realizable value 
when determining possible impairment  we also assess our future intention to extend certain leases beyond the minimum lease term and the note holder s ability to meet its obligation over that extended term 
we have identified certain notes receivable that have been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to two loans   relating to one loan and  relating to six loans in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to franchisees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program 
notes and accounts receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets were net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessment of collectibility based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable is doubtful  the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no  revenue recognition 
we are self insured for portions of our general liability coverage 
as part of our risk management strategy  our insurance programs include deductibles for each incident and in the aggregate for a policy year 
as such  we accrue estimates of our ultimate self insurance costs throughout the policy year 
these estimates have been developed based upon our historical trends  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
accordingly  our annual self insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment  requiring significant management judgement 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  there are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before july   that were accounted for by the purchase method 
with respect to its goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   nathan s is required to adopt sfas effective in its next fiscal year  commencing april  nathan s will no longer amortize existing goodwill and certain intangibles having indefinite lives  thus reducing amortization expense by approximately  per year 
we expect to complete our impairment analysis during the first quarter fiscal and expect to recognize an impairment charge of approximately to million upon adoption of sfas no

sales from the branded product program increased by or  to  for the fiscal period as compared to sales of  in the fiscal period

fiscal was a week reporting period while fiscal was a week reporting period 
approximately  in restaurant sales were generated during the additional week of operations 
the unit reduction is the result of our franchising two company owned restaurants  transferring one company owned restaurant to a franchisee pursuant to a management agreement  closing four unprofitable company owned units including three miami subs restaurants pursuant to our divesture plan  selling one unit pursuant to an order of condemnation and closing one unit due to its lease expiration 
the financial impact associated with these nine restaurants lowered restaurant sales by  and improved restaurant operating profits by  versus the fiscal period  excluding any one time gains or royalties to be received from restaurants sold to franchisees

during the initial months subsequent to september   we have experienced lower royalties from franchised restaurants that operate in markets which are significant tourist destinations  such as las vegas and south florida  and from franchised restaurants operating at airports throughout the united states 
further contributing to the decline is an increase in the amount of royalties deemed to be unrealizable 
at march   franchised or licensed restaurants were operating as compared to franchised or licensed restaurants at march  franchise fee income derived from new openings and co branding was  in the fiscal period as compared to  in the fiscal period

during the fiscal period  nathan s recognized net gains of  in connection with the sale of two company owned restaurants and a third non restaurant property

additionally  lower cost of sales at the two kenny rogers roasters restaurants opened last year offset the higher costs at our comparable restaurants 
notwithstanding the lower costs and expenses of the two kenny rogers roasters restaurants  these restaurants continued to underperform 
consequently  we have decided to sell the kenny rogers roasters restaurant in rockville centre  new york 
the cost of restaurant sales at our comparable units as a percentage of restaurant sales was in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period due primarily to higher labor and related costs 
higher costs of approximately  were incurred in connection with the growth of our branded product program and higher product costs incurred for much of the fiscal period 
during the first twenty six weeks of fiscal  commodity prices of our primary meat products were at their highest levels in recent years causing the majority of the cost increase 
in response  we raised retail prices on a selective basis in an attempt to partially offset these increases 
beginning in the third quarter fiscal these costs were lowered to their historical levels 
however  should costs escalate again for an extended period  we may determine to further examine our pricing structure to attempt to reduce the impact on our margins

restaurant operating costs were lower in the fiscal period by approximately  as compared to the fiscal period as a result of operating fewer restaurants

management believes that available cash  marketable investment securities  and internally generated funds should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have not borrowed any funds to date under this line of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  sales and earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned nathan s stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
miami subs restaurant sales have historically been strongest during the period march through august  which approximates our first and second quarters  as a result of a heavy concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
as a result  we believe that future revenues may become slightly more seasonal 
impact of inflation during the past several years  our commodity costs have remained relatively stable 
as such  we believe that inflation has not materially impacted earnings during that period of time 
last year we experienced increased costs of our meat products and utilities resulting from increased commodity costs 
we also experienced increased costs for insurance attributable to the hardening of the insurance markets 
this year  various federal and new york state legislators have proposed changes to the existing minimum wage requirements 
the new york state assembly has voted to increase the minimum wage to an hour beginning january  with automatic annual increases  commencing january  based upon increases in the state s average weekly pay 
before being enacted  this proposal must be approved by the new york state senate and signed by the governor 
in addition  us senator edward kennedy has proposed increasing the federal minimum wage to an hour which would be fully phased in by january  if this proposal is passed this year  the first increase of an hour would take effect days later  followed by a cent an hour increase on january  and another an hour increase on january  us senate majority leader tom daschle has indicated that he wants to schedule a vote on this matter in the summer of we believe that these increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on our financial results 
prolonged increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins
