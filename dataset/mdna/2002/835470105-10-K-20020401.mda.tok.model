overview sonicwall designs  develops  manufactures and sells internet security infrastructure products designed to provide secure internet access to broadband customers  enable secure internet based connectivity for distributed organizations and process secure transactions for enterprises and service providers 
we believe our access security appliances provide high performance  robust  reliable  easy to use and affordable internet firewall security and virtual private networking vpn functionalities 
we also sell value added security applications for our access security appliances including content filtering and vulnerability assessment services  digital certificates and anti virus protection on an annual subscription basis 
our transaction security products provide high performance ssl acceleration and offloading to enable service providers and enterprises to deploy e commerce and web based applications without degrading web server performance 
we sell our products primarily to customers in the small to medium enterprise  e commerce  service provider  branch office and telecommuter markets 
as of december   we have sold more than  of our internet security appliances worldwide 
from inception through  we derived substantially all of our revenue from the development and marketing of networking products for apple macintosh computers 
these products enabled apple macintosh computers to connect to computer networks using ethernet communications standards 
the ethernet standard was developed in the s by xerox corporation and is the most widely used technology to facilitate communication between computers on local area networks 
the ethernet standard is defined by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and specifies the speed and other characteristics of a computer network 
in  we made a strategic business decision to concentrate our resources in the internet security market 
as a result  we stopped shipments of our ethernet product line during december in october  we introduced our first internet security appliance  the sonicwall dmz  and began volume shipments in we have since focused all our development  marketing and sales efforts on the internet security appliance market  and we have progressively introduced a broad line of internet security products and services from through our sonicwall product line provides our customers with comprehensive integrated security including firewall  vpn  anti virus  content filtering and ssl encryption and decryption functionality  giving users affordable internet security and secure internet transactions 
sonicwall delivers plug and play appliance solutions that we believe are high performance  easy to install and cost effective 
with current suggested retail prices ranging from to  our products are designed to enable customers to reduce purchase costs and avoid hiring costly information technology personnel for internet security 
by using an embedded single purpose operating system and a solid state hardware design without moving parts  our products maximize reliability and uptime 
the sonicwall access security products can be used in networks ranging in size from to  users and are fully compatible with vpn technology from more expensive enterprise security solutions offered by  among others  check point software  nortel networks and cisco 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has been dependent on large purchase orders from a limited number of distributors 
these purchase orders typically have short lead times and are subject to delay or cancellation without penalty 
we anticipate that our operating results for a given period will continue to depend on a small number of customers 
if we experience a decline in revenue from any of our significant distributors in a given quarter  our revenue for that quarter  or following quarters  will be adversely affected 
this could adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  if any of our significant customers experiences financial difficulties  our sales to these customers may be reduced  and we may have difficulty collecting accounts receivable from these customers 
any delay in large customer orders or customer financial difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we primarily use one contract manufacturer to manufacture our products 
we also rely on single or limited source suppliers to provide key components of our products 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is related to these suppliers 
these relationships are subject to a variety of risks 
acquisitions on november   we acquired phobos corporation phobos for million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
phobos designed  developed and sold scaleable ssl solutions for internet service providers  application service providers  e commerce companies and web hosting and enterprise network operations centers 
under the terms of the merger  shares of our common stock was exchanged for each share of outstanding phobos common stock at november   the closing date of the merger 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock  and options and warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock 
the total purchase price was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date the acquisition was announced 
in addition  we paid million in cash to the shareholders of phobos based upon their pro rata ownership percentage in phobos 
the merger agreement also provided for up to an additional million in cash to be payable upon achievement of certain quarterly revenue targets during  of which million was earned and recorded as additional goodwill 
on march   we acquired ignyte technology  inc ignyte in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
ignyte provided in depth consulting  design and support for enterprise networking customers  as well as management of their internet security needs 
as of the acquisition date we recorded the fair value of ignyte s assets and liabilities 
the resulting goodwill and other intangibles are being amortized over the expected useful lives of three to six years 
the total purchase price of million was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date the acquisition was announced 
the purchase price consisted of  shares issued for common stock and options of ignyte valued at approximately   in cash consideration and  in closing costs 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of redcreek communications  inc redcreek in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
redcreek developed and sold standards based internet security products for corporate data communications networks that enable the secure transmission of data between offices over the internet 
as a result of this acquisition  the company expects to expand its enterprise market share 
at the closing of the acquisition  we paid million in cash  assumed certain current accounts payable and other liabilities of redcreek  and forgave repayment of bridge loan amounts payable by redcreek to us that were used by redcreek to fund its operating expense from the date the purchase agreement was signed until the closing of the acquisition 
we also assumed redcreek s stock option plan and  options valued at  issued thereunder 
in the event redcreek products achieve certain quarterly sales targets during to  we are obligated to pay additional purchase consideration of up to million in cash  which payments would be recorded  if and when payable  as adjustments to goodwill 
during the course of  we completed several minor transactions for the acquisition of certain technologies and personnel for an aggregate purchase consideration of  shares of common stock valued at approximately  and approximately million in cash consideration 
results of operations the following table sets forth financial data for the years indicated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product license and service total revenue cost of revenue product license and service total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangible assets stock based compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared to product revenue 
revenue from sales of our products increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  net product revenue growth was across all geographies and products 
our small to medium enterprise sme products  including our tele  soho  xprs and pro product lines  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to almost of product revenues in our transaction security and large network access security products  including our ssl and gx product lines  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to less than in during  we generated approximately  or million  of product revenues from certain legacy products of acquired entities that have generally been brought to end of life within the first year of combined operations 
these revenues have been generated from network infrastructure products that are not part of our long term product strategy 
specific events during that impacted the growth of our product revenues include the following introduction of our third generation products and the gigabit performance access security appliances the gx series  introduction of transaction security products  which includes the ssl  ssl r and ssl r appliances  expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization to employees as of december  from employees as of december   expansion of our distribution channel  and an oem agreement with cisco for sales of our transaction security products 
we anticipate going forward a majority of our product revenues to be generated from the sme access security market 
we will continue to reach this market through our distribution and oem channels 
we have established an enterprise sales team to address the needs of large enterprises  and this team will focus primarily on selling our gx products into these access security opportunities 
in addition  we believe that successful penetration of these large networks is a means of furthering our penetration of the sme market products  as the perimeter of these large networks are the branch office and telecommuter opportunities of the sme market products 
our enterprise sales team is also selling our transaction security products into large enterprises  however this market is in an early stage of development and we do not expect transaction security revenues to represent more than of total product revenues in license and service revenue 
revenue from licenses and services increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  license and service revenue is comprised primarily of licenses and services such as vpn  anti virus protection  content filtering and node upgrades that are sold into the installed base of access security appliances 
in addition  we generate license and service revenues from extended warranty contracts  licensing of our global management software  licensing of our vpn asic  licensing of our firewall software  and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services 
our installed base has grown from approximately  units at the end of to approximately  units at the end of  and as a result we have generated significant growth in our integrated license and service products 
this growth has resulted from initial sales with new units as well as renewals of subscriptions for products such as content filtering and anti virus subscriptions 
in addition to generating approximately growth in sales of these integrated licenses and services in  we were also successful in licensing our firewall software and vpn asic to oem providers  such as netgear  under royalty arrangements 
these license and royalty fees grew to represent approximately of total revenues in professional services and training revenue represents approximately and of service revenue during and  respectively 
specific events during that impacted the growth of our license and service revenues include the following introduction of new subscription and upgrade products high availability  authentication services and vulnerability scanning  increased installed base from  units at the end of to  units at the end of  acquisition of ignyte  which increased our ability to provide consulting and training services  and introduction of version of sonicwall global management system 
we expect the market opportunity for our upgrade and subscription products sold to our installed base to increase as our installed base grows 
we are dedicating increased sales and marketing resources to sell into our installed base  and we are also focusing resources on marketing renewals for existing subscriptions 
in addition  in december  we introduced new service offerings across our product lines to provide our customers primarily maintenance releases of our firmware and technical support 
we believe these products will help expand our subscription revenues 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology are more difficult to predict 
unlike our upgrade and subscription products marketed to our installed base  we do not have dedicated sales and marketing resources to pursue licensing transactions for our technology  but rather we pursue these opportunities as they arise 
channel and geographic revenue data 
our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
these resellers then sell our products to end users 
two of our distributors  ingram micro and tech data  both of which are global computer equipment and accessory distributors  combined account for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro  and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
the significant majority of our growth was achieved through our distribution channels  which accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
during  we established an enterprise sales team to focus primarily on sales of our gx and ssl products to large enterprises 
while this sales team will have direct contact with the end customer  we expect to primarily fulfill orders to these customers through our existing channels 
in addition to our distribution channels  we also sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems who sell our technologies under their brand name 
we have three primary oem partners  which are com  netgear and cisco 
none of these customers represented more than of total revenues in both netgear and cisco became oem partners in  and com represented less than of revenues in oem revenues represented approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
approximately of our total revenues were generated in domestic markets in compared to approximately in accordingly  international revenues were approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
at the same time international sales grew to million in compared to million in  a increase 
however  domestic sales grew at a faster rate 
during  we expanded our sales and marketing infrastructure in both of our major international regions  europe and asia pacific 
in europe  our headcount increased to approximately employees at the end of from approximately employees at the end of in asia pacific  our headcount increased to approximately in from in we are investing in our international markets to increase revenue contribution from these regions to approximately of total revenues over the next two years 
while there can be no guarantee that we will achieve this objective  we believe that there are significant international market opportunities that warrant this level of investment 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars or at the rate at which they have grown in recent fiscal periods 
cost of revenue  gross margin 
cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including cost of materials  manufacturing and assembly costs paid to contract manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  warranty costs and inventory provisions or write downs are included in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased product sales 
gross margin increased to million  or of total revenue  in the year ended december  from million  or of total revenue  in the year ended december  this increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of higher gross margin security appliance products 
in addition  we experienced increased manufacturing efficiency and lower overhead and component costs per unit  due to the economies of scale 
gross margin was also favorably impacted by growth in license and service revenues which generated gross margins of approximately in the year ended december  our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors effectively for our gross margins to remain at current levels 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs related to engineering and technical support  contract consultants  outside testing services and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
research and development expenses increased by from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these expenses represented and  respectively  of revenue for such periods 
these increases were primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  fees paid to outside consultants  increased facility expenses related to additional leased facilities  prototyping expenses associated with the development of new products and ongoing support of current and future product development and enhancement efforts 
the october purchase of redcreek increased research and development costs related to additional personnel and increased product development and integration efforts 
we believe that significant investments in research and development will be required to remain competitive and expect that such expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions  costs associated with the development of our business and corporate identification  costs related to customer support  travel  tradeshows  promotional and advertising costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these expenses were and of net sales for such periods  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the continued worldwide expansion of our sales and marketing organization  including growth in the domestic and international sales force  increased commission and bonus expenses related to higher sales volumes and increased travel expenses 
facility expenses  depreciation and amortization also increased over the corresponding period of the prior year due to the additional leased facilities 
the acquisition of ignyte in march expanded the pre sales support  system engineering and technical support departments 
the addition of redcreek increased our worldwide organization with enterprise sales and marketing personnel 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in an effort to expand domestic and international markets  introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels and oem relationships 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  these expenses represented and of total revenue for such periods  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to increased personnel costs  expenses related to additional facilities and increased costs related to investor relations  shareholder matters and professional service fees 
we believe that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to build our infrastructure 
in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
on november   sonicwall finalized its acquisition of phobos 
as a result of the acquisition  million was allocated to goodwill and purchased intangibles 
this amount is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period ranging from three to six years from the date of acquisition 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in amortization 
in connection with the acquisition of phobos net intangibles of million were allocated to in process research and development 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired by us 
intangible assets  including goodwill  existing workforce and technology  are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of three to six year periods 
goodwill acquired after june  is not being amortized in accordance with sfas no

this amortization mainly relates to recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in the phobos  ignyte and redcreek acquisitions  and deferred compensation recognized on stock options granted in the years ended december  and we are amortizing deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
interest income and other expense  net 
interest income and other expense  net consists primarily of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the fluctuations in the short term interest rates directly influence the interest income recognized by us 
interest rates for the twelve month period ended december  decreased over the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  resulting in lower interest income 
the effect of lower interest rates is partially offset by the full twelve months of interest in compared with seven months in on the million of net proceeds generated by our follow on offering in march provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in the year ended december  was million 
the provision for income taxes in the year ended december  was million 
in both periods  the provision for income taxes is based on an estimated effective rate for each of the respective calendar years 
the effective tax rates in the years ended december  and were and  respectively  before the effect of amortization of deferred compensation  goodwill and intangibles  and in process research and development  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences 
this effective rate reflects statutory federal and state tax rates net of the estimated realization of deferred tax assets 
our annual operating results have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors including the level of competition  the size and timing of significant orders  product mix  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancement  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  hardware component costs  supply constraints  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  technological changes in the internet security market  the mix of sales among our sales channels  levels of expenditure on research and development  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  our ability to successfully expand domestic and international operations  general economic trends and other factors

factors impacting unit and revenue growth include introduction of our new products including the sonicwall provx  sonicwall xprs and the sonicwall telecommuter  expansion of our distribution channel  and increased sales under an oem relationship that was entered in july in december  we stopped shipment of legacy ethernet products which contributed million in the year ended december  and zero in the year ended december  this decrease was directly related to our decision to focus on development  sales and marketing efforts on our internet security appliance products 
license and service revenue 
revenue from sales of our licenses and services increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  factors impacting license and service revenue growth include introduction of our anti virus subscription service in june  increased worldwide demand of our vpn and content filtering  and higher software subscription and service revenues to support a growing installed base

internet security revenue has increased in each of the eight quarters ended december   due to increasing market acceptance of our security appliance products and the introduction of our third generation products in license and service revenue 
license and service revenue increased quarter over quarter due to increased services and an increased installed base 
new services in and included global management services  authentication services and vulnerability scanning 
gross margin 
our gross margin has generally increased each quarter 
these increases have been due to the increased sale of higher gross margin security appliance products  the reduction of production costs on a per unit basis as manufacturing volumes have increased  the reduction in materials costs due to increased purchase volumes  and improved absorption of manufacturing infrastructure costs 
in addition  license and service revenues  including anti virus  authentication services  and vulnerability scanning have higher gross margins and have increased in volume quarter over quarter 
gross margin decreased in the quarters ended december   june  and december  due to the increased shipments of oem products which have lower gross margins 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses have increased in each of the eight quarters ended december  to million from million in the quarter ended march  these increases related primarily to the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of phobos  ignyte and redcreek during the quarter ended december   march  and december   respectively 
we wrote off million of in process research and development related to the acquisition of phobos 
the remaining increase related to the development of new products  increased marketing of new products and increased investments in our internal infrastructure to support our growth 
we disclose pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings releases and investor conference calls 
our pro forma financial information does not include the amortization and write down of goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions  stock based compensation charges  and benefit for income taxes 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  consisting principally of commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government securities and money market funds 
for the year ended december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million to million 
our working capital increased for the year ended december  by million to million 
cash generated from operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the overall increase in cash from operating activities is the result of net loss adjusted for non cash items  which was offset by increases in accounts receivable and payables 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  primarily due to process improvements in billing and collection 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of million transferred from cash to short term investments  million used for purchases of property and equipment and million paid  net of cash acquired  for business combinations  including approximately million used in for phobos earnouts 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of million in cash transferred from cash to short term investments and million used in purchases of property and equipment 
in november  the company purchased phobos corporation for million  of which million was paid in cash to shareholders  million was paid in common stock  assumed options and warrants and million was incurred in closing costs 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in in and  cash was provided from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises 
in march  the company successfully completed its follow on offering of common stock which generated approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance to our products 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be our then current cash balances  funds from operations and whatever long term credit facilities we can arrange 
we have no other agreements or arrangements with third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources beyond twelve months 
as of december   our switzerland subsidiary had a line of credit secured by accounts receivables 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit and the agreement was cancelled on january  we do not have any other debt  long term obligations or long term capital commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases 
as of december   our aggregate future minimum lease commitments through totaled million 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserves  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily three sources i product revenue  which is comprised of hardware based appliances  ii licensing revenue for vpn upgrades  firewall and other software  and asic technology  and iii subscription and service revenues for products such as content filtering  anti virus protection  authentication services  vulnerability scanning  extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to of the distributor s prior quarter purchases  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
our largest distributor  ingram micro  has an unlimited stock rotation right  and therefore we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro until they sell the product to their customer  at which time their right of return expires 
we consider either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors and oem partners are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon our review of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  an appliance bundled with a year of free maintenance or content filtering  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement an amount equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for subscription services such as content filtering  anti virus protection services  authentication services  vulnerability assessment services  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
our training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the amount of revenues reserved for returns and other allowances amounted to approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
deferred tax assets were million  net of a valuation allowance of million at december   and million  net of a valuation allowance of million at december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identified intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded

addresses financial accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires a company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the retirement obligation is initially recorded  we also record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related tangible long lived asset and depreciates that cost over the useful life of the tangible long lived asset 
the retirement obligation is increased at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
upon settlement of the retirement obligation  we either settle the retirement obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates changes prior to maturity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
