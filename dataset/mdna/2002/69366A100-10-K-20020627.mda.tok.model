initial adoption of accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas requires the 
table of contents purchase method of accounting for business combinations consummated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company has applied the provisions of sfas to acquisitions initiated after june in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for reassessing the useful lives of existing intangibles and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential impairments of goodwill 
sfas requires the company complete a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required 
sfas requires completion of this first step within the first six months of initial adoption and annually thereafter 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
this allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in adjustment to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
in the initial year of adoption  any impairment loss identified is presented as a change in accounting principal and recorded as of the beginning of that fiscal year  net of its tax effect 
in years subsequent to the initial year of adoption  any impairment loss recognized is recorded as a charge to income from operations 
the company adopted sfas as of march   the first day of fiscal year during the second quarter ended september   the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment tests  which resulted in an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes of million

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company will apply the provisions of sfas beginning march  management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management and the audit committee believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate the company s financial position and results of operations include the following 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician supply business  imaging business  long term care business  and other  which includes unallocated corporate overhead and the company s recently divested european operations the international business  unless otherwise noted 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts from its customers 

table of contents the allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectable  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but later become uncollectable 
estimates are used to determine the allowances for bad debts and are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  changes in customer payment terms  and percentages applied to the accounts receivable aging categories 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
a credit review is performed on all gulf south customers  and a credit review is performed on new customers at di and pss 
at a minimum  each account is reviewed annually 
adjustments to credit limits are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be needed which will increase general and administrative expenses and decrease accounts receivable 
effective july   medicare s prospective payment system  which was applied to the long term care industry  limited government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
if there are changes to the government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other healthcare industry  adjustments to established allowances may be needed which may adversely affect accounts receivable and future sales  earnings and results of operations 
during the quarter ended december   the company recorded million of bad debt expense to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts at gulf south 
the increase to the allowance was primarily attributed to changes in assumptions concerning customers that were in bankruptcy based on information acquired during the quarter  including the fact that the company did not receive critical vendor designation for certain customers as it had received for other bankrupt customers in the past 
in addition  the increase was also attributed to i changes in reserve assumptions for nonperforming customers based on the change in assumptions discussed above  ii changes in management s credit policies and procedures  and iii changes in credit and collection department management 
estimating allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or estimated market value 
the company maintains allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and for the difference by which the cost of the inventory exceeds the estimated market value 
changes to the allowances are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
in order to determine the allowances  management reviews inventory quantities on hand  slow movement reports  and sales history reports 
the slow movement reports indicate inventory items that have not been sold in the last days 
management estimates the required reserve based on forecasted demand for products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management and if there is a decrease in demand for certain products  additional allowances may be required which will increase cost of goods sold and decrease inventories 
furthermore  equipment held for sale in the physician business and the imaging business is reviewed to ensure it is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
additional allowances may be required if there is a decrease in customer demand for certain equipment  a product line that the company decides to discontinue  or a significant deterioration in the condition of the equipment 
during fiscal year  the physician supply business recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold for a discontinued product line 
estimated useful lives of property and equipment 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets 
useful life buildings years leasehold improvements to years equipment to years software to years 
table of contents leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in business strategy  technology  or other factors  may shorten the useful lives of assets resulting in increased depreciation expense  which is an increase to general and administrative expenses  affecting results of operations in any given period 
furthermore  if there are changes to our business model that may affect the estimated useful life of an asset  accelerated depreciation may be recorded which will impact the company s results of operations 
during fiscal year and  the company revised the useful lives of certain assets in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting changes 
and recorded accelerated depreciation of approximately million and million  respectively 
accrued restructuring costs and expenses 
the company recognizes restructuring costs and expenses in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to improve customer service  reduce costs  and improve productivity and asset utilization  management may develop formal plans to exit certain activities  involuntarily terminate employees  and relocate employees 
these plans may include identification of duplicate facilities for closure and identification of facilities for consolidation into other facilities 
generally  completion of these plans will occur within one year from the date in which the plans were formalized and adopted by management 
however  intervening events occurring prior to completion of a plan can impact a previously established plan 
such intervening events may cause modifications to a plan and are accounted for on a prospective basis 
at the end of each quarter  management reevaluates its plans and adjusts previous estimates 
certain costs are recognized at the date in which a plan is formalized and adopted by management the commitment date 
these costs are generally related to employee terminations  lease terminations  and branch shutdowns 
certain other costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as a plan is implemented 
involuntary employee termination costs include employee severance costs and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
branch shutdown costs include costs related to facility closure costs  and are estimated based on historical experience of the total costs incurred in exiting a facility and quotes obtained from vendors 
given the complexity of estimates and broad reaching scope of the fiscal year restructuring plans  actual expenses could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expense 
restructuring costs and expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statement of operations and are separately disclosed in note  charges included in general and administrative expenses 
accrued restructuring costs and expenses are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
legal contingencies 
as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss 
the analysis is based upon potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets 
on march   the company adopted sfas during the quarter ended september   the company completed both steps 
table of contents of the transitional goodwill impairment tests  which resulted in an impairment charge of million net of income taxes of million 
the company has elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment test as of the last day of each fiscal year  which is the friday closest to march refer to note  goodwill  for further discussion of the impact of sfas on the company s financial position and results of operations 
management assesses the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and iv the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected discounted cash flow method 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets in the accompanying balance sheets
