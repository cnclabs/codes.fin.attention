all acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of the acquired entities are included in our consolidated statements of operations since their respective dates of purchase 
all goodwill and intangible assets associated with these acquisitions were being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
through these acquisitions  we have significantly increased our capacity to market cattle throughout the united states 
because of the significance of these acquisitions and the resulting additions to our products and services as well as the effect of the lease and operating agreements  our historical financial results may not be indicative of our future performance 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  consolidation of lease and operating agreements  and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from cattle sales transactions where we act as either a principal or agent in the purchase and sale of cattle 
for cattle sales transactions where we are the principal in the arrangement  we purchase cattle and take title from the seller  record the cattle as inventory until delivered to an accepted buyer and are exposed to both the inventory and credit risk that results from the transaction 
in these types of transactions  we record the gross revenue earned and related product costs incurred 
for cattle sales transactions in which we act as an agent  we sell cattle consigned to us on a commission basis  where we are not subject to inventory and credit risk  or we sell cattle on a fee basis and we record the net revenue earned 
for all other products and services offered by us  we act as a principal to the transaction and gross revenue and related product cost are recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab was followed by staff accounting bulletin no 
a  implementation issues related to sab  in march and by staff accounting bulletin no 
b  second amendment revenue recognition in financial statements sab b  in june in october  the sec issued a frequently asked questions and answers document to provide additional guidance 
these documents summarize certain views of the sec regarding applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec has provided this guidance due  in part  to the large number of revenue recognition issues that registrants encounter 
we believe that our current revenue recognition policies comply with sab principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of emerge interactive  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the consolidation also includes all activities with related entities  notwithstanding lack of technical majority ownership  which is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of a parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting stock 
specifically  the activities conducted by related party entities related to the lease and operating agreements are consolidated even though we do not have a voting control technical majority ownership 
rather we have consolidated these activities due to the parent subsidiary relationship created by the the lease and operating agreements 
minority interest reflects the lessee operators equity interest in the activities under the lease and operating agreements consolidated in the financial statements 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds 
we estimate projected future cash flows based on historical results  current and projected economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our projected future cash flows if management has made different judgments or utilized different estimates than actual results 
increases in estimated future cash flows will have no impact on reported goodwill  however  decreases in estimated cash flows could result in additional impairment charges 
also  increases in the discount rate used to project discounted future operating cash flows could result in additional impairment 
since the acquisition of our various cattle order buying and livestock marketing facilities the cattle industry has experienced difficulties due to an extended drought in the southern plains and the southeast  which led to a decrease in the availability of feeder cattle for sale  which has led to a significantly reduced number of head sold in each quarter of in addition  we shortened the useful lives by one to two years of the goodwill associated with lease and operating agreements since the term of the key employees non compete agreements were also reduced by one to two years 
as a result of this evaluation  the company determined that many of these acquired facilities estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of the associated long lived assets 
accordingly  we have reviewed goodwill associated with the acquisition of our cattle order buying and livestock marketing facilities and recorded an impairment charge of million in the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue from cattle sales  including leased operations during the fourth quarter of  increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase reflects a higher volume of cattle sales transactions brought about primarily through our acquisition activities 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million head of cattle versus million head sold in the comparable prior year period 
in the fourth quarter of  the leased operations accounted for  head of cattle sold 
revenue from other products and services remained constant at million for each of the years ended december  and we expect that cattle revenue  from owned or leased operations  will continue to account for the majority of our revenue base for the foreseeable future  while revenue from other products and services are expected to increase moderately over the next several years 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct cost to acquire cattle  and cattle related products 
in addition  cost of revenue also includes the indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and material purchases that are primarily associated with supporting our information 
table of contents management and individual animal tracking products and services 
with the higher volumes of cattle sales transactions generated in  cost of revenue attributed to cattle sales increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenue attributed to other products and services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due principally to higher indirect overhead and an increase in cattle related product costs 
we generated a gross profit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increase in total cattle sold as cost of goods increased in proportion to the increase in revenue 
we expect that cost of revenue  in particular the direct costs to acquire cattle  will continue to account for the majority of our total costs of revenue for the foreseeable future and will fluctuate proportionately with the changes in volume of cattle sales 
we anticipate that costs of revenue associated with other products and services will increase as sales of other goods and services increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to or million for the year ended december  from or million for the year ended december  our selling expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel  material and supply purchases  telephone  travel  consulting and advertising and media expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  selling expenses for the year ended december  included a non cash compensation charge of million associated with employee separations during the second quarter of the remaining decrease in sales and marketing expenses is due primarily to decreasing the number of personnel within the organization  this decrease in personnel affects primarily salaries and wages  but is also reflected in decreased telephone  travel and advertising costs 
we anticipate selling expenses will continue to decline slightly in the foreseeable future as the impacts of cost saving initiatives begun during the second quarter of  which included workforce reductions  become fully realized 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs for executive  administrative  and finance personnel  insurance program charges  public company expenses  telephone travel costs  and professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the overall increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily associated with the businesses acquired during and january  which accounted for approximately million of the increase  as the operations of these acquired businesses were included for the entire year ended december  the acquisitions expanded the number of personnel within the administrative organization and caused a corresponding increase in salaries and related benefits costs 
the remaining increase is due to a change in our expense allocation methods between selling expenses and general and administrative expenses for several over head expenses which increased the portions of telephone and health insurance expense allocated to general and administrative expenses for we expect general and administrative expenses to decline slightly in the foreseeable future as the impacts of cost saving initiatives begun during the second quarter of  which included workforce reductions  become fully realized 
technology and development our technology and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  payments to outside consultants  and maintenance charges and project material costs 
our expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily associated with the impacts of cost saving initiatives begun during the second quarter of  which included workforce reductions 
in addition materials  supplies and consulting expenses had significant decreases 
furthermore  the company has fewer products under development and products such as cattlelog  our exclusive individual animal data collection and reporting system  is essentially complete 
the primary focus of our development team is our meat inspection system  verifeye 
we expect to continue to incur 
table of contents costs to develop and commercialize new products  expand our offerings and adapt our technologies to new markets 
however  we anticipate that our technology and development expenses will continue to decline in impairment  restructuring and related charges during  the company recorded million in impairment and related charges including million in noncash asset impairment charges  million in severance and related employee costs and million in other closure  employee and professional costs 
the following paragraphs review our restructuring efforts and the basis for asset impairments 
in an effort to reset our cost structure to the current business level and focus on those products and services that have the most potential to add to our gross margin and help us achieve our near term profitability goals  we announced plans on may   to reduce our workforce by approximately personnel and write down to fair value the value of non strategic assets 
pursuant to these plans  we recorded restructuring and related charges of million 
the charge included million for asset write downs  primarily associated with discontinued product lines and a facility closing  an accrual for involuntary employee termination benefits and contract termination fees of million  and stock compensation charges of  associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options for certain terminated employees 
during the remainder of the year an additional workforce reduction was determined necessary to carry out our restructuring plan and we further reduced our workforce by approximately personnel 
based on final cost determinations for additional involuntary employee termination benefits  contract termination fees and costs to exit unused facilities  additional restructuring charges of  were recorded in september and december of the majority of the employee termination benefits accrued during the year were paid and funded with working capital prior to december   reducing the accrued restructuring liability to approximately  as of december  we anticipate that the actions taken this year will continue to result in additional cost savings during from may through january  we made twelve acquisitions consisting of cattle order buying or livestock marketing facilities  for approximately million 
approximately of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets 
in september  after assessment by a new management team  we determined that we needed to continue to focus on opportunities that have significant  sustainable revenues with meaningful gross margins 
we also determined that owning and operating these businesses do not best serve this focus 
accordingly  we entered into lease and operating agreements for our three largest cattle brokerage operations with the key individuals that were managing these businesses 
in general  the terms of the lease and operating agreements provide for the sharing of profits and losses  with the majority allocated to emerge  each facility securing its own line of credit for working capital purposes and each facility being responsible for its entire operation  including payroll and operating expenses 
we anticipate completing similar transactions in the near future with two more of our cattle brokerage operations 
we expect the net effect of these transactions will be to eliminate the need for working capital for these operations and the effect to ongoing operating cash flow  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  will be neutral 
in connection with these transactions and pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  including intangible assets of its cattle order buying and livestock marketing businesses 
since the acquisition of these businesses the cattle industry has experienced difficulties due to an extended drought in the southern plains and the southeast  which led to a decrease in the availability of feeder cattle for sale  which has led to a significantly reduced number of head sold in each quarter of compared to what has been sold historically by our acquired facilities 
in addition  we shortened the useful lives by one to two years of the goodwill associated with lease and operating agreements since the terms of the key employees non compete agreements were also reduced by one to two years 
as a result of this evaluation  the company determined that many of these acquired facilities estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of the associated long lived assets 
accordingly  as of december   the company adjusted the carrying value of the acquired facilities long lived assets  primarily intangible assets  to their estimated fair value of approximately million  resulting in a noncash impairment charge of approximately million 
the estimated fair value was based on anticipated future cash flows discounted at 

table of contents during  the company recorded million in impairment and related charges to write off the remaining net book values of accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles and fixed assets  and accrue for outstanding commitments that were associated with our nutricharge and infrared imaging products 
based on an assessment of our current operating environment  the resources required to successfully commercialize these products and our business strategies  we determined during this period that it was no longer feasible to continue offering these products 
the impairment charge primarily related to the write off of million in remaining net book values of intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher amortization charges resulting from business acquisitions completed in and increases in capital spending to support our infrastructure build up also drove higher depreciation during we expect depreciation and amortization will decrease next year with the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life 
other income and expense interest and other income  net decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased interest income generated by short term investments and the collection of a related party note receivable in november  which generated interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to interest expense incurred on the balances outstanding on our line of credit  which was entered into on august  during the fourth quarter of we conducted a physical inventory of our fixed assets and recognized a loss on disposal of  equity in operations of unconsolidated investee represents our share of turnkey s operations adjusted for amortization of equity method goodwill 
minority interest represents the lessee operators share of activities conducted under the lease and operating agreements that were entered into during the fourth quarter of on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and recorded a charge to operations of approximately  which is included as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the condensed consolidated financial statements 
due to the losses incurred  we did not recognize income tax expense for the years ended december  and as of december   we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income 
our tax loss carry forwards begin to expire in and we are not currently aware of any limitation on our ability to offset future taxable income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue from cattle sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase reflects a higher volume of 
table of contents cattle sales transactions brought about primarily through our acquisition activities 
during the fiscal year ended december   we sold approximately million head of cattle versus  head sold in the comparable prior year period 
revenue from other products and services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to incremental revenues of approximately  derived from subscriptions to our comparative feedlot analysis and market information services  the addition of advertising revenue  and sales of cattle related products 
the increased revenue derived from other products and services was partially offset by a decline of approximately  in sales of our equine imaging systems and related inventory and relatively flat nutricharge sales 
in december  we determined that the additional resources required to successfully commercialize our nutricharge and infrared imaging products were not warranted given our current operating environment and business strategies 
accordingly  we determined during this period that it was no longer feasible to continue offering these products 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct cost to acquire cattle  cattle related products  and equine imaging systems components 
in addition  cost of revenue also includes the indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and depreciation  that are associated with supporting our expanding base of on line products and services and with the production of the equine imaging system

higher costs of revenue for other products and services were partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with our equine imaging systems

these statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements  including the acceptance by our customers of electronic commerce as a means of conducting business  our ability to grow revenue  our ability to increase margins  our ability to implement our acquisition and expansion strategy  the impact of competition on pricing  general economic conditions  employee turnover  the impact of litigation and other factors 
other factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operation  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements 
readers of this report are cautioned to consider these risks and uncertainties and to not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases  the following factors should be considered while evaluating our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects we have an unproven business model 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately predict future results and our business strategy may not be successful 
while we commenced operations in and commercially released our initial product in november  our business model and strategy continued to change significantly 
this change makes predicting our future results of operations difficult 
our new business model has been tested over a limited period of time and  accordingly  we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful 
specific uncertainties relating to our new business model include our ability to expand the number of cattle producers  feedlots and packers that utilize our services  develop and upgrade our products and technologies more effectively and rapidly than our competitors  and successfully implement our sales and marketing strategies 
historically  we have funded our operating and investing cash requirements principally through private equity financings and through borrowings from xl vision and safeguard scientifics 
during february  we completed our initial public offering of  common shares and a private placement of  common shares  which generated net proceeds of million 
to the extent we are required to raise additional capital  we may need to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to us 
if such financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue to expand our business  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 

table of contents we have a history of net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the next two years 
if we continue to incur net losses  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
we reported a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses totaling approximately million 
our revenue may not grow or may not even continue at its current level and  as a result  our financial condition and results of our operations may be harmed and our business may not be financially viable in the future 
to achieve profitability  we must successfully address the following risks lack of wide scale commercial acceptance of our products and services  failure to expand the number of livestock industry participants currently using our network  inability to respond promptly to competitive and industry developments  failure to achieve brand recognition  failure to introduce new products and services  and failure to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased customer traffic 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business may be harmed 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  the patents or trademarks may be challenged by other parties or invalidated 
because brand recognition is an important component of our business strategy  the protection of our trademarks is critical to our success 
in addition  we depend upon our proprietary database of industry and client information to provide our clients with our information services 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and technology or obtain access to our confidential proprietary database 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
we may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate remedies available 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trademark protection may be unavailable in certain countries to which we might expand our operations 
in technology markets  there is generally frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights 
while we are not aware of any patents  copyrights or other rights that would prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or services in the united states and abroad  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
there also can be no assurance that former employers of our present and future employees will not claim that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our personnel 
we typically assume the ownership of cattle sold through our cattle brokerage business and are subject to the risk of loss while we hold title and market risk 

table of contents in the sales transactions conducted through our internet cattle sales and auction services network  we typically contract to purchase cattle from a seller  identify a buyer for the cattle  take title to the cattle from the seller and then resell the cattle to the buyer 
in this process  we enter into a contract to purchase cattle in advance of entering into a contract to sell the cattle 
therefore  until we actually complete a sale transaction  we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to sell cattle that we are contractually obligated to purchase 
in addition  once we purchase the cattle  we assume title to the cattle for generally up to hours 
as a result  we assume the risk of liability  loss and deterioration in value of the cattle during that period 
as a result  our business may be harmed 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that our revenue and operating results will vary in the future as a result of a number of factors 
our quarterly results of operations may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results in the future may not follow any prior trends and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results 
the factors that affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  the introduction of new or enhanced web sites  products and services by us  and continued purchases by our existing customers 
in addition  a number of factors that are beyond our control will also affect our quarterly operating results  such as demand for our products and services  product and price competition  the introduction of new or enhanced web sites  products and services by our competitors  and significant downturns in our targeted markets 
our quarterly results could fluctuate as a result of seasonal fluctuations in the cattle industry 
the cattle industry has historically experienced  and continues to experience  seasonal fluctuations 
these seasonal patterns may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results 
generally  a higher number of cattle are sold to feedlots during the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first and second quarters of each calendar year 
therefore  a greater number of sales transactions occur during these two calendar quarters 
due to our limited operating history and the recent changes in our business as a result of acquisitions  it is difficult to predict the effect that this seasonal pattern will have on our revenue and quarterly operating results 
our ability to develop new products is uncertain and our products may not develop as we anticipate 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of developing new products is inherently uncertain 
prospective products  such as our meat inspection system  require time and resources to develop  may not ultimately be commercially viable  may not achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace and may fail to receive regulatory approval  if required 
in addition  new products by competitors could adversely affect the realization of products that are commercially successful 
we could face liability for information retrieved from or transmitted through our web sites  which could result in high litigation or insurance costs 
as a publisher and distributor of online content  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we publish or distribute on our web sites 
any imposition of liability could negatively impact our reputation 
table of contents and result in increased insurance costs 
claims have been successfully brought against online services 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to cover us for all liability that may be imposed 
internet capital group and safeguard will be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may delay  deter or prevent acts that would result in a change of control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
internet capital group and safeguard are affiliated entities 
internet capital group and safeguard together have the power to vote approximately as of december  of the aggregate number of votes to which the holders of our common stock are entitled 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval 
in addition  currently four of the nine members of our board of directors also serve as directors  officers and or senior executives of internet capital group and safeguard 
internet capital group has the right to elect two directors to our board 
under the joint venture agreement  safeguard and internet capital group have agreed to vote for two designees of safeguard and two designees of internet capital group in all future elections of directors 
internet capital group and safeguard will therefore have the ability to significantly influence our management 
our common stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock  like the market for internet related and technology companies in general  has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  conditions or trends in the cattle industry  new sales formats of new products or services  changes in or failure by us to meet financial estimates of securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we held no derivative securities as of december  our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and their potential impact on our investment portfolio and debt structure 
we invest in marketable debt securities that meet high credit quality standards and limit our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted of  in cash equivalents with maturities of less than three months and million in certificates of deposit with a maturity of less than six months 
due to the short 
table of contents term  conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or the fair value of our portfolio 
the impact on our future results of operations and the future value of our portfolio will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments 
the interest rate on our debt floats based on the index rate 
accordingly  increases or decreases in the index rate would increase or decrease our interest expense 
a increase or decrease in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense approximately  in in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase and sale contracts for cattle that require delivery at a future date 
we also enter into a limited number of cattle futures transactions 
the contract lives are generally less than six months 
as of december   there were no open positions
