item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are also identified by words such a expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  projects  or similar expressions 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risk factors described in the risk factors set forth in item critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing our financial statements  we made estimates and judgments which affect the results of our operations and the value of assets and liabilities we report 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following summarizes critical accounting policies which require significant judgments and estimates in our preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company records revenue  other than on long term contracts  when a product is shipped 
revenue on long term contracts is accounted for using the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue and profits are recognized throughout the performance period of the contract 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
losses on contracts are recorded in full when identified 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable including warranty reserves as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of actual historical product returns over the past twelve months 
additional reserve is estimated for potential non collection of the receivable based on historical results 
the company has not experienced a non collection of accounts receivable materially affecting the financial position or results of operations 
the company records a slow moving inventory reserve as a charge against earnings for all products on hand that have not been sold to customers in the past twelve months 
an additional reserve is recorded for product on hand that is in excess of product sold to customers over the past twelve months 
the company records bonus and profit sharing estimates as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of operating income 
these estimates are adjusted to actual based on final results of operations achieved during the fiscal year 
certain bonuses are paid quarterly at a level of of the current year to date operating income with final payment in august of the subsequent fiscal year 
other bonuses and profit sharing are paid annually in august of the subsequent fiscal year 
from time to time  estimated accruals are recorded as a charge against earnings based on known circumstances where it is probable that a liability has been incurred or is expected to be incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net earnings net earnings decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the major contributor to the net earnings decrease was the general softening of demand for laser optics and component products in the industrial sector impacted by the weak worldwide economy 
bookings bookings decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of bookings outpacing shipments in fiscal the increase in backlog is primarily due to strong second half bookings  more specifically large orders recorded by significant military orders booked at laser power corporation  blanket orders recorded by ev products division and contract bookings for the development of silicon carbide 
manufacturing orders comprised of the backlog at june  manufacturing bookings decreased by approximately million while contract research and development bookings increased by approximately million 
bookings for laser optics and component products decreased approximately  primarily driven by delays in eom and aftermarket orders caused by a slowdown in the industrial sector 
bookings for laser power corporation were million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for eleven months ended june  during which period laser power corporation was owned by the company 
the overall decrease in the laser power corporation bookings was due to a decrease in commercial bookings more than offsetting an increase in military bookings 
bookings for the ev products division decreased approximately due to the absence of orders to replace fiscal year high volume orders such as the nasa swift telescope program and neoprobe bone densitometry 
bookings for the silicon carbide development activities of the wbg group were million 
revenues revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million last fiscal year 
revenues for laser optics and component products decreased approximately due to lower shipments of industrial laser oem and aftermarket sales from sluggish industrial worldwide demand  revenues from the ev products division decreased approximately from the absence in sales to replace the fiscal year volume sales primarily in the medical sector  and the company recorded revenues from laser power corporation of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for eleven months ended june  costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin was million or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal the dollar and percentage decrease was attributable to lower sales volume 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was also driven by a shift in the product mix during the past few quarters 
as the industrial business has slowed  the company has taken on more military business which historically has lower margins 
contract research and development gross margin was million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal compared to million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal the gross margin was negatively impacted during the year as laser power corporation and  more specifically  the large optics coating facility  encountered continued production issues related to several developmental contracts 
company funded internal research and development remained relatively unchanged at million in fiscal from million in fiscal in general  internal research and development expense reflects increased efforts focused on silicon carbide crystal growth technology and processing development  the company s corporate research and development activities and the research and development activities of ev products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this dollar and percentage decrease is attributable to the elimination of certain redundant expenses  as well as  expense and manpower reductions due to decreased manufacturing demand during fiscal other expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the other expense decrease was primarily due to the absence of approximately million of goodwill amortization incurred in fiscal see note e to the consolidated financial statements and foreign currency gains in as compared to losses in fiscal the overall decrease was partially offset by fiscal charges related to the closing of operations of laser power corporation in mexico of million  costs related to consolidating several of the company s european distribution arrangements of million  and the write off of certain crystal growth equipment and technology of million 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the lower borrowings and continuing decrease of the company s libor based interest rate as compared to fiscal the company s weighted average interest rate was approximately lower at june  as compared to the previous year 
scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan component of the company s credit agreement began in fiscal the effective corporate income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the favorable mix of worldwide earnings from the company s focus on increased manufacturing in china and singapore where tax rates are lower than the united states 
fiscal compared to fiscal net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the major contributor to the net earnings increase were higher revenues 
each contributor is explained further in this section 
bookings bookings increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of bookings outpacing shipments in fiscal and the addition of laser power corporation 
manufacturing orders comprised of the backlog at june  manufacturing bookings increased by approximately million  of which million was attributable to laser power corporation  while contract research and development bookings decreased by approximately million 
bookings for laser optics and component products increased approximately and bookings for the ev products division increased approximately 
these increases were attributable to strong demand for the company s laser optics and component products and continued acceptance of products of the ev products division 
revenues revenues grew to million in fiscal compared to million last fiscal year 
revenues for laser optics and component products increased approximately due to continued strong demand for infrared optics products  revenues from the ev products division increased approximately due to successful market launches and other new product acceptance in the marketplace  and the company recorded revenues from laser power corporation of approximately million 
costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin was million or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal the dollar increase was attributable to higher sales volume at all three of the company s segments 
increased sales included infrared optics and materials  detector products at the ev products division  and sales from laser power corporation 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects the addition of laser power corporation which has historically lower gross margins than the company 
contract research and development gross margin was million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal compared to million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal the company has increased the amount of contract research and development projects it undertakes and plans to increase this amount over the foreseeable future 
company funded internal research and development increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company continues to expand its internal research and development projects  including projects associated with developing nuclear radiation detectors at the ev products division  infrared optics and materials  and silicon carbide at the company s optical components businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this dollar increase is attributable to the addition of the selling  general and administrative expenses of the company s laser power corporation subsidiary  increased employment costs associated with new employees  increased payroll expense attributable to the company s worldwide profit driven bonus programs  and increased sales and marketing efforts 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflect the addition of laser power corporation and revenue improvements from the ev products division and the company s vloc subsidiary with limited corresponding increases to selling  general and administrative expenses 
other expense was million in fiscal compared to other expense of million in fiscal the increase in other expense was primarily attributable to the amortization of goodwill related to the purchase of laser power corporation 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was the direct result of additional borrowings in connection with the purchase of laser power corporation 
the effective corporate income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate reflects the completion of several international related tax opportunities during fiscal and the non deductible amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of laser power corporation 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  cash generated from operations was million 
proceeds from the net increase in borrowings of million in addition to the cash generated from operations were used primarily to fund an investment of million in property  plant and equipment  to finance a million investment for a ownership of a key supplier to the company  to acquire for million the litton systems  inc silicon carbide group and pay down million due on the term loan 
cash transactions for fiscal and cash on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year resulted in a cash position of million at june  the largest sources of the million in cash generated from operations in fiscal was million in net earnings before depreciation and amortization  an increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million 
this increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other operating net assets of million 
the impact of inflation on the company s business has not been material 
the company expects cash flow from operations to continue to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and internal growth 
during fiscal  the company reinvested million into capital projects 
risk factors we depend on highly complex manufacturing processes which require products from limited sources of supply we utilize high quality  optical grade znse in the production of a majority of our products 
we are a leading producer of znse for our internal use and for external sale 
the production of znse is a complex process requiring production in a highly controlled environment 
a number of factors  including defective or contaminated materials  could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality znse 
znse is available from only one outside source where quantity and qualities may be limited 
the unavailability of necessary amounts of high quality znse would have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  in fiscal and  we experienced fluctuations in our manufacturing yields which affected our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of znse 
there are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material 
our inability to effectively handle hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide 
hydrogen selenide can be obtained from one outside source 
the cost of purchasing such material is significantly greater than the cost of internal production 
as a result  purchasing a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would significantly increase our production costs of znse 
therefore  our inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we utilize other high purity  relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products 
failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is dependent on other cyclical industries our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end users of industrial lasers 
many of these end users are in industries that historically have experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products 
therefore  as a result  demand for our products and our results of operations are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
our revenues are subject to potential seasonal fluctuations due to our customers buying patterns  particularly in europe  revenues for our first fiscal quarter ending in september could be below those in the preceding quarter 
our first fiscal quarter results often are dependent upon the sales made in the last month of the quarter 
we may encounter substantial competition we may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market  including established companies with substantial resources 
some of our competitors may have financial  technical  marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors  and competition may adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
international sales account for a significant portion of our revenues sales to customers in countries other than the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the years ended june   and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we manufacture products in singapore and china and maintain direct sales offices in japan  the uk and belgium 
sales and operations outside of the united states are subject to certain inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  although our international sales  other than in japan  belgium and the uk  are denominated in us dollars  currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  by rendering us less price competitive than foreign manufacturers 
our sales in japan are denominated in yen and  accordingly  are affected by fluctuations in the dollar yen currency exchange rates 
we generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations through forward exchange agreements hedging approximately of our sales in japan 
we do not engage in the speculative trading of financial derivatives 
there can be no assurance  however  that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation in the dollar yen currency exchange rate 
our revenues may suffer if general economic conditions worsen our revenues and earnings may be affected by general economic factors  such as excessive inflation  currency fluctuations and employment levels  resulting in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for our products 
therefore  any significant downturn or recession in the united states or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may expand product lines and markets by acquiring other businesses our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions 
any acquisition may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  acquired businesses may be experiencing operating losses 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
in fiscal  we acquired the virgo optics division of sandoz chemicals corporation 
in fiscal  we acquired lightening optical corporation 
subsequently  these acquisitions were combined to form our vloc subsidiary 
in fiscal  we acquired laser power corporation 
in fiscal  we acquired the litton system  inc silicon carbide group 
our success depends on new products and processes in order to meet our strategic objectives  we must continue to develop  manufacture and market new products  develop new processes and improve existing processes 
as a result  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses  products  or technologies complementary to our business 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing  and product performance in the field 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse affect on our ability to grow our business 
failure to keep pace with industry developments may adversely affect our operations we are engaged in industries which will be affected by future developments 
the introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost effective basis new products  processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  applications and processes and product or process enhancements  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products  applications or processes  or that our products  applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products  applications or processes or product or process enhancements or if we did not gain market acceptance 
exposure to government markets with the acquisition of laser power corporation  sales to customers in the defense industry have increased 
these customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity  typically the us government 
most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body 
the loss or failure to obtain certain contracts or a loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on the ability to retain key personnel we are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists  engineers  production and management personnel 
competition for the services of these personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property we do not currently hold any material patents applicable to our processes and rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and employee non competition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that  in the future  third parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
asserting our rights or defending against third party claims could involve substantial expense  thus materially and adversely affecting our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in the event a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights  we may have to pay substantial damages or royalties  or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify the process so that it no longer infringes such proprietary rights  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our european sales rely on a single distributor a significant portion of our european sales not made by our subsidiaries in the uk and belgium have been made through a european distributor 
this distributor also provides service and support to the end users of our products 
thus  a reduction in the sales efforts of this distributor could adversely affect our european sales and our ability to support the end users of our products 
there can be no assurance that this distributor will continue to distribute  or to distribute successfully  our products and  in such an event  our business  results of operations and financial earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
we recently established controlling interest in a new joint venture with the distributor serving the german market 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
our stock price may fluctuate future announcements concerning us  our competitors or customers  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  seasonal or other variations in anticipated or actual results of operations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or reports regarding our industries in the financial press or investment advisory publications  among other factors  could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices may fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  military conflicts or market or market sector declines  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  any information concerning us  including projections of future operating results  appearing in investment advisory publications or on line bulletin boards or otherwise emanating from a source other than us could in the future contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we have adopted antitakeover devices which may limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our articles of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan contain provisions which could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover or make it more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
the provisions include classification of the board of directors into three classes  a procedure which requires shareholders or the board of directors to nominate directors in advance of a meeting to elect such directors  the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval  and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval at least two thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon  voting together as a single class 
a formal shareholder rights plan designed to protect all corporate interests in the event the company s board of directors and shareholders are confronted with an abusive or unfair takeover attempt 
in addition  the pennsylvania business corporation law contains provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
we are subject to stringent environmental regulation we use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities 
we believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local  state and federal environmental  safety and health regulations at each operating location 
we invest substantially in proper protective equipment  process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of such hazardous substances 
we annually conduct employee physical examinations and workplace air monitoring regarding such substances 
when exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been indicated  corrective actions have been implemented and re occurrence has been minimal or non existent 
we do not carry environmental impairment insurance 
relative to its generation and use of the extremely hazardous substance hydrogen selenide  we have in place an emergency response plan 
special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release to the atmosphere 
with respect to the production  use  storage and disposal of the low level radioactive material thorium fluoride  our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission 
this material is utilized in our thin film coatings 
thorium bearing by products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government approved low level radioactive waste disposal site in clive  utah 
the generation  use  collection  storage and disposal of all other hazardous by products  such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates  are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations 
we believe that all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business are in place 
although we do not know of any material environmental  safety or health problems in our properties or processes  there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which would have a materially adverse effect on us 
some laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed which could increase our costs and or reduce our revenues laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
the manufacture of lasers  laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of our products  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or in the use of defective or contaminated materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
to the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability  our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships could be adversely affected 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  some of our products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal action by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business or financial condition 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and issue relates to sfas requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and derivative financial instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
foreign exchange risks in the normal course of business  the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with its banks 
the purpose of these contracts is to hedge ordinary business risks regarding foreign currencies on product sales 
foreign currency exchange contracts are used to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency rates 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that permit it to sell specified amounts of foreign currencies expected to be received from its export sales for pre established us dollar amounts at specified dates 
the forward contracts are denominated in the same foreign currencies in which export sales are denominated 
these contracts provide the company with an economic hedge in which settlement will occur in future periods and which otherwise would expose the company to foreign currency risk 
the company monitors its positions and the credit ratings of the parties to these contracts 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments  it does not anticipate such losses 
the company entered into a low interest rate  million yen loan with pnc bank in september in an effort to minimize the foreign currency exposure in japan 
a change in the interest rate of for this yen loan would have changed the interest expense by approximately  and a change in the yen to dollar exchange rate would have changed revenues by approximately  for the year ended june  in september  the company replaced the million yen loan with a million yen loan effective september  see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risks the company entered into an interest rate cap with a notional amount of million as required under the terms of its current credit agreement in order to limit interest rate exposure on one half of the million term loan 
a change in the company s overall interest rate of would have changed the interest expense by approximately  for the year ended june
