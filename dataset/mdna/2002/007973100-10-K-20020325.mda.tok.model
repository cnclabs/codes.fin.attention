overview we design  manufacture and support a group of key subsystems for vacuum process systems 
our primary subsystems include complex power conversion and control systems 
our products also control the flow of gases into the process chambers and provide thermal control and sensing within the chamber 
our customers use our products in plasma based thin film processing equipment that is essential to the manufacture of semiconductors  compact disks  dvds and other digital storage media  flat panel computer and television screens  coatings for architectural glass and optics  and a power supply for advanced technology computer workstations 
we also sell spare parts and repair services worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
we provide solutions to a diversity of markets and geographic regions 
however  we are focused on the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which accounted for approximately of our sales in  in and in in and  the semiconductor capital equipment industry was at its historical peak for sales 
conversely  the year saw the steepest cutback in capital equipment purchases in industry history 
these cyclical changes accounted for the reduction in our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry between and however  during this period  we continued to achieve significant design wins on new equipment at manufacturers  which have resulted in solidifying relationships with our existing customers 
we expect future sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry to represent approximately to of our total revenue  depending upon the strength or weakness of the industry cycles 
in order to provide higher value products  the semiconductor capital equipment industry is in the midst of significant consolidation 
to help insure our continued growth and maintain our competitive advantage  we have done the following in april  we acquired noah holdings  inc  which manufactures solid state temperature control systems to control process temperatures during semiconductor manufacturing 
in august  we acquired sekidenko  inc  which supplies optical fiber thermometers to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
in january  we acquired engineering measurements company  or emco  which manufactures electronic and electromechanical precision instruments for measuring and controlling the flow of liquids  steam and gases for the semiconductor and other industries 
in january  we acquired aera japan limited 
aera primarily supplies the semiconductor capital equipment industry with product lines that include digitial mass flow controllers  pressure based mass flow controllers  liquid mass flow controllers  ultrasonic liquid flow meters and liquid vapor delivery systems 
these product offerings complement our position as a global leader for complex power conversion and control systems  and process instruments  allowing us to provide best of breed components and develop systems to increase the precision and productivity of our customers products 
it is also possible that we will acquire other companies or form strategic alliances as the industry consolidation continues 
we have taken strategic financing actions to enable us to pursue these investments 
in november  we completed two public offerings  one for million of convertible subordinated notes with a conversion price of  due in  and one for  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share 
these offerings provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million of these notes on the open market  leaving us with million outstanding 
these purchases resulted in an after tax net extraordinary gain of million 
in august  we completed an additional offering of convertible subordinated notes  providing aggregate net proceeds of approximately million with a conversion price of  also due in these financings are discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section 
we have also taken strategic marketing actions to provide for improved distribution channels 
in december  we completed formation of our wholly owned sales and service subsidiary in taiwan 
in october  we opened a representative office in shenzhen  china  to be responsible for market development  sales and technical support in china 
we have also begun developing a sales force focused on selling to end users of our products 
historically  our sales have primarily been to oem manufacturers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment  but many of our newer products can be marketed directly to the end user for new or previously installed equipment 
in some cases  the end user can direct the oem to utilize our subsystems rather than our competitors 
results of operations sales sales were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the changes in the level of our sales were primarily due to changes in demand for our systems from semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  including many of our largest customers 
the volatility in the semiconductor industry impacted overall investment activities  which led to semiconductor manufacturers purchasing less capital equipment 
while sales of semiconductor capital equipment have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately since  the industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand  and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
rapid growth and expansion during and part of was followed by the most sudden and pronounced slump in industry history  with year to year revenues falling approximately throughout the industry from to our sales over the last three years illustrate this cyclicality 
sales in and reflected the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry from the severe downturn of  and resulted from capacity expansion and increased investment in advanced technology by the semiconductor industry 
this two year recovery resulted in record sales for us  driven by sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the decrease in sales in was due to a worldwide slowdown in demand for semiconductors  which resulted in a sudden and rapid decline in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth resulted in reduced capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers

historically  the rapid changes in industry demand have resulted in significant increases in manufacturing capacity during upturns followed by severe underutilization of these facilities in subsequent downturns 
as the semiconductor capital equipment market s expansion of and was forecasted to continue into  we increased our manufacturing capacity in fort collins  colorado to meet this continued expected growth 
this facility was completed in the first quarter of when the industry downturn was just beginning 
while we understood that there was a risk of opening up a new facility after eight quarters of industry growth  the new facility was necessary to ensure our continued ability to meet demand and maintain our reputation as a leading supplier to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
this new facility also positions us to take advantage of the next up cycle in a much more efficient manner  which should have a positive impact on future operating results 
the industry is moving to mm equipment and smaller line widths 
these technology changes require new products that we have developed or are developing 
typical of products early in their life cycle and at low production levels  these products have lower margins than our established products 
margins on these products should improve over the next months 
we reduced our fixed overhead through headcount reductions in force of some of our manufacturing staff  when we saw our level of sales decline in  though we do retain certain knowledgeable employees with specific skill sets  to be ready for unexpected industry ramp ups 
our cost of sales has also been adversely affected by periodic writedowns of excess and obsolete inventory  often exacerbated by industry cycles  and recent warranty expenses in excess of historical rates related to certain products  which required substantial rework  repair  and in some cases  replacement 
given the rapid change in technology  we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally because of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
charges for obsolete and excess inventory were million in   in and million in  which affected gross margins by  and in these years 
the amount of inventory written down in is primarily attributable to the severe decrease in product sales  which caused a larger than normal amount of inventory to become excess based on recent sales forecasts 
we provide warranty coverage for our systems ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our systems under such warranties based on the historical average costs of the repairs 
we recognized charges for warranty expense of million in  million in and million in the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective  and based on estimates  and actual experience can be different than our expectations 
the improvement in gross margin from to was primarily a result of a more favorable absorption of manufacturing costs  which resulted from the higher sales base 
historically  price competition has not had a material effect on margins 
however  competitive pressures may produce a decline in average selling prices for certain products 
any decline in average selling prices not offset by reduced costs could result in declines in our gross margins 
research and development we believe continued investment in the research and development of new systems is critical to our ability to serve new and existing markets  develop new products and improve existing product designs to achieve our vision of convergent technologies 
we continue to invest heavily in new product development even during industry downturns  to be advantageously positioned for turnaround in demand for old and new products  which often occurs during sudden and unpredictable industry upturns 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of from to and from to as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from in to in because of the lower sales base  but decreased from in to in because of increased levels of revenue in the annual increases in expenditures from to are primarily due to increases in payroll  materials and supplies and depreciation of equipment used for new product development and partially due to the acquisition of emco in sales and marketing expenses as we continue our worldwide expansion  and expand our product offerings through acquisitions  our sales and marketing efforts have become increasingly complex 
we continue to refine our sales and marketing functions as we acquire and integrate new companies 
we have begun an effort to market directly to end users of our systems  in addition to our traditional marketing to manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment and other industries 
our sales and marketing expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in this represents a increase from to  and essentially no change from to the increase in expenses from to was to support the sales growth during the upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses increased from to in due to the lower sales base in  but decreased from in to in because of the higher sales base in  even while dollars spent increased 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate legal  patent  tax  financial  administrative  information systems and human resources functions in addition to our general management 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease from to is primarily due to lower spending for payroll  primarily employee bonuses  which were eliminated in due to the decline in operating profitability 
the increase from to is primarily due to higher spending for payroll  including employee bonuses  and purchased services 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in because of the lower sales base in  and decreased from in to in because of the higher sales base in general and administrative expenses in also included approximately  of legal costs in connection with patent infringement litigation 
goodwill impairment during the second quarter of  we terminated the operations of our tower electronics  inc subsidiary and our fourth state technology  or fst  product line  due to significant softening in the projected demand for these products 
revenue contributed by tower and fst operations for  and represented less than five percent of our total revenue in each of these years 
as a result of these actions  estimated related future cash flows no longer supported the carrying amounts of related goodwill  and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in related to tower and fst 
other operating expenses beginning in april  we made periodic advances to or investments in symphony systems  inc  a privately held  early stage developer of equipment productivity management software 
in addition to the approximately million received from us as investments  advances and license payments  symphony received investments of million from other parties 
in  we obtained an exclusive license  for which we paid million  to use symphony s products in the semiconductor industry 
in connection with certain of our advances  we obtained a security interest in all of symphony s intellectual and proprietary property 
beginning in the third quarter of  and continuing through the end of the year  symphony s financial situation began to deteriorate significantly  and we determined that due to its need for immediate liquidity  its declining business prospects including the indefinite postponement of a significant order for its products from a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer and other factors  the value of our investment in and advances to symphony had substantially declined 
given the precarious financial condition of symphony  we valued our investments in and advances to symphony at december   at approximately million  which reflects our assessment of the value of the symphony technology license  which has continuing value to us 
the amount of the writedown related to symphony was million  all of which was recorded in as an operating expense 
since symphony effectively ceased operations in february  we have hired its key employees and we intend to purchase symphony s remaining assets in a foreclosure  liquidation or bankruptcy sale in the near future 
at no time did our percentage ownership in the voting stock of symphony exceed approximately  and we have never had the ability to exercise significant influence over symphony 
restructuring and merger costs and one time credit in april  we acquired noah in a pooling of interests under the previous rules of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
the merger involved the exchange of  shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of noah 
as part of the business combination  we took a charge of million in the second quarter of for merger costs  which cannot be capitalized and which in certain cases were nondeductible for income tax purposes 
in july  we announced the consolidation of our tower facility in fridley minnesota  into our existing facility in voorhees  new jersey 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of related to the consolidation  which was completed during the fourth quarter of in august  we acquired sekidenko in a merger that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this merger involved the exchange of million shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of sekidenko 
as part of the business combination  we took a charge of million in the third quarter of for merger costs  which cannot be capitalized and which in certain cases were nondeductible for income tax purposes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  in the first quarter of  we received a million settlement for recovery of legal expenses pertaining to a patent infringement suit in which we were the plaintiff 
during the second quarter of  in response to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry  we implemented two reductions in force totaling approximately regular employees and temporary employees and recorded a charge of  for restructuring and severance costs  including fringe benefits 
we paid cash to the affected employees in this amount during the second quarter of  and at december  the remaining liability was not significant 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to the sustained downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and global economy  we announced and implemented additional cost reduction measures  and recorded a charge of million 
such measures included a reduction in force of employees  phasing out our austin  texas manufacturing facility to begin outsourcing the assembly of certain dc power products  the transition of our voorhees  new jersey facility from a manufacturing site to a design center  and the closure of noah s manufacturing and office facilities in san jose  california  due to the transfer of noah s manufacturing to vancouver  washington  to be co located with sekidenko 
these costs included payments required under operating lease contracts and costs for writing down related leasehold improvements for facilities 
at december   approximately million related to the fourth quarter of restructuring and severance actions was accrued as a current liability 
other expense income other expense income consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million in  million in and million in our interest income in was lower than in due to our use of cash and marketable securities to repurchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of and because of our purchase of emco in january the lower interest income in was also due to the decline in interest rates throughout resulting from the federal reserve s lowering of interest rates 
in  interest income was earned primarily from earnings on investments made from the proceeds of our initial public offering in and our underwritten public offering in in november  our cash and marketable securities increased substantially from the proceeds of additional offerings of convertible subordinated notes and common stock  resulting in higher interest income in interest expense consists principally of accruals of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  on borrowings under our bank credit and capital lease facilities and a state government loan  the latter of which has been repaid 
interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in the increase of interest expense from to was primarily due to interest on the convertible subordinated notes 
our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency losses of  in and  in  and a net foreign currency gain of million in the losses in and were due to a weakening of the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar  partially offset by the effect of our use of forward foreign exchange contracts 
the gain in was primarily due to strengthening of the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
since  we have entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we continue to evaluate various policies to minimize the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   we had million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
miscellaneous expense items were million in and  in miscellaneous income of million in was primarily due to a million gain on a sale of an investment 
benefit provision for income taxes the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective rate of 
the income tax provision of million in  which included million of provision for an extraordinary item  represented an effective rate of 
the income tax provision of million for represented an effective rate of 
changes in our relative earnings and the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries affect our consolidated effective tax rate 
we adjust our income taxes periodically based upon the anticipated tax status of all foreign and domestic entities  and have adopted income tax planning strategies to reduce our worldwide income tax expense 
extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market  for a cost of approximately million 
these purchases resulted in a pretax extraordinary gain of million  or million after tax  and reduced the level of our fixed cost interest expense until we acquired additional subordinated debt in the third quarter of summary results of operations the following table summarizes certain data as a percentage of sales extracted from our statement of operations years ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative goodwill impairment other impairments restructuring charges merger costs litigation recovery total operating expenses loss income from operations other expense income net loss income before income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary item benefit provision for income taxes minority interest in net loss income net loss income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net of applicable taxes net loss income quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

our levels of operating expenditures are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues that such expenses support 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the level of our revenues in a particular quarter  which include the risk factors listed above in the opening section of this management discussion and analysis 
our quarterly operating results in and reflect the fluctuating demand for our products during this period  principally from manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment  data storage equipment and flat panel displays  and our ability to adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet this demand 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry increased each quarter throughout then decreased each quarter throughout when that industry shifted into a sudden and severe downturn 
data storage sales fluctuated significantly throughout both years 
our revenue from all sectors is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in each of the industries we serve 
our gross margin maintained a relatively consistent level in each of the quarters in  at approximately 
we added new facilities in fort collins  colorado in the first quarter of to increase our manufacturing capacity to continue meeting this expected growth  which substantially increased our fixed costs 
then  as we entered the sudden and steep decline in volume from the semiconductor capital equipment industry in that quarter  the combination of declining sales and higher fixed costs resulted in lower absorption of fixed overhead and greatly reduced our gross margins throughout in addition  the industry slowdown caused more inventory to be deemed excess or obsolete  and warranty costs associated with certain products in excess of historical experience also adversely affected margins  particularly in the second and fourth quarters of research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable throughout the eight quarters of and  though they generally increased in the second half of as a percentage of sales  operating expenses have generally declined during periods of rapid sales growth  when sales increased at a rate faster than our need or ability to add personnel and facilities to support the growth 
these operating expenses as a percentage of sales have generally increased during periods of flat or decreased sales  when our infrastructure is retained to support strong customer relationships and anticipated future growth 
other expense income consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
changes in interest rates and changes in our level of investments in marketable securities drive the quarterly fluctuations in our interest income 
because the interest rates we pay on our long term debt are fixed  our levels of such debt determine our quarterly interest expense  which decrease when we repurchase such debt and which increase when we make new offerings 
changes in exchange rates and our ability to manage foreign currency exposure determine the quarterly fluctuations in our foreign currency gains and losses 
miscellaneous expense items vary according to the frequency of non operating events 
the largest single item in this category was in the third quarter of when we recorded a million gain on a sale of an investment 
our effective rate for income tax provision fluctuated on a quarterly basis throughout and  varying from to 
the fluctuations were due to the timing of certain nondeductible expenses including merger costs  and due to initiatives we implemented in to reduce our overall rate 
liquidity and capital resources our financing strategy has been to raise capital from debt and equity markets to provide liquidity to enable our investments in acquisitions and alliances  which support our strategic vision of being a single source provider of integrated solutions 
we maintain substantial levels of cash and marketable securities to have funding readily available for such investment opportunities when they arise 
since  to better enable such strategic investments  we have attained this liquidity with proceeds from underwritten public offerings of our common stock and  since  offerings of convertible subordinated debt 
operating activities generated cash of million in  primarily reflecting the impact on net loss of non cash items and impairments 
as part of this net cash provided of million  decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable provided cash of million 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of net income exclusive of non cash charges and credits  reduced by a net increase in working capital other than cash 
as part of this net cash provided of million  the net increase in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable used cash of million 
operating activities provided cash of million in  reflecting net income adjusted for non cash charges  offset by approximately million of net increases in receivables  inventories and payables 
we expect future receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
any increase in our inventory levels may require the use of cash to finance the inventory 
additionally  we may experience changes in our ability to collect payments from our customers because most of our customers experience the same volatility of the semiconductor capital equipment industry as we 
investing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of the acquisition of emco for million  the net purchase of investments of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
investing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of the purchase of property and equipment of million and the purchase of investments of million  offset by proceeds from the sale of investments and marketable securities of million 
investing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of a net increase in marketable securities of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of proceeds from convertible debt of million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted primarily of open market repurchases of our convertible notes of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted of net proceeds from convertible subordinated debt of million  net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million  and other proceeds of million 
we plan to spend approximately million in for the acquisition of equipment  leasehold improvements and furnishings  with depreciation expense for projected to be million 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions because our business experiences sudden changes as we move into industry upturns and downturns and expected sales levels change 
in january  we used cash of approximately million  in addition to assuming approximately million of debt  to purchase the outstanding common stock of aera 
in february  we agreed to purchase a privately owned  germany based provider of power supplies and matching networks  for approximately million to million 
we have also agreed in principle to acquire the remaining of litmas for approximately  shares of our common stock 
the expected annual capital needs of these acquired companies for are less than million 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit 
advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at either the prime rate at february  minus or the libor day rate at february  plus basis points  at our option 
all advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable june  as of december   there was an advance outstanding under this line of credit of  to our japanese subsidiary  advanced energy japan kk we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  leverage  net worth  and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were out of compliance with the maximum loss covenant as of december  we received a written waiver of the covenant and expect to be in compliance with all covenants during currently we are restricted from further use of our credit line because the low interest debt of approximately million that we assumed as part of the aera acquisition is not subordinated to our line of credit 
we are in the process of negotiating a new line of credit 
due to our very liquid balance sheet  we do not expect this restriction  which we believe to be temporary  to impact our operating or financing strategy 
to finance the facilities for our headquarters and main manufacturing  we lease our executive offices and manufacturing facilities in fort collins  colorado from a limited liability partnership consisting of two of our directors  one of whom is an officer  and other individuals 
the leases relating to these spaces expire in  and we also lease other office and production space from another limited liability partnership consisting of certain of our directors and other individuals 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through at least the end of after that time  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital  capital equipment or expansion needs 
in addition  any significant acquisitions we make may require additional equity or debt financing to fund the purchase price  if paid in cash 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when required or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
in  when our convertible subordinated notes become due  it is possible we may need substantial funds to repay such debt  which was million at december  our convertible subordinated notes of million are due september   and our convertible subordinated notes of million are due november  this could occur if our stock price remains at low levels throughout this period  the prices at which we can effect conversion are not met in the market in which our stock is traded  and the holders of our notes choose not to otherwise convert 
in such a situation there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and mutual funds 
these securities are highly liquid and of short maturities 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
in  the rates we earned on our marketable securities ranged from as high as to before tax 
as the federal reserve repeatedly lowered interest rates throughout  the interest rates we earn on our investments likewise decreased substantially 
this  in conjunction with using our available cash and cash reserves for acquisitions  including the emco acquisition in early and the aera acquisition in early  has greatly reduced our recent and anticipated interest income 
the impact on interest income of a percent decrease in the average interest rate would have resulted in approximately  less interest income in  million in and  in the interest rates on our subordinated debt are at fixed rates  specifically  at for the million of our debt due november  and at for the million of our debt that is due september our offerings of subordinated debt in and increased our fixed interest expense upon each issuance  though interest expense was partially reduced temporarily by the repurchase of a portion of the first offering in because these rates are fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
we have entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations for when we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
at december   we held foreign forward exchange contracts in japan with notional amounts of million and market settlement amounts of million for an unrealized gain position of  other risk we have invested in start up companies and strategic alliances and may in the future make additional investments in such companies that develop products which we believe may provide future benefits 
we have written down the majority of the cost of one such investment in  related to a strategic alliance we started in such current investments and any future investments will be subject to all of the risks inherent in investing in companies that are not established  or in which  due to our level of investment  we do not exercise significant management control 
we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  leverage  net worth  and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were out of compliance with the maximum loss covenant as of december  we received a written waiver of the covenant and expect to be in compliance with all covenants during currently we are restricted from further use of our credit line because the low interest debt of approximately million that we assumed as part of the aera acquisition is not subordinated to our line of credit 
we are in the process of negotiating a new line of credit 
due to our very liquid balance sheet  we do not expect this restriction  which we believe to be temporary  to impact our operating or financing strategy
