item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the year  net income was million  or per diluted common share  an increase of million or compared to net income of million for the previous year 
the improvement was the result of increased net interest income and noninterest income that more than offset an increase in noninterest expenses 
net interest income rose to million for  an increase of million or 
the net interest margin rose to during from during the prior year 
noninterest income reached million  an increase million or when compared to million the previous period 
noninterest expenses compared to the previous year increased million or 
the increases in noninterest income and noninterest expenses reflect the purchase acquisitions of mechanics in june  duff and phelps in november  center capital in march and three insurance agencies between the period of january and april included in the net income for the current year are a million net of taxes expense related to the cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting sfas no 
implementation and an extraordinary expense of million net of taxes that represents costs incurred for early extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
comparison of and years net interest income net interest income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the factors causing this change were an increase in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis to for from during the prior year and an increase in average outstanding earning assets during the year 
see the rate volume table that is contained elsewhere in this report 
the decline in interest rates during  combined with a steepening of the yield curve  resulted in a favorable environment for webster 
as rates dropped and mortgage and other callable assets prepaid at increasing levels  yields dropped as the assets were replaced with ones earning lower yields 
however  maturing and repricing liabilities were replaced at even lower costs due to the steepness of the yield curve 
as can be seen from the rate volume table that follows  of the increase in net interest income is due to changes in interest rates  with liability costs dropping much faster than asset yields 
the growth of million in average outstanding earning assets during outpaced the growth in average outstanding rate bearing liabilities of million 
due to earning assets growing faster than rate bearing liabilities  changes in volume represented of the increase in net interest income 
interest income total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year as compared to million during the previous year 
as discussed above  the increase was due entirely to increased volume of earning assets during as compared to the previous year 
although loans and other callable assets prepaid at increased volumes during due to the declining interest rate environment  webster was able to increase assets through the acquisition of mechanics in and center capital in as well as through the increase in consumer loans 
the increased consumer loans were primarily home equity lines of credit  the majority of which were originated within the bank s primary market area 
the yield earned on earning assets declined during to from during the year earlier 
the decline was entirely within the loan category as the yield on loans declined basis points  while the yield on securities and interest bearing deposits increased by basis points 
in addition to the larger volume of mortgage and other fixed rate loan prepayments during the current year  as discussed above  declines in interest rates impacted the returns on adjustable rate loans  which accounted for approximately of gross loans at december  interest expense interest expense declined million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million the previous year 
the decline in expense was entirely due to the decrease in cost of funds 
due to the short maturity structure of the wholesale borrowing portfolio  webster was able to take advantage of falling rates throughout two thirds of the benefit of declining costs was realized in the wholesale borrowing area 
the deposit area accounted for one third of the rate decline benefit 
savings  checking and certificate of deposit offering rates were decreased as general market interest rates declined throughout the year 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million for compared to the mechanics acquisition accounted for a portion of the volume increase as the balances were outstanding for all of  as opposed to only half a year in approximately half of the increase occurred in repurchase agreements and other borrowings due to their relative lower cost 
the remainder of the increase occurred in money market and checking accounts 
net interest income also can be understood in terms of the impact of changing rates and changing volumes 
the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have impacted interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rates changes in rates multiplied by prior volume and iii the net change 
the change attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

management performs a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
see the allowance for loan losses methodology section later in this management s discussion and analysis for further details 
based upon these reviews  it was determined that the provision for loan losses should be increased over the second half of several factors that influenced this increase included the following o the bank s strategic plan is to change the mix of the loan portfolio and increase the proportion of commercial and consumer loans and decrease residential mortgage loans 
commercial and consumer lending carry inherently more risk than residential lending 
o net charge offs increased to million during from million the previous year  an increase of million or 
the net charge offs were concentrated in the commercial lending area  which accounted for million  or  of the total 
o nonaccrual loans increased to million  or of gross loans  at december   from million  or  a year earlier 
o the general economic slowdown has raised concerns about employment stability and economic health in connecticut and the country 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of gross loans

the center capital acquisition added to loan fee income 
the continued expansion of webster insurance  with the purchase of levine in and wolff zackin  benefit plans and musante in  added to insurance commission income 
duff phelps was acquired in november and added income from financial advisory services 
webster s plan has been to expand its sources of noninterest income through the acquisition of fee based businesses and become less reliant on net interest income

comparison of and years general for the year  webster reported net income of million  or per diluted common share which was an increase of million or  over net income of million for the improvement for was the result of increased net interest income combined with higher noninterest income that more than offset the increase in noninterest expenses 
the increase in net interest income primarily reflects an increase of million in average interest earning assets and higher realized yields for interest rate spread was and interest margin was for noninterest income reached million  an increase of million or when compared to million for the rise in noninterest income was primarily due to higher income from fees  service charges  commissions and financial advisory services that were million over noninterest expenses compared to  excluding million of acquisition related costs  increased million 
the increase in noninterest expenses for is primarily the result of purchase acquisitions that were completed during the year and had the effect of increasing compensation and benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment and intangible amortization expenses 
net interest income net interest income increased million in to million from million in the increase is due primarily to a higher level of average interest earning assets and increased yields on earnings assets that more than offset the effect of higher volume of interest bearing liabilities and higher rates paid for such liabilities 
see interest income and interest expense discussions that follow 
interest rate spread for was as compared to for the decrease in interest rate spread was primarily due to higher interest costs incurred on time deposits and borrowed funds 
interest income total interest income for amounted to million  an increase of million or when compared to million in the higher interest income for was due primarily to an increase in the average volume of loans and higher yields realized on loans and securities 
the average balance on loans increased million in and the rate earned on loans increased basis points when compared to the increase in the average balance for loans comes primarily from higher balances for commercial loans of million and residential mortgages of million 
the average balance on investment securities decreased million in  however the rate earned on the securities increased basis points when compared to interest expense interest expense for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to million in the increased interest expense was due primarily to higher interest costs on borrowings that increased basis points for average outstanding borrowings increased during the year by million primarily due to fhlb advances that increased million and were offset partially by lower repurchase agreement borrowings of million 
higher rates paid on interest bearing deposits  particularly time deposits  combined with an average increase in outstanding deposits of million were also contributing factors to increased interest expense in compared to provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in gross loans of million and a shift within the loan portfolio to a higher concentration of commercial loans 
the allowance for losses on loans totaled million and represented of nonaccrual loans at december  versus million or of nonaccrual loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to gross loans increased to at december  from at december  reflecting the changing loan mix 
noninterest income noninterest income for totaled million and increased million  or  compared to million for fees and service charge income rose to million  an increase of  and insurance commissions doubled to million for the current year as compared to the increase in fees and service charge income was primarily due to a growing deposit and loan customer base and the acquisitions of mechanics in and necb in the latter part of noninterest income from trust and investment services increased million  or  during as compared to the increase for trust and investment income during reflects the expansion of customer services within the trust and investment areas 
the acquisition of duff phelps in november accounted for million of financial advisory fee income for net gains on the sale of securities increased million to million while net gains on the sale of loans and loan servicing remained consistent when and are compared 
noninterest income for included a net gain on the sale of deposits of million that resulted from the sale of two new hampshire branches in december the period also included life insurance benefit proceeds of million under the boli program 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were million compared to million in the results include acquisition related expenses totaling million related to the necb acquisition that occurred in december excluding acquisition related expenses  noninterest expenses for increased million or compared to the increase for is due primarily to purchase acquisitions that were completed during that increased compensation and benefits  occupancy and furniture and equipment expense and intangible amortization expense

liquidity and capital resources liquidity management allows webster to meet cash needs at a reasonable cost under various operating environments 
liquidity is actively managed and reviewed in order to maintain stable  cost effective funding to support the balance sheet 
liquidity comes from a variety of sources such as the cash flow from operating activities including principal and interest payments on loans and investments  unpledged securities which can be sold or utilized to secure funding and by the ability to attract new deposits 
webster s goal is to maintain a strong  increasing base of core deposits to support its growing balance sheet 
the bank s main sources of liquidity are payments of principal and interest from its loan and securities portfolio and the ability to use its loan and securities portfolios as collateral for secured borrowings 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system 
at december   outstanding fhlb advances totaled billion and the bank had additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million 
investment securities were not pledged as collateral for fhlb advances at december  had securities been used for collateral  additional capacity would be approximately billion 
the bank also has the ability to borrow funds through repurchase agreements  using the securities portfolio as collateral 
at december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million 
fhlb advances  repurchase agreements and other borrowings increased million from the prior year end  primarily to fund security purchases 
factors that affect the bank s liquidity position include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  cd maturity structure and retention  credit ratings  investment portfolio cash flows  the composition  characteristics and diversification of wholesale funding sources  and the market value of investment securities that can be used to collateralize fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
the bank s liquidity position is influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions and competition 
for example  as interest rates rise  payments of principal from the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio slow  as borrowers are less willing to prepay 
additionally  the market value of the securities portfolio generally declines as rates rise  thereby reducing the amount of collateral available for funding purposes 
management monitors current and projected cash needs and adjusts liquidity as necessary 
liquidity policy ratios are designed to measure the bank s liquidity from several different perspectives maturity concentration  diversification  and liquidity reserve 
actual ratios are measured against policy limits 
in addition to funding under normal market conditions  the bank has a contingency funding plan which is designed for dealing with liquidity under a crisis so that measures can be implemented in an orderly and timely manner 
webster s main sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends from the bank  investment income and net proceeds from borrowings and capital offerings 
the main uses of liquidity are purchases of available for sale securities  the payment of dividends to common stockholders  repurchases of webster s common stock  and the payment of interest to holders of senior notes and capital securities 
in november  webster issued million of senior notes with a fixed rate of 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information on the senior notes 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to webster 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information on dividend restrictions 
webster also maintains million in revolving lines of credit with correspondent banks as a source of additional liquidity 
during  webster repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock 
the majority of the repurchased shares was the result of an announcement during the third quarter of a stock repurchase program to acquire million shares of its common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning stock repurchases 
the bank is required by regulations adopted by the office of thrift supervision ots to maintain minimum levels of liquidity sufficient to ensure safe and sound operations 
adequate liquidity  as assessed by the ots  may vary from institution to institution depending on such factors as the institution s overall asset liability structure  market conditions  competition and the nature of the institution s deposit and loan customers 
management believes it exceeds all regulatory and operational liquidity requirements at december  applicable ots regulations require the bank  as a federal savings bank  to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage capital requirement and risk based capital requirements 
as an ots regulated savings institution  the bank is also subject to a minimum tangible capital requirement 
at december   the bank was in full compliance with all applicable capital requirements and met the fdic requirements for a well capitalized institution 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning capital 
the following tables summarize webster s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than total one year years years after years fhlb advances      other borrowed funds      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expirations per period commercial commitments total amounts less than committed one year years years after years lines of credit      standby letters of credit     other commercial commitment   total commercial commitments      asset liability management and market risk market risk consists of interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  commodity price risk and equity price risk 
webster s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the sensitivity of the economic value of webster s assets less the economic value of its liabilities and off balance sheet contracts equity at risk and the sensitivity of webster s earnings to changes in interest rates earnings at risk 
both types of risk measure a change in value for given changes in interest rates 
equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of the bank s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
it is a measure of the long term interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the bank s current balance sheet 
key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  asset prepayment speeds and decay rates on deposits 
earnings at risk analyzes sensitivity in net income after tax over a twelve month horizon 
it uses the same assumptions as equity at risk on the existing balance sheet  but also includes balance sheet growth assumptions over the next twelve months 
it is a measure of short term interest rate risk to reported earnings of the bank 
webster believes that an effective asset liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both long and short term interest rate risk in determining management strategy and action 
to facilitate and manage this process  webster has an asset liability committee alco 
the primary goal of alco is to manage interest rate risk to maximize net economic value and net income over time in changing interest rate environments subject to board of director approved limits 
the board approves limits for both equity and earnings at risk for parallel shocks in interest rates of plus and minus and basis points 
webster also regularly analyzes rate shocks of basis points as well as ad hoc scenarios for specific economic scenarios 
equity and earnings at risk are quantified using simulation software from one of the leading firms in the field of asset liability modeling 
from such simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented 
the simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitrage free trinomial lattice term structure model 
the base case rate scenario  against which all others are compared  uses the month end libor swap yield curve as a starting point and derives forward rates for future months 
using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs  the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with the forward rates as the mean 
in the shock scenarios  the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion 
future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case 
cash flows for all instruments are created for each scenario and each interest rate path using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date  amortization type  coupon rate and repricing date 
the asset liability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database provided by two other leading financial software companies 
instruments with explicit options ie  caps  floors  puts and calls and implicit options ie  prepayment and early withdrawal ability require such a rate and cashflow modeling approach to more accurately quantify value and risk 
on the asset side  webster s risk is impacted the most by a large amount of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors 
on the liability side  there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have the option to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time 
the bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time 
webster has three main tools for managing interest rate risk the size and duration of the investment portfolio  the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio and the pricing and structure of its loans and deposits 
alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook  the committee s interest rate expectations  the bank s risk position and other factors 
alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and sub committees  but monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis 
to a limited degree  various interest rate contracts including futures and options  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors may be utilized to manage interest rate risk by reducing net exposures 
these interest rate financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  credit risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the notional amount of interest rate financial instruments is the amount upon which interest and other payments under the contract are based 
the notional amount is not exchanged and therefore  the notional amounts should not be taken as a measure of credit risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for additional information 
futures and options positions and interest rate contracts may also be utilized to minimize the price volatility of certain assets held as trading securities 
changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period for which the change occurred 
the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease in webster s economic value of webster s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts  its equity at risk  at december  and  and the projected change to economic values  if interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points

management believes that webster s interest rate risk position at december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
financial condition at december   total assets were billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to total assets of billion at december  the increase in total assets for the current year period was primarily due to an increase in investment securities of million as compared to december  total liabilities increased million for the current year period primarily due to increases in deposits and borrowings of million and million  respectively 
total equity at december  was billion  a million increase from million at december  securities increased by million  or  to billion at december  as mortgage loans prepaid at accelerated speeds due to the low interest rate environment during  webster invested more of its available funds in its securities portfolio 
these additional investments were primarily mortgage related securities  as their balance rose to billion at december  from billion  an increase of 
loans receivable  net increased million  or  to billion at december  while the net balance increased slightly  webster made progress in achieving its strategic plan for the loan portfolio 
the plan called for an increase in the percentage of outstanding commercial and consumer loans  while lessening the reliance on residential mortgage lending 
residential mortgage decreased to of net loans at december  from a year earlier 
commercial and consumer loans increased to and  respectively  from and  respectively  a year earlier 
deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  deposits also reflected the success of webster s strategic plan 
the increase occurred entirely in the lower cost  non maturity deposits  as demand deposits  now accounts  regular savings and money market deposits increased by million  or while higher cost certificates of deposit decreased by million  or 
certificates of deposit decreased as a percentage of total deposits to at december  from a year earlier 
as a result of the combined effects of the decrease in interest rates during and the migration of deposits to lower cost  non maturity deposits  the weighted average interest rate dropped to at december  from a year earlier 
total borrowings increased million  or  to billion at december  due to the current low interest rate environment  a portion of the borrowings portfolio was extended to lock in the then current lower rates 
during  billion of fhlb advances outstanding at december  matured 
new borrowings consisted of approximately million refinanced into advances due within one year  while million were refinanced into advances which mature within years  million within years and million within years 
the lengthening effect of these transactions should reduce  to some extent  the volatility of borrowing costs over the short term 
total shareholders equity increased to over billion for the first time during  ending the year at billion  an increase of million or 
the major components contributing to this increase were undistributed net income of million and the unrealized net increase in the value of available for sale securities  net of taxes  of million 
asset quality the slowdown in economic growth that began in had an impact on the company s business during the year 
the increases in nonperforming assets  past due loans  classified loans and charge offs levels are reflective of the general slowdown in business activity 
management  as a result of its quarterly review of the loan portfolios  increased the loan loss provision in the second half of the year in recognition of these risk factors 
the level of the overall loan loss allowance has been increased to of gross loans at year end 
management believes the level of the allowance at december  is adequate for the level of risks in the portfolio 
nonperforming assets  classified assets  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by webster to be key measures of asset quality 
asset quality is one of the key factors in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses contained elsewhere within this section for further information on the allowance 
nonperforming assets webster devotes significant attention to maintaining asset quality through conservative underwriting standards  active servicing of loans and aggressively managing nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets  which include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more and accruing and foreclosed properties were million and million at december  and  respectively

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for information concerning webster s nonaccrual loan policy 
the increase in nonaccrual loans of million  or  was due entirely to an increase in commercial nonaccrual loans  while declines occurred in each of the other loan categories 
the increase in commercial nonaccruals resulted from the addition of million of nonaccruing leases from center capital  which was purchased in march  one commercial middle market credit of million and one specialized lending unit loan of million 
the increase in nonaccruals at center capital is comprised of loans  distributing the potential for loss over many customers 
in addition to the equipment collateral  the company generally obtains personal guarantees  where possible  and its net charge offs ratio for the past three years has averaged

a loan is considered substandard if  in the opinion of management  there are potential deficiencies which could result in the loan becoming inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution could sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses that are present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
loans classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that to continue to report them as loans without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
the bank s loan classification system is consistent with the classification system prescribed by the ots 
when loans are classified as either substandard or doubtful  a portion of the allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management is allocated as either a specific reserve or a general reserve against such loans 
specific reserves represent an allocation of the allowance against specific credits where a deficiency in collateral value or cash flow exists 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information  including the recognition of cash basis interest income 
all other substandard or doubtful loans receive an allocation of a general reserve 
general reserves represent a portion of the allowance for loan losses which has been allocated to recognize the inherent risk associated with these loans 
when loans are classified as loss  a specific allowance for the loss is established equal to of the amount of the loan and a charge off is subsequently taken for such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its loans and the amount of its allocated reserves is subject to review by the ots  which can require the establishment of additional reserves if in disagreement with the institution 
the following table summarizes webster s classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss  including nonperforming loans at december  and commercial business total residential banking specialized cre consumer december  substandard accruing     nonaccruing      total substandard      doubtful accruing nonaccruing   total doubtful   loss total      classified as a percent of loans commercial business total residential banking specialized cre consumer december  substandard accruing    nonaccruing     total substandard     doubtful accruing nonaccruing   total doubtful   loss total      classified as a percent of loans includes middle market  small business banking and lease financing 
the increase of million in classified loans can generally be attributed to the impact of the slowdown in the economy during the year 
this increase occurred primarily in two portfolios  a million increase in classified specialized loans  accruing interest  and of the million increase in classified business banking loans  are accruing interest 
improvements were achieved in the residential  consumer and cre portfolios 
classified loans as a percent of total loans increased to from the prior year 
classified as a percentage of loans in the specialized portfolio increased to at december  from at december  due to the national economic slowdown 
business banking loans increased to from the prior year 
because webster believes that early identification and management of problem loans serves to minimize future losses  it employs a rigorous portfolio review and management process  which identifies deteriorating credit risk and proactively manages problem loans 
for example  of the million in the specialized portfolio classified as substandard and accruing  million were not classified as such by sncp 
at december   million of nonperforming loans excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings were included in the classified loan total 
the remaining classified loans of million continued to perform in accordance with their contractual terms and to accrue interest 
under the definition of substandard above  these loans are considered by management to be potential problem loans 
allowance for loan losses methodology the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated by management to provide adequately for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
probable losses are estimated based upon a quarterly review of the loan portfolio  past loss experience  specific problem loans  economic conditions and other pertinent factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
in assessing the specific risks inherent in the portfolio  management takes into consideration the risk of loss on nonaccrual loans  classified loans and watch list loans including an analysis of the collateral for such loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management considers the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy  consistent with the sec s financial release concerning critical accounting policies 
as such  the adequacy of allowance for loan losses is subject to judgement in its determination 
actual loan losses could differ materially from management s calculation if actual loss factors and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized by management 
these factors and conditions include the general economic conditions within connecticut and nationally  trends within industries where the loan portfolio is concentrated  real estate values  interest rates and the financial condition of individual borrowers 
while management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december   actual results may prove different and these differences could be significant 
webster s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements 
the loan portfolio is segmented into pools of loans that are similar in type and risk characteristic 
these homogeneous pools are tracked over time and historic delinquency  nonaccrual and loss information is collected and analyzed 
in addition  problem loans are identified and analyzed individually on a periodic basis to detect specific probable losses 
webster collects industry delinquency  nonaccrual and loss data for the same portfolio segments for comparison purposes 
webster analyzes the data and estimates probable losses in the portfolio by calculating formula allowances for homogeneous pools of loans and classified loans and specific allowances for impaired loans 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loan pools and certain unused commitments  based on historic default and loss rates  internal risk ratings  and other risk based characteristics 
changes in risk ratings  and other risk factors  from period to period for both performing and nonperforming loans affect the calculation of the formula allowance 
loss factors are based on webster s loss experience  and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
webster considers the following when determining probable losses o webster utilizes migration models  which track the dynamic business characteristics inherent in the specific portfolios 
the assumptions are updated periodically to match changes in the business cycle 
o pooled loan loss factors not individually graded loans are based on expected net charge offs 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature  such as residential and consumer loans 
o the loan portfolios are characterized by historical statistics such as default rates  cure rates  loss in event of default rates and internal risk ratings 
o webster statistically evaluates the impact of larger concentrations in the commercial loan portfolio 
o comparable industry charge off statistics by line of business  broadly defined as residential  consumer  home equity and second mortgages  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending  are utilized as factors in calculating loss estimates in the loan portfolios 
o actual losses by portfolio segment are reviewed to validate estimated future probable losses 
allowance for loan losses at december   webster s allowance for loan losses was million  or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares with an allowance for loan losses of million or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonaccrual loans at december  net charge offs for totaled million as compared to million for reflecting an increase in net charge offs of million  for the current period 
the increase was primarily the result of commercial and industrial net charge offs being million higher for the increase is primarily due to million of specialized lending charge offs and million of commercial loan charge offs 
three loan relationships accounted for million of the overall increase 
management performs its review of the loan portfolio  loan loss allowance and considers various factors when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
this review included the specialized lending portfolio and the additional risks inherent in this portfolio 
based upon this review  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio

unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on webster s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
recent financial accounting standards on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement changes financial reporting by requiring that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively 
webster does not expect any material impact on its financial statements when this statement is adopted 
on august   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
statement applies to all entities 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
under this statement  the liability is discounted and the accretion expense is recognized using the credit adjusted risk free interest rate in effect when the liability was initially recognized 
the fasb issued this statement to provide consistency for the accounting and reporting of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted 
webster does not expect any material impact on its financial statements when this statement is adopted 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
currently  the fasb has stated that the unidentifiable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of a bank or thrift including acquisitions of branches  where the fair value of the liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired  should continue to be accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions 
under statement  all of the intangible assets associated with branch acquisitions recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  would continue to be amortized  as in prior periods 
the fasb has announced that additional research will be performed to decide whether unidentifiable intangible assets recorded under statement should be accounted for similarly to goodwill under statement however  issuance of a final opinion with respect to this matter is not expected until the fourth quarter of webster adopted the provisions of statement effective july  and such adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
webster is required to adopt the provisions of statement effective january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continues to be amortized prior to the adoption of statement statement requires  upon adoption of statement  a company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of income 
finally  any unamortized negative goodwill existing at the date statement is adopted must be taken into income as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of the date of adoption  webster expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  unamortized unidentifiable intangible assets subject to the provisions of statement of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and for the year ended december   amortization expense related to goodwill was million  to identifiable intangibles was million and to statement unidentifiable intangible assets was million 
while our transitional impairment analysis is not complete  management does not expect any significant transitional impairment losses 
absent any impairment losses  it is estimated at this time that diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year will be favorably impacted by approximately 
per share due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill 
impairment losses  if any  whether transitional or subsequent to adoption of statement  may offset some or all of this favorable impact 
identifiable intangibles  such as core deposit intangibles  have continued to be amortized and recognized as an expense 
taxation deferred tax asset  net at december   webster s net deferred tax asset approximated million  including a valuation allowance of approximately million for state tax benefits that  in management s current estimate  will not be realized 
management believes that webster will generate sufficient taxable income in future years to fully realize the net deferred tax asset  however  there can be no absolute assurance that webster will generate any specific level of future taxable income 
the company has sufficient taxable income currently and in carryback periods to expect full realization of its net deferred tax asset 
management considers the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to be a critical accounting policy  consistent with the sec s financial release on critical accounting policies 
as such  the determination of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is subject to judgement 
the actual realization of the assets could differ materially from that recognized in the consolidated financial statements if actual factors and conditions differ from those used by management 
these factors and conditions include federal and state tax laws and regulations and future levels of webster taxable income 
federal income tax legislation certain legislation enacted during august eliminated the thrift bad debt method of calculating bad debt deductions after  required the recapture into taxable income of certain post bad debt reserves  and provided for more limited circumstances in which certain pre bad debt reserves would be recaptured 
webster had previously recorded a deferred tax liability for the post reserves  and its total tax expense for financial reporting purposes was not affected by the legislation 
webster s pre reserves at both december  and were approximately million  and it does not expect such reserves to be recaptured into taxable income 
state income tax legislation during may  the state of connecticut enacted tax legislation effective in allowing for the formation of a passive investment company pic by a financial service company fsc 
the legislation exempts a pic from connecticut taxation and also exempts dividends paid from a pic to a related  qualified fsc from connecticut tax 
webster bank  a qualified fsc under the legislation  organized a pic that began operation during the first quarter of the pic reduced webster s connecticut tax expense beginning with tax year and a deferred tax charge was taken in as a result of its formation 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from management expectations  projections and estimates 
factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  legislative and regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  changes in tax policies  rates and regulations of federal  state and local tax authorities  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  the cost of funds  demand for loan products  demand for financial services  competition  changes in the quality or composition of webster s loan and investment portfolios  changes in accounting principles  policies or guidelines  and other economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting webster s operations  markets  products services and prices 
such developments  or any combination thereof  could have an adverse impact on webster s financial position and results of operations
