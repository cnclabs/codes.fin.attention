item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview our continuing operations experienced a decrease in revenue of approximately million  or  to approximately million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a recession in the general economy in the second half of  which lead to a reduced demand for contract services 
our operating income loss decreased approximately million  or  in the year ended december  over the prior year period  from a profit of approximately million in fiscal to a loss of approximately million in fiscal such decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased revenues discussed earlier and to higher selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included in costs and expenses is approximately million of impaired goodwill charges  as more fully described below 
our operations  including our contract placement  permanent placement and it training business  were consolidated within the it staffing segment in january to enable financial analysis that more closely tracks our lines of business 
previously  we also operated another segment through our information management solutions ims business 
during  we sold substantially all of the assets of the ims business for total consideration of approximately million consisting of cash  note receivable  and forgiveness of amounts payable to the buyer 
assets sold consisted primarily of accounts receivable  inventory  and property and equipment 
liabilities assumed by the buyer consisted primarily of trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  and equipment leases payable 
we incurred a loss on disposition of the ims business of approximately million net of tax effect of million 
included in such loss was the write off of approximately million of goodwill representing the unamortized balance of goodwill recorded in when we purchased all or substantially all of the business of three ims companies 
also included in such loss was an estimated loss for operations during the phase out period of approximately million for the remaining business  which was sold in august operating results of the ims business for the year ended december  are shown separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net revenues of the ims business for the year ended december  was approximately million 
revenues our contract placement revenues are derived from professional service activities  primarily the placement of skilled it  engineering  pharmaceutical  scientific  biotechnical and other professional personnel whose work is billed at an hourly rate 
an engagement of our technical consultants typically lasts from six to months 
revenues are directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
hourly billing rates are established for each technical consultant based on the technical consultant s skills  experience and the type of work performed 
for the year ended december   total hours billed were  with an average billing rate of  compared to total hours billed of  with an average billing rate of for the prior year period 
we believe that the decrease in the total hours billed for our technical consultants resulted from lower demand for our services due to the recession in the general economy in the second half of cost of sales in the contract placement business consists primarily of the compensation expenses related to the consultants  such as salaries  fringe benefits and payroll taxes 
selling and operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and fringe benefits for selling representatives  and also include marketing expenditures and bad debt charges 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative salaries and related fringe benefits  as well as other overhead  such as rent and depreciation 
our permanent placement revenues are generated from one time fees received upon successful placements of it  food processing  pharmaceutical  distribution  retail  and biotechnical professional and engineering personnel with clients 
the standard fee arrangement is of each thousand dollars of salary  up to a maximum of of the professional s first year salary 
revenue is recognized upon commencement of the employment  subject to reversal if employment terminates during a guarantee period typically days 
the permanent placement business placed approximately  professionals with an average placement fee of  in  compared to approximately  professionals placed with an average placement fee of  for the prior year period 
the decrease in placements was primarily attributable to lower demand for professionals due to the recession in the general economy in the second half of the increase in average placement fee was primarily attributable to our emphasis on higher salary placements in the food processing  distribution and pharmaceutical industries 
no cost of sales is recorded in the permanent placement business 
our it training business provides training in a variety of software and network applications 
tuition and fee revenues are recognized when the classes are held 
payments received prior to the class commencing are recorded as deferred revenues 
the it training business provides its services at our facility in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania and at various off site locations 
we frequently conduct our courses at the in house facilities of our corporate clients and have the ability to provide the necessary computer equipment at conference centers  hotels and other off site locations as requested by our clients 
business strategy our business objectives are to increase market share in existing markets by offering our services to additional industries  such as our expansion into the distribution  pharmaceutical and biotechnical industries  to increase cross selling opportunities by offering all of our services in each location  and to continue to strengthen our market position  by expansion through internal growth 
we continue to pursue cost controls by reevaluating our current operating practices to find ways to improve the productivity of our personnel 
in we continued a focused strategic planning and budgeting process resulting in a internal operating plan that reflects lower revenues in view of the continuing recession in the general economy  while continuing to lower costs accordingly 
however  this plan is subject to many factors and contingencies  and we may not be able to realize our goals 
if we are able to achieve our internal operating plan  which relies upon certain assumptions including  but not limited to  our ability to maintain strict cost controls in all of our operating units  we believe we can achieve earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization of approximately of our revenues 
failure to achieve the aforementioned assumptions as well as other factors could prevent us from achieving these goals  which are forward looking statements

the interest rate on our line of credit increased from at december  to at december   partially offsetting the decreased total interest expense

 accounting for income taxes

 dollars in thousands net revenues         gross profit         operating income loss        net income loss     basic and diluted net income loss per share because we derive revenue in our contract placement business only when our consultants are actually working  our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when our clients facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
during the quarters ended december  and  the number of holidays and vacation days slightly affected revenues in the contract placement business 
in addition  as companies approached the yk turnover they postponed some non yk projects  which was reflected in decreased revenues during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded non recurring charges for severance costs related to two former executives 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded non cash charges to write off impaired goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources we have used borrowings under our credit facility to fund our working capital needs as our business has expanded 
we utilize a cash management program to minimize non earning cash assets  including a zero balance disbursement account as reflected in the balance of in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we provided cash from operating activities in of approximately million compared to approximately million provided in  and approximately million in in a large portion of our net loss was caused by non cash charges  which helped to offset a decrease in accounts payable of million  a use of funds 
the primary source of cash from operating activities in was the collection of million of accounts receivable 
in the cash provided from operating activities primarily reflects our net income of approximately million 
our net loss in consisted of large non cash charges  which also helped offset an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable  both of which are uses of funds 
cash purchases of fixed assets for the fiscal years ended december    and were million  million  and million respectively 
in we financed the purchase of million of equipment by entering into capital lease obligations 
these purchases were related primarily to the purchases of computers  software  and imaging equipment to upgrade our technology infrastructure 
we plan to spend approximately million for capital expenditures in in we received approximately million in cash proceeds from the disposition of our ims business 
we repaid  net of borrowings  approximately million of our line of credit at december   compared to net repayments of approximately million in and approximately million at december  at december  we had approximately million outstanding in connection with our overdraft facility compared to approximately million outstanding at december  and approximately million at december  such overdrafts represent the amount of checks we issued prior to being funded by our line of credit through the zero balance disbursement account discussed above 
we repaid approximately million of our long term debt in the year ended december  compared to approximately million each in the periods ended december  and in the year ended december  we paid approximately million related to our guarantee that common shares issued in connection with two of our acquisitions would equal or exceed a specified price at the anniversary date of the issuance  compared to approximately million in the year ended december  we repurchased  shares of our common stock  for approximately million  in the year ended december   in market transactions at prices ranging from to per share  which stock is considered treasury stock 
in the year ended december   we completed a sale lease back of certain of our fixed assets with an affiliate of pnc bank  na the lease obligation was approximately million repayable in equal monthly rental payments 
since april  we have had available a revolving advance facility  the line of credit  with pnc bank  na  the bank 
the line of credit expires on april  this facility allows us to borrow the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable  or million 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding against the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains customary restrictive covenants which from time to time have been reset by the bank  including limitations on loans we may extend to officers and employees  the incurrence of additional debt and the payment of dividends on our common shares 
the line of credit bears interest  at the company s option  at either the bank s prime rate  which was at december   or basis points over the london inter bank offering rate 
a continued recession in the united states economy at large could potentially lead to further decreases in our revenue in future periods 
while no one customer represents greater than of our total revenue  a continuing general economic recession in the united states could adversely impact our clients and cause them to further curtail the use of staffing services 
our management continues to monitor general economic conditions and expects to make adjustments to our operations as needed 
we anticipate that our primary uses of capital in future periods will be to fund increases in accounts receivable  to support internal growth by financing new offices  and to finance additional acquisitions 
we believe that our line of credit  or other credit facilities  which may be available to us in the future  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations payable in the future  in the respective periods in which they are due payments due by period contractual cash less than obligations total one year years years after years long term debt including capital lease obligations    note payable  bank   operating leases     total     note payable  bank consists of advances under a line of credit facility expiring april  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and bad debts  intangible assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debts we record permanent placement revenue at the date employment of the placed professional commences  net of an allowance for estimated adjustments during the guarantee period 
we record revenues related to temporary placement services on a weekly basis as the services are performed 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill we have recorded goodwill related to various acquisitions we made in we record an impairment charge when we believe an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the acquired business could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of goodwill that may not be reflected in the current carrying value  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
inflation we do not believe that the rates of inflation prevailing in the united states in recent years have had a significant effect on our operations 
forward looking information this report and other reports and statements filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission collectively  sec filings contain or may contain certain forward looking statements and information that are based on beliefs of  and information currently available to  our management as well as estimates and assumptions made by our management 
when used in sec filings  and in oral statements by us the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management  identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations and results of operations  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of the industries served by us  and other risks and uncertainties  including  in addition to any uncertainties specifically identified in the text surrounding such statements and those identified below  uncertainties with respect to changes or developments in social  economic  business  industry  market  legal and regulatory circumstances and conditions and actions taken or omitted to be taken by third parties  including our shareholders  customers  suppliers  business partners  competitors  and legislative  regulatory  judicial and other governmental authorities and officials 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated  believed  estimated  expected  intended or planned 
dependence on availability of qualified technical consultants 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain technical consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
to keep pace with rapidly evolving information technologies and changing client needs  we must continually evaluate and upgrade our database of available qualified technical consultants 
competition for individuals with proven technical skills is intense  and  as is currently customary in the industry  we do not have any exclusive contracts with our consultants 
we compete for such individuals with other providers of technical staffing services  systems integrators  providers of outsourcing services  computer systems consultants  clients and temporary personnel agencies 
factors influencing such competition include compensation  benefits  growth opportunities and pre existing relationships with other companies  particularly specialty staffing companies 
as we expand into new geographic areas  we may experience difficulty attracting qualified technical consultants who have a prior relationship or familiarity with more established specialty staffing companies in such areas 
there can be no assurance that qualified technical consultants will continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers to meet our current and anticipated growth requirements 
ability to manage growth 
although our internal operating plan forecasts that we will have lower revenues in  if we achieve sustained or significant growth  we will subject ourselves to risks by placing a substantial strain our available managerial  sales  recruiting  financial and other resources 
specifically  such growth will require us to i hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing markets as well as markets in which we have no prior operating experience  ii develop and maintain relationships with an increasingly large number of highly qualified technical consultants  iii maintain cost controls in all of our businesses  and iv apply our management practices to a significantly larger organization 
expansion beyond the geographic areas where our offices are presently located will further increase demands on our management 
our ability to manage our staff and facilities growth effectively will require us to continue to expand our operational  financial and other internal systems 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures and controls will be successfully implemented or adequate to support our expanded operations 
furthermore  an element of our business strategy is to cross sell the existing services of our businesses to new and existing clients 
historically  these businesses have operated independently  producing only occasional referrals  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully market such services on an integrated basis 
in addition  if the technology sector of the economy continues a downturn  we could be affected more so than other businesses 
dependence on contract placement business 
our contract placement business was responsible for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  for the year ended  one customer of the contract placement business  merck company  inc  accounted for approximately of total contract placement revenues  and of our total revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain this level of revenue from this client 
our ability to sustain or increase revenues in the contract placement business is subject to various factors  including our ability to attract and retain qualified technical consultants  to hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing and new markets  to apply our management practices to a significantly larger organization and to consummate acquisitions of and to successfully integrate profitable staffing companies 
our inability to successfully manage these factors would have a material adverse effect on the revenues of the contract placement business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase our contract placement revenues 
furthermore  a decline in the level of contract placement revenues would have a material adverse effect on us 
risk of nasdaq delisting 
there are several requirements that we must satisfy in order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  maintaining a minimum per share price of our common stock of one dollar and a minimum aggregate market value of publicly held shares mvphs of our common stock of  we have received notification from the nasdaq stock market  inc that our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market unless the stock closes at or above one dollar per share for at least ten consecutive days by may  the per share price of our common stock and the mvphs of our common stock do not currently satisfy requirements to remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
in addition  in the future we may not comply with other listing requirements  which might result in the delisting of our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  we may list the common stock for trading over the counter or apply to have the common stock listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  subject to nasdaq s approval 
delisting from the nasdaq national market could adversely affect the liquidity and the price of our common stock and could have a long term adverse impact on our ability to raise future capital through a sale of our common stock 
in addition  delisting could make it more difficult for investors to obtain quotations or trade our common stock 
acquisition risks 
we from time to time evaluate the possible acquisition of companies that will complement and expand our existing businesses  principally in new geographic markets 
the successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire such companies on suitable terms and integrate their operations with ours 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that  if identified  we will be able to acquire such companies on suitable terms 
the specialty staffing industry is relatively mature 
acquisitions in this industry are therefore likely to be at higher relative prices than for other industries due to competition from other staffing companies for acquisition candidates 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  including i adverse effects on our reported operating results  including interest expense  ii diversion of management attention  iii risks associated with unanticipated problems  liabilities or contingencies  iv difficulties and higher than expected costs related to the integration of the acquired business  and v dilution of existing shareholders 
the occurrence of some or all of the events described in these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
subsequent events on or about february  we received notification from the nasdaq stock market  inc that our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market unless the stock closes at or above one dollar per share for at least ten consecutive days by may  the per share price of our common stock and the mvphs of our common stock do not currently satisfy requirements to remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
in addition  in the future we may not comply with other listing requirements  which might result in the delisting of our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  we may list the common stock for trading over the counter or apply to have the common stock listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  subject to nasdaq s approval 
delisting from the nasdaq national market could adversely affect the liquidity and the price of our common stock and could have a long term adverse impact on our ability to raise future capital through a sale of our common stock 
in addition  delisting could make it more difficult for investors to obtain quotations or trade our common stock 
on february   we announced the commencement of a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  employees holding options to purchase our common stock were given an opportunity to exchange certain of their existing options  with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share  for new options 
employees will receive one new option for every three eligible options surrendered 
we expect the new options to be granted on or about september  the new options will vest over four years 
the exercise price of the new options will be the last reported trading price of our common stock on their grant date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk due to the variable interest rates on our line of credit discussed above 
the interest rates vary primarily due to changes in short term interest rates promulgated by the federal reserve bank in its efforts to control general economic conditions 
during  the federal reserve bank caused such interest rates to decline  and further rate decreases would likely decrease our interest cost 
assuming our indebtedness under our line of credit is approximately million  and we continue to have approximately  common shares outstanding  a decrease in our interest rate will increase our annual earnings per share by less than cent 
correspondingly a increase in our interest rate will decrease our annual earnings per share by less than cent 
we have not entered into derivative financial or commodity instrument transactions 
we do not believe that our exposure to market risk from other types of financial instruments  such as accounts receivable and accounts payable  is material
