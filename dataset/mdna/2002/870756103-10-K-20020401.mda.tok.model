overview see summary of significant accounting policies note to the financial statements for discussion of accounting standards not yet adopted by the company 
swift s fleet has been predominantly comprised of company owned and leased tractors 
the company s decisions whether to buy or lease new and replacement revenue equipment are based upon the overall economic impact of the alternative financing methods  including market prices available and income tax considerations 
depending on whether revenue equipment is purchased or leased  several categories of the company s operating expenses have varied  and will continue to vary  as a percentage of the company s revenues 
because of the impact that equipment financing methods can have on the operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  the company believes that the most meaningful comparative measure of its operating efficiency is its pre tax margin earnings before income taxes as a percentage of operating revenue  which takes into consideration both the company s total operating expenses and net interest expense as a percentage of operating revenue 
accordingly  in the discussion and analysis below  the company has focused on the factors contributing to operating revenue increases and to the increase or decrease in its pre tax margin during the periods presented 
in the forward looking statements that may be included herein  important factors such as the financial position of the company  its customers needs  the cost of new equipment and new construction  the availability of buyers in the marketplace  fuel costs and other factors may cause actual results to vary 
management believes the industry trend towards financially stable core carriers will continue and result in continued industry consolidation 
in response to this trend  the company continues to expand its total fleet with  tractors as of december  compared to  tractors as of december  see business general 
during this same period  the company s owner operator fleet has expanded to  as of december  from  as of december  this fleet growth was accomplished through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions

net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the previous year 
the increase in operating revenue is due primarily to the expansion of the company s total fleet to  tractors at december  from  at december   an increase of tractors  and an increase in revenue per loaded mile of 
revenues for the year ended december  were affected by the transfer of our logistics business to transplace

the company s empty mile factor was and and the average loaded linehaul revenue per mile was and excluding fuel surcharge for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries  wages and employee benefits represented of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the increase is primarily due to a larger percentage of company trucks in the total fleet  a greater number of empty miles and the impact of reduced utilization on an increased dedicated business with fixed pay driver wages 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding rate increases were not obtained 
operating supplies represented and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in operating supplies is primarily attributable to increased on road operating expenses such as maintenance and tolls  merger related costs  and the writeoff of  advances to easo 
fuel expenses represented and of operating revenue in and  respectively 
the decrease in fuel as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to decreased fuel prices 
increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
management believes that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available

exclusive of gains  which reduced rental expense  the percentage of rental expense to operating revenue in and was and  respectively 
insurance and claims expense represented and of operating revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year ended december  includes a million increase to ms carriers insurance and claims reserves and million of increased insurance premiums over the prior year  approximately of operating revenue 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to auto liability claims and an increase in losses from cargo thefts 
the company s insurance program for liability  physical damage and cargo damage involves self insurance with varying risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk retention levels are covered by insurance in amounts which management considers adequate 
the company accrues the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period  changes in claims development trends and insurance premium rate increases 
the company experienced increases in insurance premium rates in and expects further increases in such rates in depreciation and amortization expense was of operating revenue for the years ended december  and during the year ended december  the company recorded gains on the sale of revenue equipment of approximately million compared with approximately million in exclusive of gains  which reduced depreciation and amortization expense  the percentage of depreciation and amortization to operating revenue was in and interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was due to lower interest rates and decreased borrowings under the company s line of credit  long term debt and capital leases  offset by the million market adjustment for derivatives 
other expense for the year ended december  includes the million adjustment for the impairment of the equity investment held by ms carriers in transportes easo  and the equity loss of million for transplace 
the combined impact of this adjustment and equity loss is a increase in other expenses as a percentage of operating revenue

the company s empty mile factor was and and the average loaded linehaul revenue per mile was and excluding fuel surcharge for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries  wages and employee benefits represented of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the increase is due to a significant driver wage increase by ms carriers in march and lower logistics revenue as a result of the transfer to transplace 
partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in the accrual for the company s k profit sharing contribution and an increase in the portion of revenues generated by owner operators 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding rate increases were not obtained

when it is economically feasible to do so  the company will purchase then sell tractors it leases by exercising the purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rent expense

insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
depreciation and amortization expense was and of operating revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december  the company recorded gains on the sale of revenue equipment of approximately million compared with approximately million in exclusive of gains  which reduced depreciation and amortization expense  the percentage of depreciation and amortization to operating revenue was in and interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was due to increased borrowings under the company s lines of credit  an increase in capital leases and increased proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program 
liquidity and capital resources the continued growth in the company s business requires significant investment in new revenue equipment  upgraded and expanded facilities  and enhanced computer hardware and software 
the funding for this expansion has been from cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of revenue equipment  long term debt  borrowings on the company s line of credit  proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization  the use of leases to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment and from periodic public offerings of common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to increases in depreciation and amortization  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and claims accruals and a decrease in accounts receivable offset by a decrease in net earnings and a smaller increase in deferred taxes 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
as of december   the company had commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment for approximately million 
the company has the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
the company believes it will be able to support these acquisitions of revenue equipment through debt and lease financings and cash flows generated by operating activities 
during the year ended december   the company incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities and equipment 
the company anticipates that it will expend approximately million in for various facilities upgrades and acquisition and development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
the funding for capital expenditures has been and will be from a combination of cash provided by operating activities  amounts available under the company s line of credit  accounts receivable securitization  and debt and lease financing 
the availability of capital for revenue equipment and other capital expenditures will be affected by prevailing market conditions and the company s financial condition and results of operations 
net cash used provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to reduced proceeds under the accounts receivable securitization and increased repayments of long term debt  offset by reduced treasury stock purchases and proceeds from the sale of company stock through the stock purchase and option plans and the company s public stock offering completed in 
management believes that it will be able to finance its needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases 
over the long term  the company will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require the company to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon the company s financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock and other factors over which the company has little or no control 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season 
the company s operating expenses also tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to successfully provide truckload carrier services to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
general economic and business factors 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  license and registration fees and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and owner operators 
the company s results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail  manufacturing and paper products in which the company has a concentration of customers 
in addition  the company s results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and the company s operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
competition 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with railroads 
competition has created downward pressure on the truckload industry s pricing structure 
there are some trucking companies with which the company competes that have greater financial resources than the company  and one may own more revenue equipment and carry a larger volume of freight than the company 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
the company depends on cash from operations  operating leases and debt financing for funds to expand the size of its fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
if the company were unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it would have to limit its growth and might be required to operate its revenue equipment for longer periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
acquisitions 
the growth of the company has been dependent in part upon the acquisition of trucking companies throughout the united states 
to date  the company has been successful in identifying trucking companies to acquire and in integrating such companies operations into the company s operations 
the company may face competition from transportation companies or other third parties for acquisition opportunities that become available 
there can be no assurance that the company will identify acquisition candidates that will result in successful combinations in the future 
any future acquisitions by the company may result in the incurrence of additional debt  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  or could involve the potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the acquired company s operations particularly in the period immediately following the consummation of such transactions  the diversion of the attention of the company s management from other business  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
merger with ms carriers 
the company may be unable to fully realize the cost savings and operating synergies that are expected to result from its acquisition of ms carriers 
specifically  the company may not fully realize anticipated cost savings and synergies resulting from efficiencies in tractor and trailer utilization  economies of scale in purchasing power  increased operations in mexico  cross marketing opportunities among major customers  and unified recruitment of drivers and owner operators 
to the extent the company is unable to realize anticipated cost savings and operating synergies  its stock price may be adversely affected 
in addition  the company may encounter difficulties in operating the combined company that could have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition  or prospects 
as a result of the acquisition  the company may experience difficulty in i maintaining freight volume with customers that historically have done business with both swift and ms carriers who may wish to decrease the concentration of their business with the combined company  ii maintaining customer service and equipment utilization standards while attempting to more efficiently use the tractors  trailers  and physical locations of the combined company  and iii obtaining sufficient freight at rates that will support historical margins and permit the combined company to maintain historical growth rates 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of mr 
jerry moyes  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  mr 
william f 
riley  iii  senior executive vice president and chief financial officer  mr 
rodney k 
sartor  executive vice president  mr 
patrick j 
farley  executive vice president  mr 
kevin h 
jensen  executive vice president  mr 
michael s 
starnes  president of ms carriers  mr 
james w 
welch  senior vice president of ms carriers  and mr 
m j barrow  senior vice president of ms carriers 
mr 
moyes has other significant business interests to which he devotes his time and efforts  including serving as chairman of simon transportation services  inc  a truckload carrier providing nationwide  predominately temperature controlled transportation services for major shippers  and central freight lines  inc  a regional less than truckload carrier 
mr 
moyes is also the largest stockholder of simon transportation and central freight lines 
although the company believes it has an experienced and talented management group  the loss of the services of mr 
moyes  mr 
riley  mr 
sartor  mr 
farley  mr 
jensen  mr 
starnes  mr 
welch or mr 
barrrow could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and future profitability 
the company does not have employment agreements with nor does it maintain key man life insurance on messrs 
riley  sartor  farley  or jensen 
the company does not have an employment agreement with but does maintain key man life insurance on mr 
moyes 
the company has employment agreements with messrs 
starnes  welch and barrow  which were entered into in connection with the merger with ms carriers  but does not maintain key man life insurance on any of them 
the employment agreement with mr 
starnes expires june   and the employment agreement with messrs 
welch and barrow expires on june  regulation 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation 
this regulatory authority exercises broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
swift may also become subject to new or more comprehensive or restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics and limitations on hours of service 
the increased cost of complying with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
in addition  the company s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of stormwater and underground fuel storage tanks 
if the company should be involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if the company were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
used equipment market 
swift relies on the sale of used equipment to offset the cost of purchasing new equipment 
in the past two years  used tractor values have deteriorated significantly 
should this trend continue  it could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
claims exposure  insurance 
the company currently self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury and property damage  and maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above its limits on self insurance 
to the extent the company were to experience an increase in the number of claims for which it is self insured  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases  would reduce the company s profitability 
dependence on key customers 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from key customers 
during  the company s top  and customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
the company does not have long term contractual relationships with many of its key customers  and there can be no assurance that the company s relationships with its key customers will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of the company s services by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s line of credit  revolving notes  equipment loan  approximately million of capital lease obligations and accounts receivable securitization  all of which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its mix of variable rate debt  fixed rate lease financing and million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the company s long term debt approximates carrying values 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by million
