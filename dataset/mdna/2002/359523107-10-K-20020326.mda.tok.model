item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech nv the company operates primarily in the air pollution control business 
it distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
principal markets for its products are stationary combustion sources that produce nitrogen oxide nox and other emissions 
the company sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
the company currently generates revenues from the following two product lines nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies the company markets several nox reduction technologies to meet statutory nox reduction requirements worldwide 
the near term driver for growth in this business is the ozone transport sip state implementation plan call  which requires states to decrease their nox emissions by may  this regulation impacts utility boilers and large industrial boilers see below for more detail on the sip call 
fuel treatment chemicals the company s proprietary targeted in furnace injection technology centers around the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the performance of combustion units 
specifically  this technology is used to reduce slag formation  corrosion and opacity in boilers  furnaces and incinerators 
the company believes its largest market opportunity for this product line is those units burning western coals  many of which have significant operational issues related to the formation of slag 
fuel tech first penetrated this market in through the successful demonstration of this technology on a large utility boiler burning western coal and  based on this success  expects to further penetrate this market in versus net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  a decline of 
this overall decline is due to a  year on year reduction in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenues  the basis of which is discussed further below 
this result was partially offset by two favorable factors 
first  the company experienced a  increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues in versus  to a record level of  second  the company realized revenues from temperature mapping and modeling activities predominantly for the domestic nox reduction utility project business in the amount of approximately  in versus an immaterial amount in the year on year decline in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenues is attributable to a nox reduction regulation  as mandated in title iii of the clean air act amendments of caaa  requiring municipal solid waste incinerators to significantly reduce their nox emissions by december  this regulation had a significant positive impact on industrial project revenues in  and it was expected that these revenues would not repeat in nox reduction utility revenue had been negatively impacted by the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the environmental protection agency s epa sip call regulation 
as discussed further below  the uncertainty regarding this regulation has been lifted and the company expects demand for its nox reduction technologies to increase significantly during the next few years 
the increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues is attributable to the company s success in penetrating the market for utility units burning western coals  and to customers conversion from existing suppliers to fuel tech 
significant focus has been placed on marketing the company s patented targeted in furnace injection approach to reducing the operating costs of customers units 
the succesful penetration of the market for utility units burning western coals will serve as the primary driver for revenue growth in this business in the upcoming years 
the sip call is the federal mandate that  when introduced in  required states to reduce nox emissions by may this mandate was an extension of phase ii of title i of the caaa 
in may a stay was imposed on this regulation 
on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
subsequent to this court ruling  the stay on the sip call was lifted 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back one year to may of  nineteen states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by october of these plans  which the epa had until october to approve  will potentially impact to utility boilers and to large industrial units 
in february  the united states supreme court  in a unanimous decision  upheld epa s authority to revise the national ambient air quality standard for ozone to parts per million averaged through an eight hour period from the current parts per million for a one hour period 
this more stringent standard provides clarity and impetus for air pollution control efforts well beyond the current ozone attainment requirement of in keeping with this trend  the supreme court  only days later  denied industry s attempt to again stay the sip call  effectively exhausting all means of appeal 
based on these regulatory developments  the company is enjoying accelerated interest in its programs that have led to significant project bookings late in and early in  the company realized approximately  in revenues from temperature mapping and modeling orders received on boilers predominantly for the domestic nox reduction utility project business 
the company s performance of temperature mapping and modeling work for a customer is the precursor to performing nox reduction project installations on the units for which the mapping and modeling has been performed 
it is the company s belief that project orders will be received from the majority of customers for whom temperature mapping and modeling work has been performed 
the gross margin percentage on an overall basis across all products was in  compared with in the improvement was realized primarily due to the increase in revenues in the fuel treatment chemical business 
as nox reduction revenues from utility companies in the united states increase due to the above mentioned regulations  this business will comprise a much larger percentage of the company s overall revenues 
as a result  the company expects that the overall gross margin percentages will decline over the next several years  reflecting the change in product mix 
it should be noted  however  that gross margin dollars are expected to increase significantly in due to the expected increase in revenues in both the nox control and fuel treatment chemical businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase is due primarily to a higher level of selling and service expenses resulting from the increased agents fees and commissions for the us fuel treatment chemical business  and to a lesser extent to an increase in expenses related to the enhancement and expansion of the company s european business 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the company continues to aggressively pursue commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  with a particular focus on its noxout ultra tm process and its virtual vantage tm advanced visualization software 
the company sold its first commercial demonstration of noxout ultra late in  and expects additional demonstration orders in version of the virtual vantage software is expected to be released late in the second quarter of  but the company does not expect to realize significant revenues from this product before the company recorded a net loss from its equity interest in affiliates during the year of  this amount consists of a  loss recognized on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  and a  loss on its investment in fuel tech cs gmbh 
the company has a common stock ownership interest in cdt as of december   while the company has a ownership interest in fuel tech cs gmbh as noted above 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of related party transactions 
interest expense decreased to  for the twelve month period ended december  from  for the same period in the favorable variance is due solely to the decrease in the average outstanding principal debt balance during the year  and to a decrease in short term interest rates 
other income and expense for the twelve month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in the decrease is due to a lower level of interest income that was driven by the decrease in short term interest rates noted above  and to the write down of impaired assets 
partially offsetting these factors was a gain in the amount of approximately  related to the dissolution of the wholly owned subsidiaries in poland and taiwan 
the entity in poland has not been operational since  and the entity in taiwan operated only as a sales agency office 
the company recorded a tax benefit of  in related to the italian subsidiary 
there were no domestic income taxes recorded in as the company recorded a net loss for the year 
the company has million in united states federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in the company s balance sheet 
in the opinion of management  the company s expected near term revenue growth in its nox reduction business will be directly related to the implementation of the requirements of the caaa 
the company s implementor and alliance strategies will enable the company to provide the noxout process to an increasing number of customers without significantly adding technical and support staff 
customers purchase the noxout process and related technologies from either the company or its implementors 
if customers purchase the noxout process from implementors  the per contract revenues to the company may be lower  but more installations may be handled 
versus net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  a decline of 
this overall decline was due primarily to a  year on year reduction in domestic nox reduction project revenue from utilities 
this result was somewhat offset by a increase in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenue  as particular emphasis was placed on this market segment while awaiting resolution of litigation concerning regulations affecting the domestic utility segment 
international nox reduction industrial project revenues in were behind by  with the decline being attributable to the closure of fuel tech gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company discussed further below and to the completion of a major project in asia in international project revenues were  however  supported by the continued maturation of the western european market  with new business attained in france and italy 
lastly  revenues derived from the sale of fuel treatment chemicals domestically and internationally fell short of levels by and  respectively 
domestically  the negative impact of high crude oil prices early in the year could not be completely overcome by year end gains resulting from the high price of natural gas causing boiler operators to switch fuels back to oil  and the penetration of the company s patented targeted in furnace injection technology 
the decline in international fuel treatment chemical revenues was primarily attributable to a large customer s change in fuels  thus eliminating their requirement for treatment chemicals 
the company believes that the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the environmental protection agency s epa sip call regulation  as discussed previously  was the primary reason for the decline in domestic nox reduction utility project revenue experienced in as noted above  sales in the domestic fuel treatment chemical segment increased during the latter part of  which resulted from the increase in the cost of natural gas that has caused customers to switch back to using fuel oil 
additionally  significant effort was being expended to further penetrate and enter the potentially lucrative pulp and paper and western coals markets 
the company directed its sales and marketing efforts toward the penetration of its patented targeted in furnace injection technology into these segments of the market  where the return on investment to the company s customers can reach in excess of per year 
the gross margin percentage on an overall basis across all products was in  compared with in the improvement was realized primarily due to the reduction in revenues realized from lower margin nox reduction utility projects in the united states in versus  and to the improved margin performance on nox reduction industrial projects 
the company s net income on a consolidated basis for the months ended december  included a net charge of  related to the restructure of its european operations in an effort to consolidate its business and enhance profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company announced that it would concentrate its european resources in its italian company  fuel tech srl  and shut down fuel tech gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary  in germany 
the restructuring consisted of the following transactions  which were recorded at june  fuel tech gmbh s noxout chemical business was sold to a new entity in germany fuel tech cs gmbh in which the company holds a ownership interest that was acquired for  the selling price is dependent on future results of the chemical business  but will not be less than  deutsche marks approximately  paid out over three years 
a gain on this transaction of  was recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
fuel tech gmbh recorded a charge of  related to the closure of the entity 
the charge included accruals of  primarily for severance obligations for four employees  lease termination costs and other costs related to the closure of the entity 
this charge was recorded as a reduction to operating income in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the company made payments of approximately  related to this charge 
the cumulative foreign currency translation loss related to fuel tech gmbh of  was recognized as other income and expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased by  from the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in revenue based expenses  such as sales commissions to employees and agents  and to a lesser extent  to reductions in controllable expenses 
the company recorded a net loss from its equity interest in affiliates during the year of  this amount consists of a  loss recognized on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  offset by a  gain on its investment in fuel tech cs gmbh 
the company had a common stock ownership interest in cdt as of december   while the company had a ownership interest in fuel tech cs gmbh as noted above 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of related party transactions 
interest expense increased to  for the twelve month period ended december  from  for the same period in the unfavorable variance is due solely to the increase in the average outstanding principal debt balance during the year 
a million term loan was received on september   and was used to retire a note held by nalco chemical company nalco  the company s former joint venture partner in nalco fuel tech nft  with a remaining principal balance of million and for the buyout of a contingent payment obligation held by nalco which had a maximum remaining obligation of million 
both obligations relate to the company s purchase of nalco s interest in nft in april other income and expense for the twelve month period ended december  was favorable versus the prior year by  higher levels of interest income driven by favorable cash balances and higher interest rates  as well as the impact of the german transactions discussed above provided the positive variance 
the company did not record the impact of income taxes in  while income tax expense of  was recorded in the company had million in united states federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december  the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in the company s balance sheet 
there was no income tax impact recorded in the results primarily due to recording the benefit of the net operating losses generated in prior years  which were carried forward and applied at the state level 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at december  versus million at december  operating activities  which provided million of cash in  were driven by the continued improvement in working capital management 
investing activities  which used cash of million during the year  were primarily comprised of a loan to cdt of  and to the continued investment in equipment and intellectual property of  financing activities  which used cash of  during the year  were comprised primarily of debt repayments of  which were offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options 
historically  the company has financed its operations principally through the private placement of its common shares and the private placement of nil coupon non redeemable convertible unsecured loan notes the loan notes 
the loan notes are convertible at any time into the company s common stock 
they bear no interest  have no maturity date and are repayable generally only in the event of the winding up of the company 
the company has therefore classified the loan notes within shareholders equity in its balance sheet 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of  respectively 
on september   fti entered into a million revolving credit facility expiring august   which is collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
fti can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
cash advances under this facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or at an optional rate that can be selected by fti which is based on the bank s interbank offering rate plus 
also  on september   fti entered into a term loan agreement with the same bank for a total principal balance of million 
the principal balance was to be repaid in quarterly installments of  commencing on december   with a final principal payment of  due on august  further  fti entered into an interest rate swap transaction that fixes the rate of interest at on approximately of the outstanding principal balance during the term of the loan 
the remaining principal balance bears interest at the bank s prime rate  or at an optional rate that can be selected by fti which is based on the bank s interbank offering rate plus 
the borrowings under this facility are collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
in  amendments to this debt agreement were approved to increase the line of credit to  and to extend the expiration date of both the line of credit and the term loan to january  further  on march  an additional amendment to the agreement required fti to maintain a  compensating balance in support of the debt facility  so long as credit is available and until the bank is repaid in full 
at december   the full outstanding balance of the term loan is classified as short term to reflect the fti s intent to repay or refinance this balance during the first six months of on favorable terms to the company  and also  uncertainty concerning fti s ability to comply with a debt covenant at september  the covenant for the period ended september  and beyond  which was negotiated in  does not reflect the deferral in nox reduction revenues the company experienced due to the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the sip call regulation 
under the terms of this agreement  fti is not allowed to make loans or advances  or remit annual dividends in excess of  to the company as long as the facility is outstanding 
at december   fti net assets subject to this restriction are  this restriction does not adversely impact the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
the company is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings against this facility and approximately  was available for utilization 
the carrying amount of debt approximates fair value at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap  based on quoted market prices  is a liability of  at december  the notional value of the swap is  at december  as a result of the aforementioned transactions  the pending regulatory deadlines in the united states and the current cash and working capital positions  the company believes that it will have sufficient resources to fund its growth and operations going forward 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual engineering hours and equipment construction costs incurred and total estimated hours and costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
forward looking information from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  product demand  pricing  market acceptance  litigation  risk of dependence on significant customers  third party suppliers and intellectual property rights  risks in product and technology development and other risk factors detailed in this annual report and in the company s securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
the company is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses an interest rate derivative instrument an interest rate swap to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap transaction that fixes the rate of interest at on approximately of the outstanding principal balance during the term of the loan 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
