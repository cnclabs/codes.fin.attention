results of operations in november  the company s board of directors decided to discontinue our uk operations 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of such discontinued operations are in liquidation 
the following information has been presented on a basis consistent with discontinued operations treatment 
accordingly  the operating results relating to the uk operations have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of fixed assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenues primarily from advertising and subscriptions 
advertising revenue  derived from the sale of sponsorship  banner and email advertisements on the company s web site  is recognized ratably in the period the advertising is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
although infrequent  company obligations could include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions or times that an advertisement is viewed by users of the company s web site 
such amounts are recognized as revenue in the month earned 
subscription revenues represent customer subscriptions that provide subscribers access to financial commentary  analysis and news 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are charged directly to companies that subscribe to the service 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
deferred revenue liabilities relate to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized 
other revenues consist primarily of barter transactions  content syndication fees  and conference related revenue 
revenues from barter transactions are recognized in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
eitf during the period in which the advertisements are displayed on the company s web site 
under the provisions of eitf  barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the advertising surrendered 
barter revenue recognized during   and was   and  respectively 
barter transactions are recognized at fair value as determined by the comparable advertising market rates at the time of placement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its advertisers and subscribers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of the company s advertisers and subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer equipment and five years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the respective lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
accordingly  the company performed a discounted cash flow analysis of all long lived assets and concluded that its investment in businessnet online  a joint venture with israeli newspaper publisher the ha aretz group ltd  had been fully impaired 
the impairment charge of approximately million has been included in the december  consolidated statement of operations 
see note 
income taxes the company was organized on june  as a limited liability company llc for federal and state income tax purposes 
accordingly  the company was treated as a partnership and the net losses of the company were included in the individual tax returns of the members 
on may   the company converted from an llc to a c corporation 
at the time of the conversion  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that the tax change occurs 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments  accounts and other receivables  and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instruments 
legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of the company s consolidated financial statements  as of december   the company has accrued its estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in each matter and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although the company intends to defend these actions vigorously  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  the company cannot accurately predict the outcome of the litigation  or their effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions  or the effectiveness of its strategies  related to these proceedings 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and net revenues advertising e commerce revenues 
advertising and e commerce revenues decreased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a significant slowdown in the overall online advertising market resulting in reduced sales of internet sponsorship  banner and e mail advertisements  which contributed to a reduction in our revenue per  page views

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company believes that its market risk exposures are immaterial as the company does not have instruments for trading purposes  and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings  material changes in fair values or cash flows for all instruments 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are all the material risks facing thestreet 
com 
the company may also face some non material risks which the company has not discussed in the following description of its risk factors 
if any of the following risks occur  the company s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has a history of losses  and although the company has diversified its sources of revenue  potential fluctuations in the company s quarterly financial results make financial forecasting difficult as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company has not achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur net losses in the company expects to continue to incur significant operating expenses and  as a result  will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability  which may not occur 
even if the company does achieve profitability  the company may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company has developed a loyal audience of individual investors at various experience levels who turn to our product offerings for all their financial and investing information needs 
we have a growing audience of professional investors who use our products to help them make better investing and trading decisions for their clients 
in addition  we have important strategic relationships with leading companies in the media  technology and financial services sectors that also help us create brand awareness and increase subscription and advertising revenues 
the company s goal is to monetize and leverage its financial content across a variety of platforms 
however  the company cannot assure you that its initiatives will result in increases in revenues sufficient to enable the company to achieve profitability 
in such an event  the price of the company s common stock is likely to decrease 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
similar seasonal patterns are developing in the company s industry 
the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its operating results may not be a good indication of its future performance  nor would its operating results for any particular quarter be indicative of future operating results 
in some future quarters the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such an event  the price of the company s common stock is likely to decrease 
the company may have difficulty selling its advertising inventory  a significant portion of which is concentrated among the company s top advertisers the market for online advertising sales has not recovered from its severe decline 
both traditional and new media advertisers continue to scale back their online media budgets 
in addition  seasonal fluctuations in the markets for consumer products cause advertisers to generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
as a result  many advertising supported web sites continue to experience difficulty selling their available inventories and maintaining their rate structures 
although the company believes that its network of sites and corresponding demographic profiles will continue to enable it to maintain its high sell through  the company expects that its overall advertising rates will decrease as a result of increased inventory and the continued decline in the online advertising market 
additionally  the company has reduced the cost of several of its headline indexing and content distribution agreements with certain internet portals and content providers to distribute its news and headlines to their users  thus driving potential readers to the company s web sites at lower cost 
the company believes that these arrangements will continue to provide a cost effective way to increase its unique visitors and page view inventory 
however  the company s actual traffic is subject to a variety of factors  including seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage that generally cause weakness in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  technical difficulties associated with the implementation and ongoing delivery of the news distribution arrangements  and editorial policy changes by the company s partners 
if the company is unable to attract significantly increased traffic  or if despite increased traffic  advertising revenues continue to decrease due to continued softness in the online advertising market  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s top five advertisers accounted for approximately of its total advertising revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   our top five advertisers accounted for approximately of our total advertising and e commerce revenues  as compared to approximately for the twelve months ended december  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of a number of its top advertisers  and such a loss could be concentrated in a single quarter 
further  if the company does not continue to increase its revenue from financial services advertisers or attract advertisers from non financial industries  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as is typical in the advertising industry  the company s advertising contracts have cancellation provisions 
the company may have difficulty adding subscribers and retaining current subscribers the company continues to seek to retain its current subscribers and to attract new subscribers 
as of december   the company had approximately  paid subscribers to seven subscription products  including both retail and corporate  up from approximately  at the end of the third quarter of but down from approximately  subscribers to thestreet 
com  then the company s only subscription product  prior to the doubling of the subscription price in connection with thestreet 
com s relaunch as the subscription only realmoney 
com site  and the conversion of thestreet 
com into a free  advertising supported site 
the company believes it has significantly enhanced its subscription offerings to differentiate them from the free financial and investing information that is widely available on the web  including on the company s own flagship site 
however  given the availability of such free financial information  the company may not be able to retain its current subscribers and attract additional subscribers in a cost effective manner 
if the company s subscription base declines more than anticipated or the cost of subscriber acquisition increases  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties in developing new and enhanced products and services could harm the company s business the company has introduced additional and enhanced products and services in in order to retain its current subscribers and attract new subscribers  and intends to introduce still more in if the company introduces a product or service that is not favorably received  its current readers may choose a competitive service over the company s 
the company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent it from introducing new products and services  or the new products or services the company introduces could contain errors that are discovered after they are introduced 
in some cases  the company is dependent on third parties  including software companies  application service providers and technology consulting firms  to help the company develop and implement new products and services 
if these third parties are not able to fulfill their responsibilities to the company on schedule or if the technology developed by them for the company s use does not function as anticipated  implementation may be delayed and the cost of implementation may be higher than anticipated 
such developments could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
unforeseen development difficulties may hinder the company s efforts the company has significantly enhanced its design and its technological infrastructure to further improve its sites and to accommodate increased traffic  and intends to continue such development activities 
however  unforeseen development difficulties could prevent the company from implementing such improvements or cause the costs to implement such improvements  including design  technology and related costs  to be higher than anticipated 
in the past  the company has experienced significant spikes in traffic on its web sites when there have been important financial news events 
accordingly  the company s web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic  often at unexpected times 
although the company has upgraded and continues to improve its systems  the company s web sites have in the past  and may in the future  experience publishing problems  slower response times than usual or other problems for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to perceive its web sites as not functioning properly and  therefore  cause them to use other methods to obtain their financial news and information 
in such a case  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company faces a risk of system failure that may result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to its reputation the company s ability to provide timely information and continuous news updates depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems 
similarly  the company s ability to track  measure and report the delivery of advertisements on its site depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
in june  the company s internet hosting agreement with exodus communications  inc was renewed  and the company currently continues to maintain a portion of its production servers at exodus s new jersey data center  with the remainder at the company s principal offices in new york city 
in september  exodus filed for bankruptcy 
in february  the assets of exodus were acquired by cable wireless plc  a global telecommunications company headquartered in great britain  which assumed the company s hosting contract 
the company s operations depend on the ability of cable wireless to protect its own systems and the company s systems in its data center against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failure  vandalism and similar unexpected adverse events 
although cable wireless provides comprehensive facilities management services  including human and technical monitoring of all production servers hours per day  seven days per week  cable wireless does not guarantee that the company s internet access will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
any disruption in the internet access to the company s web sites provided by cable wireless could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s own internal systems and operations  as well as those of cable wireless  may be subject to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  fire  water damage  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in the company s service or a decrease in responsiveness of its web sites could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation  brand and the company s relations with its advertisers and e commerce partners 
like most web sites  the company may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and other deliberate attempts to disrupt its technological operations  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
in addition  unauthorized persons may improperly access the company s data 
the company s insurance policies may not adequately compensate the company for any losses that the company may incur because of any failures in its system or interruptions in its delivery of content 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any event  damage or failure that interrupts or delays the company s operations 
the company s future success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel the company s future success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key personnel  including executives  editors  writers  and technology personnel 
certain of the company s key employees are bound by employment or non competition agreements 
the loss of one or more of the company s key personnel  or the company s inability to attract replacements with appropriate expertise  could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition could reduce the company s market share and harm its financial performance a number of financial news and information sources compete for consumers and advertisers attention and spending 
the company competes for advertisers  readers  staff and outside contributors with many types of companies  including online services or web sites focused on business  finance and investing  such as cbs 
marketwatch 
com  cnbc on msn money  cnnfn 
com  the wall street journal interactive edition  the new york times on the web  dowjones 
com  smartmoney 
com  and the motley fool  publishers and distributors of traditional media  including print  radio and television  such as the wall street journal  fortune  bloomberg business radio and cnbc  providers of terminal based financial news and data  such as bloomberg business news  reuters news service and dow jones markets  web portal companies  such as yahoo and america online  and online brokerage firms  many of which provide financial and investment news and information  such as charles schwab  e trade and merrill lynch 
the company s ability to compete depends on many factors  including the originality  timeliness  insightfulness and trustworthiness of its content and that of the company s competitors  the ease of use of services developed either by the company or its competitors and the effectiveness of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company does 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than the company can to the development and promotion of their services 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies including offering more of their financial news and commentary for free and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees  outside contributors  strategic partners and advertisers 
the company s competitors may develop content that is equal or superior to the company s or that achieves greater market acceptance than the company s 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
the company may not be able to compete successfully for advertisers  readers  staff or outside contributors  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also competes with other web sites  television  radio and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the internet or the company s web sites to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or to advertising on the company s web sites 
a failure to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other companies could decrease the company s subscriber and reader base  which may harm the company s business the company depends on establishing and maintaining content syndication and headline indexing relationships with high traffic web sites for a significant portion of its current subscriber and reader base 
there is intense competition for relationships with these firms and placement on these sites  and the company may have to pay significant fees to establish additional content syndication and headline indexing relationships or maintain existing relationships in the future 
the company may be unable to enter into or successfully renew relationships with these firms or sites on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
these relationships may not attract significant numbers of subscribers or readers 
many companies that the company may approach for a strategic relationship or who already have strategic relationships with the company also provide financial news and information from other sources 
as a result  these companies may be reluctant to enter into or maintain strategic relationships with the company 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the company does not establish additional  and maintain existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if any of the company s strategic relationships do not result in an increase in the number of subscribers or readers of its web sites 
the company may be unable to grow through acquisitions and integrate future acquisitions into its business the company intends to pursue a growth strategy that may involve acquisitions of other companies 
however  the company may be unable to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  the pursuit and integration of acquisitions will require substantial attention from the company s senior management  which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to the company s existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into its business or implement its plans without delay or substantial cost 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate growth may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
any failure of the company s internal security measures or breach of its privacy protections could cause the company to lose users and subject it to liability users who subscribe to one of the company s subscription based products are required to furnish certain personal information including name  mailing address  phone number  email address and credit card information  which the company uses to administer its services 
additionally  the company recently implemented a registration system that will collect certain information although not payment information from users of its free flagship site who wish to gain access to certain features of the company s site 
if the security measures that the company uses to protect personal information are ineffective  the company may lose users and the company s business may be harmed 
additionally  the company relies on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real time credit card authorization and verification 
the company cannot predict whether technological developments or human error could allow these security measures to be circumvented 
the company may need to use significant resources to prevent security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any security breaches 
if the company is not able to prevent all security breaches  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s users depend on the company to keep their personal information private and to not disclose it to third parties 
the company therefore maintains a privacy policy  under which  with certain limited exceptions  it will not disclose to any third parties any personal information about its subscribers or other users 
the company has retained the ability to modify the privacy policy at any time 
if the company s users perceive that the company is not protecting their privacy  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties associated with the company s brand development may harm its ability to attract subscribers and readers the company believes that maintaining and growing awareness about the thestreet 
com and realmoney brands is an important aspect of its efforts to continue to attract users 
the company s new products do not have widely recognized brands  and the company will need to increase awareness of these brands among potential users 
although the company s efforts to build brand awareness have been successful to date  they may not be cost effective or successful in the future in reaching potential users  and some potential users may not be receptive to the company s advertising campaign or other efforts 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of thestreet 
com brand or in persuading potential users to subscribe to the company s products or visit the company s sites 
failure to maintain the company s reputation for trustworthiness may reduce the number of its readers  which may harm its business it is very important that the company maintains its reputation as a trustworthy news organization 
the occurrence of events  including the company s misreporting a news story or the non disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of the company s writers in breach of its compliance policy  could harm the company s reputation for trustworthiness 
these events could result in a significant reduction in the number of the company s readers  which could materially adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability for information displayed on the company s web sites may require it to defend against legal claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures the company may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information the company publishes on its web sites or in other media 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
the company could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from its web sites through links to other web sites 
the company has stock ticker based message boards that allow users to post comments about individual stocks 
the company undertakes no obligation to moderate these message boards  and potential liability for providers of message board services has not yet been well established 
the company may choose to allow its editorial staffers or outside contributors to post on its boards  thus increasing the company s potential liability 
the company s insurance may not adequately protect it against these claims 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property rights could harm its brand building efforts and ability to compete effectively to protect the company s rights to its intellectual property  the company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its employees  affiliates  customers  strategic partners and others 
the protective steps the company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  its intellectual property rights 
the company has registered its trademarks in the united states and also has pending us and foreign applications for other trademarks 
effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company offers or intends to offer its services 
failure to adequately protect the company s intellectual property could harm its brand  devalue its proprietary content and affect its ability to compete effectively 
further  defending the company s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have to defend against intellectual property infringement claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures although the company believes that its proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against the company or claims that the company has violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
the company incorporates licensed third party technology in some of its services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have generally agreed to defend  indemnify and hold the company harmless with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right 
the company cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect it from infringement claims 
any infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on the company s part  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s ability to maintain and increase its readership depends on the continued growth in use and efficient operation of the web the web based information market is new and rapidly evolving 
the company s business would be materially adversely affected if web usage does not continue to grow or grows slowly 
web usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as inadequate network infrastructure  security and privacy concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed access to the internet 
the company s readers depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to its web sites 
many of these companies providing such services have filed for bankruptcy 
many have experienced significant service outages in the past and could experience service outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to the company s systems 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to perceive the web in general or the company s web sites in particular as an unreliable medium and  therefore  cause them to use other media to obtain their financial news and information 
the company also depends on a number of information providers to deliver information and data feeds to it on a timely basis 
the company s web sites could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a general decline in online advertising could harm the company s business the company s future success is dependent in part on the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
the internet advertising industry is still evolving  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand and market acceptance for internet advertising solutions is uncertain and in recent months its growth has slowed significantly 
many of the company s current or potential advertising customers have little or no experience using the internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
these customers may find internet advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional advertising media 
in addition  most of the company s current and potential web publisher customers have little experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space on their web sites 
the company cannot assure you that current or potential advertising customers will continue to allocate a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or that the demand for internet advertising will continue to develop to sufficiently support internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
if the demand for internet advertising develops more slowly than the company expects  then its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
no standards have been widely accepted to measure the effectiveness of web advertising 
if standards do not develop  existing advertisers may not continue or increase their levels of web advertising 
if standards develop and the company is unable to meet these standards  advertisers may not continue advertising on the company s site 
furthermore  advertisers that have traditionally relied upon other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the web 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the market for web advertising declines or develops more slowly than expected 
different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the web 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project the company s future advertising rates and revenues 
the company cannot assure you that it will be successful under alternative pricing models that may emerge 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a web user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could materially adversely affect the commercial viability of web advertising  which could materially adversely affect the company s advertising revenues 
in addition  some internet commentators  privacy advocates and federal and state officials have recently suggested that legislation may be needed to better safeguard online privacy  by the limitation or elimination of the use of cookies or by other methods 
if such legislation is passed  it is likely to restrict the ability of online advertisers to target their ads  which may result in a decrease in online advertising rates or online advertising spending generally 
such a decrease could materially adversely affect the company s advertising revenues 
the company also derives advertising revenues from email services  which exposes it to potential liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  privacy violations or interruptions or delays in email service 
any allegation of impropriety or any successful claim could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company competes with other web sites  television  radio and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the web in general or the company s web sites in particular to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to online advertising or to advertising on the company s web sites 
government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to the web could increase the company s costs of transmitting data and increase its legal and regulatory expenditures and could decrease its readership existing domestic and international laws or regulations and private industry guidelines specifically regulate communications or commerce on the web 
further  laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation of e commerce transactions and the characteristics and quality of online products and services are under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies and by private industry groups 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online services providers in a manner similar to the regulation of long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on such companies 
the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to the company s activities 
these regulations  if imposed  could increase the cost of transmitting data over the web 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
the interpretation and application of existing securities laws to web based financial news providers  including laws governing investment advisors  investment companies and broker dealers  by the securities and exchange commission and state securities regulators  is a developing area 
if  as this area matures  the company s activity is interpreted as subjecting it to regulation  the company could be subject to liability  and its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company is also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws which limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit and financial information  including the gramm leach bliley act 
although the company s compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on it  governments  trade associations and industry self regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws  regulations and guidelines  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  for us and the company s customers 
the us federal and various state governments have been investigating certain internet companies regarding their use of personal information and have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain information from users in europe 
the company could incur additional expenses if any new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these agencies chose to investigate the company s privacy practices 
also  as a consequence of governmental legislation or regulation or enforcement efforts or evolving standards of fair information collection practices  the company may be required to make changes to its products or services in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of the product or service or its attractiveness to potential customers  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
any new laws or regulations relating to the web  or certain application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the growth in the use of the web  decrease the demand for the company s web sites or otherwise materially adversely affect its business 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the us congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  libel  obscenity and personal privacy apply to the internet and internet advertising 
concerns about web security could reduce the company s advertising revenues  decrease its reader base and increase its web security expenditures concern about the transmission of confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications over the web 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter more people from using the web or from using it to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  such as signing up for a paid subscription  executing stock trades or purchasing goods or services 
because many of the company s advertisers seek to advertise on its web sites to encourage people to use the web to purchase goods or services  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if internet users significantly reduce their use of the web because of security concerns 
the company may also incur significant costs to protect it against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
control by principal stockholders  officers and directors could adversely affect the company s stockholders the company s officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  acting together  have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to its stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets and to control its management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company  which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
volatility of the company s stock price could adversely affect the company s stockholders the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies  particularly internet related companies  have been highly volatile 
the trading price of the company s stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
from october through december   the closing sale price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from to 
as of march   the closing sale price was 
the company s stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in the company s markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  regardless of its operating performance 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even if doing so would be beneficial to the company s stockholders 
the company does not intend to pay dividends the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future
