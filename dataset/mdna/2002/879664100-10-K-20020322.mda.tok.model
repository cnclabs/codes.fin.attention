the company does not anticipate having to recognize any material losses on these contracts during financial instruments the company conducts business on a global basis in several major currencies and is subject to the risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
in response to this  the company developed a foreign currency exposure management policy with the objective of mitigating financial exposure to changing foreign exchange rates resulting from nonfunctional currency receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
the company utilizes derivatives  primarily foreign currency forward contracts  to manage its foreign currency exposure 
the company does not engage in hedging specific individual transactions  but rather uses derivatives to manage overall exposure levels for a specific currency 
gains and losses related to these derivatives are recorded to the consolidated statement of operations each month 
the company s policy is to hedge of the calculated exposure 
foreign currency forward contracts are executed weekly with the final contracts for each period executed one week before the end of the period 
as a result of this timing additional nonfunctional foreign currency transactions can occur during the last week of the period that could cause the company s hedge percentage at the end of the period to be greater or less than the target

changes in the fair value of these instruments are included in earnings  as part of other income expense  in the current period 
net losses on forward exchange contracts were   and  for  and  respectively 
the company s current hedging practices do not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment as prescribed in sfas no 
since hedges of existing assets or liabilities that will be remeasured with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings are specifically excluded 
derivative financial instruments involve elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the financial statements 
the market risk that results from these instruments relates to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates  which is expected to be partially offset by movements in the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of the company s derivative transactions 
the company does not believe there is a significant credit risk because the counterparties are all large international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
in addition  the company also limits the amount of agreements entered into with any one financial institution in order to mitigate credit risk
