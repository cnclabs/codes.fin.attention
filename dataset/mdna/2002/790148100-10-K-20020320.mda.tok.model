item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  estimates and intentions  as well as trends and uncertainties that could affect our results 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for additional information concerning these factors and related matters see risk factors in item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances  additionally we evaluate these results on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that a real estate project is economically viable 
the company capitalizes external and internal costs  directly associated with the development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs  such as internal costs of a project field office  that clearly relate to a specific project under development are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest  up to an amount not to exceed total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects while under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any costs previously capitalized are expensed 
residential real estate inventory and cost of sales 
real estate inventories include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers  and amenities 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
estimates of costs to complete for sold homes are recorded at the time of closing 
estimates of sales values or costs to complete may differ from actual results 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized on the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
real estate investments  other long lived assets  and goodwill are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable  the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that the asset is impaired  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if management s estimate of the future cash flows differs from actual cash flows  the asset s recorded amount could be different than its fair value 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  fas also specifies criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a purchase 
table of contents method business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fas as a result of fas  the company will cease amortizing million of goodwill  the company had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization in in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of all goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company expects to complete the initial reviews during the first quarter of management does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that an impairment charge will not be recorded 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
fas addresses issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or value less cost to sell 
additionally  fas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the company is required to adopt statement no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of statement will have on the company s financial statements
