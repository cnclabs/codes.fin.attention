item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other detailed information appearing in this document 
general we are a diversified financial services organization operating predominantly in the eastern and central portions of the united states 
we originate  sell and service business purpose loans and home equity loans  through our principal direct and indirect subsidiaries 
we also process and purchase home equity loans through the bank alliance program 
through this program we purchase home equity loans from other financial institutions which may have different underwriting guidelines than ours 
following our purchase of the loans through this program  we hold these loans as available for sale until they are sold in connection with a future securitization or on a whole loan basis 
our loans primarily consist of fixed interest rate loans secured by first or second mortgages on single family residences 
our customers are primarily credit impaired borrowers who are generally unable to obtain financing from banks or savings and loan associations and who are attracted to our products and services 
we originate loans through a combination of channels including a national processing center located at our centralized operating office in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania  a regional processing center in roseland  new jersey and a network of retail branch offices 
in addition  we offer subordinated debt securities to the public  the proceeds of which are used for repayment of existing debt  loan originations  our operations  investments in systems and technology and for general corporate purposes including  but not limited to  repurchases of our outstanding common stock 
initially  we finance our loans under several secured and committed credit facilities 
these credit facilities are generally revolving lines of credit  which we have with several financial institutions that enable us to borrow on a short term basis against our loans 
we then securitize or sell our loans to unrelated third parties on a whole loan basis to generate the cash to pay off these revolving credit facilities 
we also have a committed mortgage conduit facility with a financial institution that enables us to sell our loans into an off balance sheet facility 
additionally  we rely upon funds generated by the sale of subordinated debt and other borrowings to fund our operations and to repay our debt as it matures 
at june   million of subordinated debt was outstanding and revolving credit and conduit facilities totaling million were available  of which million was drawn upon on that date 
we expect to continue to rely on the borrowings to fund our operations and to repay maturing subordinated debt 
for a description of our credit facilities  subordinated debt and off balance sheet facilities  see liquidity and capital resources 
in our mortgage loan securitizations  pools of mortgage loans are sold to a trust 
the trust then issues certificates or notes  which we refer to as certificates in this document  to third party investors  representing the right to receive a pass through interest rate and principal collected on the mortgage loans each month 
the difference between the average interest rate that is charged to borrowers on the fixed interest rate pools of mortgage loans and the weighted average pass through interest rate paid to investors are referred to as the interest rate spread 
our business strategy is dependent on our ability to emphasize lending related activities that provide us with the most economic value 
the implementation of this strategy will depend in large part on a variety of factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms and to profitably securitize our loans on a regular basis 
our failure with respect to any of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our strategy  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see risk factors if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our business strategy  our profitability may decrease  which could impair our ability to repay our subordinated debt 
during fiscal years and  declines in securitization pass through interest rates resulted in interest rate spreads improving by approximately basis points at june  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal increased interest rate spreads result in increases in the residual cash flow we will receive on securitized loans and corresponding increases in the gains we recognized on the sale of loans in a securitization 
see securitizations for further details 
no assurances can be made that market interest rates will continue to decline or remain at current levels 
however  in a rising interest rate environment we would expect our ability to originate loans at interest rates that will maintain our current level of profitability to become more difficult than during a stable or falling interest rate environment 
this situation occurred from our september mortgage loan securitization through the june mortgage loan securitization when the pass through interest rates on the asset backed securities issued in our securitizations had increased by approximately basis points 
during the same period  the average interest rate on our loans securitized increased only basis points 
we would address the challenge presented by a rising interest rate environment by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition  market trends and the use of hedging strategies in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
see interest rate risk management strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for a discussion of our hedging strategies 
a rising interest rate environment could unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
rising interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by widening investor interest rate spread requirements in pricing future securitizations as described above  increasing the levels of overcollateralization required in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity 
state and federal banking regulatory agencies  state attorneys general offices  the federal trade commission  the us department of justice  the us department of housing and urban development and state and local governmental authorities have increased their focus on lending practices by some companies in the subprime lending industry  more commonly referred to as predatory lending practices 
state  local and federal governmental agencies have imposed sanctions for practices including  but not limited to  charging borrowers excessive fees  imposing higher interest rates than the borrower s credit risk warrants and failing to adequately disclose the material terms of loans to the borrowers 
as a result of these initiatives  we are unable to predict whether state  local or federal authorities will require changes in our lending practices in the future  including the reimbursement of borrowers as a result of fees charged or the imposition of fines  or the impact of those changes on our profitability 
the pennsylvania attorney general reviewed certain fees charged to pennsylvania customers by our subsidiary  homeamerican credit  inc  which does business as upland mortgage 
although we believe that these fees were fair and in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  we agreed to reimburse borrowers approximately  with respect to a particular fee and to reimburse the commonwealth of pennsylvania  for its costs of investigation and for future public protection purposes 
we have satisfied the monetary commitments and obligations to the pennsylvania attorney general 
the reserve  which we previously established  was adequate to cover the resolution of this matter 
in addition to the regulatory initiatives with respect to so called predatory lending practices  we are also subject  from time to time  to private litigation  including actual and purported class action suits 
see business legal proceedings for a description of one purported class action suit currently pending 
we expect  that as a result of the publicity surrounding predatory lending practices  we may be subject to other class action suits in the future 
although we are licensed to originate loans predominantly in the eastern and central portions of the united states  we currently originate loans primarily in the eastern half of the united states 
the concentration of loans in a specific geographic region subjects us to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in the eastern half of the country would more greatly affect us than if our lending business were more geographically diversified 
as a result  an economic downturn or recession in this region could result in reduced profitability 
see risk factors an economic downturn or recession in the eastern half of the united states could result in reduced profitability  which would reduce the funds we have available to repay our subordinated debt 
in january  our subsidiary  new jersey mortgage and investment corp  was renamed american business mortgage services  inc to better reflect its national presence 
effective december   we de emphasized and subsequent to that date  discontinued the origination of business equipment leases but continue to service the remaining portfolio of leases 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
the application of these accounting policies requires significant judgment and assumptions by management  which are based upon historical experience and future expectations 
the nature of our business and our accounting methods make our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations highly dependent on management s estimates 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is highly dependent on the application of statement of financial accounting standards  referred to as sfas in this document  no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and gain on sale accounting to our quarterly loan securitizations 
gains on sales of loans through securitizations for the year ended june  were of total revenues 
securitization gains represent the difference between the net proceeds to us  including retained interests in the securitization  and the allocated cost of loans securitized 
the allocated cost of loans securitized is determined by allocating their net carrying value between the loans  the interest only strips and the servicing rights we retain based upon their relative fair values 
estimates of the fair values of the interest only strips and the servicing rights we retain are discussed below 
we believe the accounting estimates related to gain on sale are critical accounting estimates because more than of the securitization gains were based on estimates of retained interests in fiscal the amount recognized as gain on sale for the retained interests we receive as proceeds in a securitization  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  is highly dependent on management s estimates 
interest only strips 
interest only strips  which represent the right to receive future cash flows from securitized loans represent of our total assets at june  and are carried at their fair values 
fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the present value of the future expected residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows utilizing assumptions made by management at the time the loans are sold 
these assumptions include the rates used to calculate the present value of expected future residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows  referred to as the discount rates  and expected prepayment and credit loss rates on pools of loans sold through securitizations 
we believe the accounting estimates used in determining the fair value of interest only strips are critical accounting estimates because estimates of prepayment and credit loss rates are made based on management s expectation of future experience  which is based in part  on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and in the case of prepayment rate assumptions  consideration of the impact of changes in market interest rates 
the actual loan prepayment rate may be affected by a variety of economic and other factors  including prevailing interest rates  the availability of alternative financing to borrowers and the type of loan 
our expected future cash flows from our interest only strips are periodically re evaluated 
the current assumptions for prepayment and credit loss rates are monitored against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and are changed if deemed necessary 
even a small unfavorable change in our assumptions made as a result of unfavorable actual experience or other considerations could have a significant adverse impact on our estimate of residual cash flows and on the value of these assets 
in the event of an unfavorable change in these assumptions  the fair value of these assets would be overstated  requiring an accounting adjustment  which would adversely affect our income in the period of adjustment 
see securitizations for more detail on the estimation of  and changes made to the assumptions used in the estimation of  the fair value of interest only strips and the sensitivities of these balances to changes in assumptions and the impact on our financial statements of changes in assumptions 
interest accretion income represents the yield component of cash flows received on interest only strips 
we use a prospective approach to estimate interest accretion 
as previously discussed  we periodically update estimates of residual cash flow from our securitizations 
under the prospective approach  when it is probable that there is a favorable or unfavorable change in estimated residual cash flow from the cash flow previously projected  we recognize a larger or smaller percentage of the cash flow as interest accretion 
any change in value of the underlying interest only strip could impact our current estimate of residual cash flow earned from the securitizations 
for example  a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and related projected cash flows 
servicing rights 
servicing rights  which represent the rights to receive contractual servicing fees from securitization trusts and ancillary fees from borrowers net of estimated compensation that would be required by a substitute servicer represented of our total assets at june  servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the benefits of servicing in excess of adequate compensation  which would be required by a substitute servicer 
the benefits of servicing are the present value of projected net cash flows from contractual servicing fees and ancillary servicing fees 
we believe the accounting estimates used in determining the fair value of servicing rights are critical accounting estimates because the projected cash flows from servicing fees incorporate assumptions made by management  including prepayment rates  credit loss rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the interest only strips retained in a securitization 
the current assumptions for prepayment and credit loss rates are monitored against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and are changed if deemed necessary 
even a small unfavorable change in our assumptions  made as a result of unfavorable actual experience or other considerations could have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets 
in the event of an unfavorable change in these assumptions  the fair value of these assets would be overstated  requiring an adjustment  which would adversely affect our income in the period of adjustment 
see securitizations for more detail on the estimation of  and changes made to the assumptions used in the estimation of  the fair value of servicing rights and the sensitivities of these balances to changes in assumptions and the impact on our financial statements of changes in assumptions 
amortization of the servicing rights asset for securitized loans is calculated individually for each securitized loan pool and is recognized in proportion to  and over the period of estimated future servicing income on that particular pool of loans 
if our analysis indicates the carrying value of servicing rights is not recoverable through future cash flows from contractual servicing and other ancillary fees  a valuation allowance would be required 
as of june   our valuation analysis has not indicated any impairment 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
special purpose entities and off balance sheet facilities 
special purpose entities and off balance sheet facilities are used in our mortgage loan securitizations 
asset securitizations are one of the most common off balance sheet arrangements in which a company transfers assets off its balance sheet by selling them to a special purpose entity 
the special purpose entities described below meet our objectives for mortgage loan securitization structures and comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accounting for special purpose entities is under review by the financial accounting standards board  referred to as fasb in this document 
in june  the fasb issued a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements 
the proposal provides guidance on consolidation by a business enterprise of special purpose entities 
the proposal  if adopted as proposed  will not affect our current consolidation policies for special purpose entities or recognition of gains for the sale of loans 
in the event that the proposal is not adopted as proposed or accounting rules are changed in the future  our use of special purpose entities  our revenue recognition for securitization gains for securitized loans and our off balance sheet accounting treatment for securitized loans could be materially impacted 
our securitizations involve a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
first  we sell the loans to a special purpose entity  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the loans and establishing a true sale under legal standards 
next  the special purpose entity sells the loans to a qualified special purpose entity  which we refer to as the trust  transferring title of the loans and isolating those assets from our assets 
finally  the trust issues certificates to investors to raise the cash purchase price for the loans being sold  collects proceeds on behalf of the certificate holders  distributes proceeds and is a distinct legal entity  independent from us 
under current accounting rules  the trusts do not qualify for consolidation in our financial statements and carry the loan collateral as assets and the certificates issued to investors as liabilities 
at june  and  the mortgage securitization trusts held loans with an aggregate principal balance due of billion and billion as assets and owed billion and billion of investor certificates to third parties  respectively 
we also use special purpose entities in our sales of loans to a million off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility 
sales into the off balance sheet facility involve a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
 similar to the process described above 
this facility has a revolving feature and can be directed by the sponsor to dispose of the loans 
typically this has been accomplished by securitizing them in a term securitization 
the third party note purchaser also has the right to sell the loans 
under this arrangement  the loans have been isolated from us and our subsidiaries and as a result  transfers to the facility are treated as sales for financial reporting purposes 
when loans are sold to this facility  we perform a probability assessment of the likelihood that the sponsor will transfer the loans into a term securitization 
as the sponsor has typically transferred the loans to a term securitization in the past  the amount of gain on sale we have recognized for loans sold to this facility is estimated based on the terms we would obtain in a term securitization rather than the terms of this facility 
at june   the off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility held loans with principal balance due of million as assets and owed million to third parties 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained primarily to account for loans and leases that are delinquent and are expected to be ineligible for sale into a future securitization and for delinquent loans that have been repurchased from securitization trusts 
the allowance is calculated based upon management s estimate of our ability to collect on outstanding loans and leases based upon a variety of factors  including  periodic analysis of the available for sale loans and leases  economic conditions and trends  historical credit loss experience  borrowers ability to repay  and collateral considerations 
additions to the allowance arise from the provision for credit losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan and lease charge offs reduce the allowance 
if the actual collection of outstanding loans and leases is less than we anticipate  further write downs would be required which would reduce our net income in the period the write down was required 
development of critical accounting estimates 
on a periodic basis  senior management reviews the estimates used in our critical accounting policies 
as a group  senior management discusses the development and selection of the assumptions used to perform our estimates described above 
management has discussed the development and selection of the estimates used in our critical accounting policies as of june  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  management has reviewed our disclosure of the estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee 
initial adoption of accounting policies 
generally  we do not enter into derivative financial instrument contracts for trading purposes 
however  in fiscal we have entered into a derivative financial instrument contract  which we have not designated as an accounting hedge and therefore is accounted for as a trading asset or liability 
this contract was designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in the one month london inter bank offered rate  referred to in this document as libor 
the structure of certain securitization trusts includes a floating interest rate tranche based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
floating interest rate tranches in a securitization expose us to gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest only strip from changes in the floating interest rate paid to the certificate holders 
in order to manage this exposure we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed interest rate on our third quarter fiscal securitization s variable rate tranche 
the swap agreement requires a net cash settlement on a monthly basis of the difference between the fixed interest rate on the swap and the libor paid on the certificates 
the fair value of this swap agreement is based on estimated market values for the sale of the contract provided by a third party 
as of june  the unrealized change in the fair value of this derivative financial instrument was a decrease of million and an additional million in net cash settlements were paid on the contract 
our interest only strips are held as available for sale securities and therefore changes in the fair value of the interest only strips are recorded as a component of equity unless the fair value of the interest only strip falls below its cost basis  which would require a write down through current period income 
see interest rate risk management for further details of this interest rate swap agreement 
impact of changes in critical accounting estimates in prior fiscal years discount rates 
during fiscal  a write down of million was recorded on our interest only strips  of which million was due to a change in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
at june   we increased the discount rate applicable to the residual portion of our interest only strips from to 
no changes were made in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips 
the change in the discount rate was considered to be an other than temporary fair value adjustment and was recorded as expense in fiscal the factors that led to this other than temporary decline in fair value of our interest only strips included o sustained increase in market interest rates through the fourth quarter of fiscal  o increases in the all in cost of our mortgage loan trust investor certificates from september through june  o increases in the cost of funding our interest only strips  particularly the interest rate paid on subordinated debt  and o events and conditions in the mortgage lending industry and the actions by others in that industry 
prepayment rates 
during the nine month period ended october  the percentage of home equity loans that we originated containing prepayment fees increased from less than of loans originated to over  a percentage which has been maintained since that time 
due to this increase in the volume of loans originated with prepayment fees  we had reduced the initial annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and lengthened the initial assumptions used for the prepayment ramp period on home equity loans from to months beginning with the mortgage loan securitization through the mortgage loan securitization and to months beginning with the mortgage loan securitization 
our experience indicated that when a loan has a prepayment fee provision  fewer borrowers will prepay  and those prepaying will do so more slowly 
our actual cumulative prepayment experience through march  demonstrated that only of home equity loans having prepayment fees were actually prepaid by the borrowers  while of home equity loans without prepayment fees were prepaid 
this cumulative historical performance demonstrates that it was nearly twice as likely that a loan without a prepayment fee would be prepaid 
the effect of these changes in prepayment rate assumptions increased the gains on securitizations for fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we evaluated our accumulated experience with pools of loans that had a high percentage of loans with prepayment fees 
we had begun using a static pool analysis of prepayments  whereby we analyzed historical prepayments by period  to determine average prepayments expected by period 
for business purpose loans  we found that prepayments for the first year are generally lower than we had anticipated  peak at a higher rate than previously anticipated by month and decline by month home equity loan prepayments generally ramped faster in the first year than we had anticipated but leveled more slowly over months and to a lower final rate than we had been using previously 
we utilized this information to modify our loan prepayment rates and ramp periods to better reflect the amount and timing of expected prepayments 
the effect of these changes implemented in the third quarter of fiscal was a net reduction in the value of our interest only strips of million or less than and an insignificant net impact on securitization gains for fiscal the effect on the interest only strips of this change in assumptions was recorded through an adjustment to comprehensive income in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
credit loss rates 
in fiscal  the initial credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization were increased as a result of an increase in the percentage of second mortgage loans originated and our concerns regarding high levels of real estate values 
the average percentage of first mortgage loans securitized had declined approximately from the fiscal securitizations to the fiscal securitizations 
high real estate values also affected our loss assumptions because in the event of an economic downturn  the loan to value ratios of the loans could be understated 
both of these factors increased the potential that the underlying real estate collateral would not be sufficient to satisfy the loan if a foreclosure were required 
although our percentage of first mortgages has subsequently increased  we believe real estate values may limit our ability to maintain the credit loss experience realized in prior securitizations 
the effect of these changes in credit loss assumptions reduced the gains on securitizations in fiscal by approximately million 
for a description of the impacts of changes in critical accounting estimates in the year ended june   see securitizations 
securitizations during the year ended june   write downs of million were recorded on our interest only strips due to increases in prepayment experience 
the income statement impact for fiscal was a write down of million while the remaining million was written down through other comprehensive income in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and emerging issues task force guidance  referred to as eitf in this document  the following table details the pre tax write downs of the interest only strips by quarter in thousands income other total statement comprehensive quarter ended write down impact income impact december     march     june     total fiscal    although we increased the prepayment rate assumptions used to value our interest only strips in the second quarter of fiscal  prepayment rates throughout the mortgage industry continued to increase and our prepayment experience continued to exceed even our revised assumptions 
based on current economic conditions  published mortgage industry surveys and our own prepayment experience  we believe prepayments will continue to remain at higher than normal levels for the near term before returning to average historical levels 
as a result  we have increased our prepayment rate assumptions for home equity loans for the near term  but at a declining rate  before returning to our historical levels 
however  we cannot predict with certainty what our prepayment experience will be in the future 
any unfavorable difference between the assumptions used to value our interest only strips and our actual experience may have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets 
the following table summarizes the volume of loan securitizations and whole loan sales for the years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  securitizations business loans    home equity loans    equipment leases  total    gain on sale of loans and leases through securitization    securitization gains as a percentage of total revenue whole loan sales    premiums on whole loan sales    our quarterly revenues and net income may fluctuate in the future principally as a result of the timing  size and profitability of our securitizations 
the strategy of selling loans through securitizations requires building an inventory of loans over time  during which time we incur costs and expenses 
since a gain on sale is not recognized until a securitization is closed  which may not occur until a subsequent quarter  operating results for a given quarter can fluctuate significantly 
if securitizations do not close when expected  we could experience a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the impact of securitizations on our cash flow 
several factors affect our ability to complete securitizations on a profitable basis 
these factors include conditions in the securities markets  such as fluctuations in interest rates described below  conditions in the asset backed securities markets relating to the loans we originate and credit quality of the managed portfolio of loans 
any substantial reduction in the size or availability of the securitization market for loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
when we securitize our loans by selling them to trusts  we receive cash and an interest only strip  which represents our retained interest in securitized loans 
the trust issues multi class securities  which derive their cash flows from the pool of securitized loans 
these securities  which are senior in right to our interest only strips in the trusts  are sold to public or private investors 
in addition  when we securitize our loans we retain the right to service the loans for a fee  which creates an asset that we refer to as our servicing rights 
servicing includes processing of mortgage payments  processing of disbursements for tax and insurance payments  maintenance of mortgage loan records  performance of collection efforts  including disposition of delinquent loans  foreclosure activities and disposition of real estate owned  referred to as reo  and performance of investor accounting and reporting processes 
interest only strips 
as the holder of the interest only strips  we are entitled to receive excess or residual cash flows and cash flows from overcollateralization 
these cash flows are the difference between the payments made by the borrowers on securitized loans and the sum of the scheduled and prepaid principal and pass through interest paid to trust investors  servicing fees  trustee fees and  if applicable  surety fees 
surety fees are paid to an unrelated insurance entity to provide protection for the trust investors 
generally  all residual cash flows are initially retained by the trust to establish required overcollateralization levels in the trust 
overcollateralization is the excess of the aggregate principal balances of loans in a securitized pool over the investor interests 
overcollateralization requirements are established to provide credit enhancement for the trust investors 
the overcollateralization requirements for a mortgage loan securitization  which are different for each securitization  include the initial requirement  if any  is a percentage of the original balance of loans securitized and is paid in cash at the time of sale  the final target is a percentage of the original balance of loans securitized and is funded from the monthly excess cash flow  and the stepdown overcollateralization requirement is a percentage of the remaining balance of securitized loans 
during the stepdown period  the overcollateralization amount is gradually reduced through cash payments to us until the overcollateralization balance declines to a specific floor 
the stepdown period generally begins at the later of to months or when the remaining balance of securitized loans are less than of the original balance of securitized loans 
the fair value of our interest only strips is a combination of the fair values of our residual cash flows and our overcollateralization cash flows 
at june   investments in interest only strips totaled million  including the fair value of overcollateralization related cash flows of million

the estimation of the fair value of interest only strips is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the present value of the future expected residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows utilizing assumptions made by management at the time loans are sold 
these assumptions include the rates used to calculate the present value of expected future residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows  referred to as the discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss rates on the pool of loans 
these assumptions are monitored against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and are changed if deemed necessary 
our methodology for determining the discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss rates used to calculate the fair value of our interest only strips is described below 
discount rates 
we use discount rates  which we believe are commensurate with the risks involved in our securitization assets 
while quoted market prices on comparable interest only strips are not available  we have performed conparisons of our valuation assumptions and performance experience to others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
we quantify the risks in our securitization assets by comparing the asset quality and performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage pools to comparable industry performance 
in determining the discount rate applied to residual cash flows  we believe that the practice of many companies in the non conforming mortgage industry has been to add an interest rate spread for risk to the all in cost of securitizations to determine their discount rates 
the all in cost of the trusts investor certificates includes the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate in each mortgage securitization  trustee fees  and surety fees  which generally range from to basis points combined 
from industry experience comparisons  we have determined an interest rate spread  which is added to the all in cost of our mortgage loan securitization trusts investor certificates 
the discount rate that we apply to our residual cash flow portion of our interest only strips compared to rates used by others in the industry reflects our higher asset quality and performance of our securitized assets compared to industry asset quality and performance and the other characteristics of our securitized loans described below o underlying loan collateral with fixed yields  which are higher than others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
average interest rate of securitized loans exceeds the industry average by basis points or more 
all of the securitized loans have fixed interest rates  which are more predictable than adjustable rate loans 
o approximately to of securitized business purpose loans have prepayment fees 
approximately to of securitized home equity loans have prepayment fees 
our historical experience indicates that prepayment fees lengthen the prepayment ramp periods and slow annual prepayment speeds  which have the effect of increasing the life of the securitized loans 
o a portfolio mix of first and second mortgage loans of and  respectively 
historically  the high proportion of first mortgages has resulted in lower delinquencies and losses 
o a portfolio credit grade mix comprised of a credits  b credits  c credits  and d credits 
in addition  our historical loss experience is below what is experienced by others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
although market interest rates have declined in fiscal years and  no reduction to the discount rate used to value the residual portion of our interest only strips has been made 
we do not believe a decrease in the discount rate is warranted as the current market interest rate decline was mainly due to actions taken by the federal reserve board in an attempt to prevent the potential adverse effect of uncertain economic conditions and to stimulate economic growth 
additionally  the non conforming mortgage lending industry generally has taken no actions to reduce discount rates 
we apply a second discount rate to projected cash flows from the overcollateralization portion of our interest only strips 
the discount rate applied to projected overcollateralization cash flows in each mortgage securitization is based on the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate in the mortgage securitization 
in fiscal  we instituted the use of a minimum discount rate of 
at june   the average discount rate applied to projected overcollateralization cash flows was 
the risk characteristics of the projected overcollateralization cash flows do not include prepayment risk and have minimal credit risk 
for example  if the entire collateral balance in a securitized pool of loans was prepaid by borrowers  we would fully recover the overcollateralization portion of the interest only strips 
in addition  historically  these overcollateralization balances have not been impacted by credit losses as the residual cash flow portion of our interest only strips has always been sufficient to absorb credit losses and stepdowns of overcollateralization have generally occurred as scheduled 
overcollateralization represents our investment in the excess collateral in a securitized pool of mortgage loans 
the blended discount rate used to value the interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  prepayment rates 
the assumptions we use to estimate future prepayment rates are periodically compared to actual prepayment experience of the individual securitization pool of mortgage loans and an average of the actual experience of other similar pools of mortgage loans at the same number of months after their inception 
it is our practice to use an average historical prepayment rate of similar pools for the expected constant prepayment rate assumption while a pool of mortgage loans is less than a year old even though actual experience may be different 
during this period  before a pool of mortgage loans reaches its expected constant prepayment rate  actual experience both quantitatively and qualitatively is generally not sufficient to conclude that final actual experience for an individual pool of mortgage loans would be materially different from the average 
for pools of mortgage loans greater than one year old  prepayment experience trends for an individual pool is considered to be more significant 
for these pools  adjustments to prepayment assumptions may be made to more closely conform the assumptions to actual experience if the variance from average experience is significant and is expected to continue 
current economic conditions  current interest rates and other factors are also considered in our analysis 
as was previously discussed  during the year ended june  our actual prepayment experience was generally higher  most significantly on home equity loans  than our historical averages for prepayments 
the mortgage industry in general has had this experience 
our recent increase in prepayment experience has been mainly due to loan refinancings 
we do not believe that the current growth in the rate of refinancings is indicative of a long term trend in the non conforming mortgage market 
we believe this recent activity was due to significant decreases in market interest rates which have occurred over a short period of time which have generated a larger than normal volume of refinancing activity during this period 
based on current economic conditions  published mortgage industry surveys and our own prepayment experience  we believe prepayments will continue to remain at higher than normal levels for the near term before returning to average historical levels 
in addition to the use of prepayment fees on our loans  we have implemented programs and strategies in an attempt to reduce loan prepayments in the future 
these programs and strategies may include providing information to a borrower regarding costs and benefits of refinancing  which at times may demonstrate a refinancing option is not in the best economic interest of the borrower 
other strategies include offering second mortgages to existing qualified borrowers or offering financial incentives to qualified borrowers to deter prepayment of their loan 
we cannot predict with certainty what our prepayment experience will be in the future and any unfavorable difference between the assumptions used to value our interest only strips and our actual experience may have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets 
credit loss rates 
credit loss rates are analyzed in a similar manner to prepayment rates 
credit loss assumptions are compared to actual loss experience averages for similar mortgage loan pools and for individual mortgage loan pools 
delinquency trends and economic conditions are also considered 
if our periodic analysis indicates that loss experience may be different from our assumptions  we would adjust our assumptions as necessary 
floating interest rate certificates 
some of the securitization trusts have issued floating interest rate certificates supported by fixed interest rate mortgages 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive may be affected by any changes in the interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates 
the interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates are based on one month libor 
the assumption used to estimate the fair value of the excess cash flows received from these securitization trusts is based on a forward yield curve 
sensitivity analysis 
the table below outlines the sensitivity of the current fair value of our interest only strips and servicing rights to and adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of those assets 
our base prepayment  loss and discount rates are described in the table summary of material mortgage loan securitization valuation assumptions and actual experience

the base one month libor assumption used in this sensitivity analysis was derived from a forward yield curve 
the sensitivity analysis in the table above is hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a or variation in management s assumptions generally cannot easily be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption 
changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions  which might magnify or counteract the impact of the intended change 
these sensitivities reflect the approximate amount of the fair values that our interest only strips and servicing rights would be reduced for the indicated adverse changes 
these reductions would result in a charge to expense in the income statement in the period incurred and a resulting reduction of stockholders equity  net of income taxes 
the effect on our liquidity of changes in the fair values of our interest only strips and servicing rights are discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
residual assets from lease securitizations represent an immaterial portion of total residual assets and are therefore aggregated with the sensitivities of residual assets from mortgage loans in the above analysis 
the following tables provide information regarding the initial and current assumptions applied in determining the fair values of mortgage loan related interest only strips and servicing rights for each securitization trust

na not applicable lease securitizations 
we have in the past securitized two pools of leases 
as of december   we de emphasized  and subsequent to that date discontinued  the lease origination business but continue to service the remaining leases in our managed portfolio 
the interest only strips and servicing rights we retain on these securitized pools represent less than of our securitization residual assets at june  servicing rights 
as the holder of servicing rights on securitized loans  we are entitled to receive annual contractual servicing fees of to basis points on the aggregate outstanding loan balance 
these fees are paid out of accumulated mortgage loan payments before payments of principal and interest are made to trust certificate holders 
in addition  ancillary fees such as prepayment fees  late charges  nonsufficient fund fees and other fees are retained directly by us  as servicer  as payments are collected from the borrowers 
we also retain the interest paid on funds held in the trust s collection account until these funds are distributed from the trust 
the fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the benefits of servicing in excess of adequate compensation  which would be required by a substitute servicer 
the benefits of servicing are the present value of projected net cash flows from contractual servicing fees and ancillary servicing fees 
these projections incorporate assumptions  including prepayment rates  credit loss rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the interest only strips retained in a securitization 
periodically  capitalized servicing rights are evaluated for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
the origination of a high percentage of loans with prepayment fees impacts our servicing rights and income in two ways 
prepayment fees reduce the likelihood of a borrower prepaying their loan 
this results in prolonging the length of time a loan is outstanding  which increases the contractual servicing fees to be collected over the life of the loan 
additionally  the terms of our servicing agreements with the securitization trusts allow us to retain prepayment fees collected from borrowers as part of our compensation for servicing loans 
in addition  although prepayments increased during the year ended june  compared to our historical averages  we have generally found that the non conforming mortgage market is less sensitive to prepayments due to changes in interest rates than the conforming mortgage market where borrowers have more favorable credit history for the following reasons 
first  there are relatively few lenders willing to supply credit to non conforming borrowers which limits those borrowers opportunities to refinance 
second  interest rates available to non conforming borrowers tend to adjust much slower than conforming mortgage interest rates which reduces the non conforming borrowers opportunity to capture economic value from refinancing 
as a result of the use of prepayment fees and the reduced sensitivity to interest rate changes in the non conforming mortgage market  the prepayment experience on our managed portfolio is more stable than the mortgage market in general 
this stability favorably impacts our ability to value the future cash flows from our servicing rights and interest only strips because it increases the predictability of future cash flows 
whole loan sales 
we also sell loans with servicing released referred to as whole loan sales 
gains on whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds from such sales and the net carrying value of the loans 
the net carrying value of a loan is equal to its principal balance plus its unamortized origination costs and fees 
gains from these sales are recorded as fee income

excluding this accounting change net income for fiscal is level from fiscal diluted net income per share increased to for the year ended june   on average common shares of  compared to on average common shares of  for fiscal the increase in net income per share for the period was due to the lower number of shares outstanding due to our repurchases of our common stock 
dividends of and per share were paid out for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the common dividend payout ratio based on diluted net income per share was for the year ended june  compared to for fiscal increases in the gain on sale recorded during the fiscal year were mainly due to securitizing a higher volume of loans and a decline in market interest rates  which provided us more favorable terms in the execution of our securitizations 
this increase was partially offset by a million valuation adjustment on our interest only strips due to higher than expected prepayment rates  also resulting from a decline in market interest rates 
additional expense increases were noted in employee related costs and in general and administrative expenses mainly due to increases in costs to service the larger managed portfolio and interest expenses due to the higher subordinated debt balance 
see below for further discussion of gain on sale  the valuation adjustment of our interest only strips and expenses 
in fiscal  the board of directors initiated a stock repurchase program in view of the price level of our common stock  which was at the time and has continued to  trade at below book value 
in addition  our consistent earnings growth over the past several years did not result in a corresponding increase in the market value of our common stock 
the repurchase program was extended in fiscal  and the fiscal extension authorized the purchase of up to of the then outstanding shares  which totaled approximately  shares on the date of the extension 
to date  we have repurchased  shares under the current program 
the current repurchase program terminates in november we currently have no plans to continue to repurchase additional shares or extend the repurchase program beyond this date 
the total number of shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program was  shares in fiscal   shares in fiscal   shares in fiscal  and  shares in fiscal the cumulative effect of the stock repurchase program was an increase in diluted net earnings per share of  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
on august   the board of directors declared a stock dividend payable september  to shareholders of record on september  in conjunction with the board s resolution  all outstanding stock options and related exercise prices were adjusted 
accordingly  all outstanding common shares  earnings per common share  average common share and stock option amounts presented have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this stock dividend 
amounts presented for fiscal and have been similarly adjusted for the effect of a stock dividend declared on october  which was paid on november  to shareholders of record on october  in april  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
the guidance  among other things  changed the accounting for stock options issued to non employee directors 
previously  accounting rules required that options issued to non employees including directors be expensed based on the fair value of the options at the time the options were granted 
the new interpretation allows options granted to directors to be accounted for consistently with those granted to employees if certain conditions are met  and therefore  no expense is recognized where the exercise price equals or exceeds the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
in accordance with the guidance  in fiscal  we recorded thousand as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which represented the cumulative amount of expense recognized  net of taxes  in prior years for stock options issued to non employee directors

in addition  american business mortgage services  inc is in the process of expanding its network of loan brokers to include a larger geographical area in order to reduce concentrations of loans in specific states 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
for fiscal  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal growth in total revenue was mainly the result of increases in gains on the securitization of mortgage loans and increases in interest accretion earned on our interest only strips 
gain on sale of loans 
for the year ended june   gains of million were recorded on the securitization of billion of loans 
this represents an increase of million  or  over gains of million recorded on securitizations of billion of loans for the year ended june  the increase in securitization gains for the year ended june  was due to both an increase in interest rate spreads earned in our securitizations and an increase in the volume of loans securitized 
the securitization gain as a percentage of loans securitized increased to for the year ended june  from on loans securitized for the year ended june  increases in interest rate spreads increase expected residual cash flows to us and result in increases in the gains we recognize on the sale of loans into securitizations 
see securitizations for further detail of how securitization gains are calculated 
the increase in interest rate spread for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted from decreases in pass through interest rates on investor certificates issued by securitization trusts 
for loans securitized during the year ended june   the average loan interest rate was  a decrease from on loans securitized during the year ended june  however  the average interest rate on trust certificates issued in mortgage loan securitizations during the year ended june  was  a decrease from during the year ended june  the resulting net improvement in interest rate spread was approximately basis points 
also contributing to the increase in the securitization gain percentages for the year ended june   was the increase in the amount of cash received at the closing of our securitizations 
the improvement in the interest rate spread this fiscal year enabled us to enter into securitization transactions structured to provide additional cash at the closing of the securitization through the sale of trust certificates to investors at a premium  or through the sale of notional bonds  sometimes referred to as interest only bonds 
during the year ended june  we received additional cash at the closing of our securitizations  due to these modified structures  of million compared to million in fiscal securitization gains and cash received at the closing of securitizations were reduced by hedging losses of million in fiscal  compared to losses of million in fiscal interest and fees 
for the year ended june   interest and fee income decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended june  interest and fee income consists primarily of interest income earned on available for sale loans  premiums earned on whole loan sales and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loans and leases 
during the year ended june   interest income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  this decrease was due to a lower weighted average interest rate on loans available for sale from the prior fiscal year and lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances due to general decreases in market interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of a modification of the terms of our securitizations beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  which allowed us to retain interest income we had accrued up until the point of the sale 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  all accrued interest income was retained by the securitization trust when collected 
premiums on whole loan sales decreased million  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the volume of whole loan sales decreased  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in the volume of whole loan sales for the year ended june  resulted from management s decision to securitize additional loans in the favorable securitization market experienced during the year 
other fees decreased million for the year ended june  from the prior year mainly due to the decrease in fees collected in connection with our leasing portfolio 
our leasing portfolio has decreased due to our decision in fiscal to discontinue the origination of new leases 
the ability to collect certain fees on loans we originate in the future may be impacted by proposed laws and regulations by various authorities 
see business regulation for more information regarding how our practices related to fees could be affected 
interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was earned in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  the increase reflects the growth in the balance of our interest only strips of million  or  to million at june  from million at june  in addition  cash flows from interest only strips for the year ended june  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal due to the larger size of our more recent securitizations and additional securitizations reaching final target overcollateralization levels and step down overcollateralization levels 
servicing income 
servicing income is comprised of contractual and ancillary fees collected on securitized loans less amortization of the servicing rights assets that are recorded at the time loans are securitized 
ancillary fees include prepayment fees  late fees and other servicing fee compensation 
for the year ended june   servicing income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  the following table summarizes the components of servicing income for the years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  contractual and ancillary fees    amortization of servicing rights    servicing rights write down net servicing income    although higher than expected prepayment experience on home equity loans in fiscal has adversely effected the carrying value of our interest only strips  no write down has been required for servicing rights 
because the collection of prepayment fees increased in fiscal  due to increased prepayment rates  the amortization of servicing rights has also increased 
the level of amortization is recognized in proportion to servicing income 
therefore  although the estimated fair value of the remaining servicing rights are lower than we had originally anticipated  the carrying value of servicing rights on our balance sheet is also lower as a result of increased levels of amortization in fiscal a write down for servicing rights may be required in the future if we continue to experience higher than anticipated prepayment rates 
total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  as described in more detail below  this increase was mainly a result of a million interest only strips valuation adjustment recorded during the year ended june   increased interest expense attributable to the issuance of additional subordinated debt  increases in employee related costs and increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
during fiscal interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the level of subordinated debt outstanding 
average subordinated debt outstanding during the year ended june  was million compared to million during the year ended june  the effect of the increase in outstanding debt was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rates paid on subordinated debt 
average interest rates paid on subordinated debt outstanding decreased to during the year ended june  from during the year ended june  rates offered on subordinated debt were reduced beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have continued downward in fiscal in response to decreases in market interest rates as well as our lower cash needs 
the average issuance rate of subordinated debt at its peak  which was the month of february  was compared to the average rate of subordinated debt issued in the month of june of 
as the higher rate notes mature  we expect the average rate paid on subordinated debt to decline provided that market rates do not significantly increase 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended june  related to subordinated debt was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit and decreased interest rates paid on warehouse lines 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit were million during the year ended june   compared to million during the year ended june  this decrease was due to the increased utilization of our available cash balances and proceeds from the sale of subordinated debt to fund loan originations and greater utilization of an off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility for the sale of loans 
interest rates paid on warehouse lines are generally based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread ranging from to 
one month libor has decreased from approximately at june  to at june  provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses on available for sale loans and leases for the year ended june  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to increases in loans in non accrual status  which were generally repurchased from securitization trusts 
non accrual loans were million and million at june  and  respectively 
see managed portfolio quality for further detail 
while we are under no obligation to do so  at times we elect to repurchase delinquent loans from the securitization trusts  some of which may be in foreclosure 
we elect to repurchase loans in situations requiring more flexibility for the administration and collection of these loans in order to maximize their economic recovery and to avoid temporary discontinuations of residual or stepdown overcollateralization cash flow from securitization trusts 
the purchase price of a delinquent loan is at the loan s outstanding contractual balance 
a foreclosed loan is one where we  as servicer  have initiated formal foreclosure proceedings against the borrower and a delinquent loan is one that is days or more past due 
the foreclosed and delinquent loans we typically elect to repurchase are usually days or more delinquent and the subject of foreclosure proceedings  or where a completed foreclosure is imminent 
the related allowance for loan losses on these repurchased loans is included in our provision for credit losses in the period of repurchase 
our ability to repurchase these loans does not disqualify us for sale accounting under sfas no 
 which was adopted on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal  or other relevant accounting literature because we are not required to repurchase any loan and our ability to repurchase a loan is limited by contract 
sfas no 
was effective on a prospective basis for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  sfas requires that we record an obligation to repurchase loans from securitization trusts at the time we have the contractual right to repurchase the loans  whether or not we actually repurchase them 
for securitization trusts and forward  to which this rule applies  we have the contractual right to repurchase a limited amount of loans greater than days past due 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we have recorded on our june  balance sheet a liability of million for the repurchase of loans subject to these removal of accounts provisions  whether or not the company plans to repurchase the loans 
a corresponding asset for the loans  at the lower of their cost basis or fair value  has also been recorded

interest only strips valuation adjustment 
during fiscal  a write down through the statement of income of million was recorded on our interest only strips 
this adjustment reflects the impact of higher prepayment experience on home equity loans than anticipated during the period 
this portion of the impact of increased prepayments was considered to be other than temporary and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to earnings in the current period in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf see securitizations for further detail of this adjustment 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
for fiscal  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal growth in total revenues was mainly the result of increases in gains on the securitization of mortgage loans and increases in interest accretion earned on our interest only strips 
gain on sale of loans and leases 
for the year ended june   gains of million were recorded on the securitization of billion of loans 
this was an increase of million  or  over gains of million recorded on securitizations of billion of loans and leases for the year ended june  the increase in securitization gains was mainly due to increases in interest rate spreads  and a higher volume of loans securitized 
the securitization gain as a percentage of loans securitized increased to for the year ended june  from on loans and leases securitized for the year ended june  in addition to the increase in interest rate spreads  a lower write off for capitalized loan origination costs in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases contributed to the increase 
the increase in interest rate spread for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted from both an increase in the average interest rate on loans securitized and decreases in pass through interest rates on investor certificates issued by securitization trusts 
for loans securitized during the year ended june   the average interest rate was  an increase from on loans securitized during the year ended june  the average interest rate on trust certificates issued in mortgage loan securitizations during the year ended june  was  a decrease from during the year ended june  the resulting net improvement in interest rate spread was approximately basis points 
additionally  the improved interest rate spreads allowed us to structure the securitizations in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal in such a manner that we received more cash at the closing of the securitization than had been received in the past 
in fiscal  we received million in additional cash at the closing of securitizations than in fiscal sfas no 
requires that certain direct loan origination costs related to the time spent successfully originating loans be deferred and recorded as an addition to the cost basis of loans originated 
these costs are then recognized as a reduction of the gain on sale recorded at the time loans are securitized 
because of efficiencies and productivity gains achieved in our loan origination businesses  we had reviewed and revised our estimates of costs related to time spent successfully originating loans and had lowered the amount of employee related costs previously deferred and recorded as a reduction to securitization gains 
see employee related costs for year ended compared to year ended these increases were partially offset by an increase in the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the residual portion of interest only strips received in fiscal securitizations to from used in the securitization gain calculations in the first three quarters of fiscal changes in prepayment ramp and credit loss assumptions used in calculating securitization gains had an insignificant net impact on the change in securitization gain percentage from fiscal interest and fees 
for fiscal  interest and fee income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal interest income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was due to a modification of the terms of our third and fourth fiscal quarter securitizations  which allowed us to retain interest income we had accrued up until the point of the sale 
previously  all accrued interest income was retained by the securitization trust when collected 
in addition  the increase was attributable to an increase in our average balance of loans and leases available for sale during the period as well as an increase in the average interest rate on the loans originated during the current year 
premiums on whole loan sales increased million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the volume of whole loan sales decreased  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in the volume of whole loan sales was mainly the result of our decision to de emphasize the origination of conventional first mortgage loans  which were sold on a whole loan basis 
the decrease in volume was offset by an increase in the average premium earned on whole loan sales during this period 
other fees collected in connection with loan originations declined million primarily due to the lower volume of loans originated for whole loan sale 
interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was earned in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects the growth in the balance of our interest only strips of million  or  to million at june  from million at june  in addition  cash flows for fiscal from interest only strips increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to the larger size of our more recent securitizations  an additional three securitizations reached final target overcollateralization levels  and two securitizations reached their stepdown requirements 
servicing income 
for fiscal  servicing income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was due to the increase in the size of the managed portfolio from billion at june  to billion at june  total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as described in more detail below  this increase was a result of increased interest expense attributable to the sale of subordinated debt  increases in employee related costs  and an increase in general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million write down on the fair value of our interest only strips in fiscal no write down was required in fiscal interest expense 
for fiscal interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal average subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal was compared to during fiscal average interest rates paid on subordinated debt outstanding increased to during fiscal from during fiscal interest rates paid on subordinated debt increased in fiscal in response to increases in interest rates paid by competitors on their subordinated debt products and to enhance our ability to attract additional funds 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began reducing the interest rates paid on our subordinated debt in response to decreases in market interest rates as well as our lower cash needs 
the increase in interest expense related to subordinated debt was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit were million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal this decrease was due to the increased utilization of proceeds from the sale of subordinated debt to fund loan originations and greater utilization of off balance sheet facilities 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses on loans and leases held as available for sale for fiscal increased million  to million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to higher loan charge offs  an increase in the allowance for credit losses on non accrual loans and an increase in loans and leases available for sale 
the allowance for credit losses was million  or of gross receivables  at june  compared to million  or of gross receivables  at june  the following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan and lease type for the fiscal year ended june  in thousands business home purpose equity equipment loans loans leases total balance at beginning of period  provision for credit losses     charge offs recoveries  net    balance at end of period   the increase in charge offs was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of foreclosures on loans  moving them from non accrual status where reserves have been established  to real estate owned  where the assets are carried at the lower of cost basis or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
additionally  loan repurchases from securitization trusts increased mainly due to an increase in the size of our managed portfolio  real estate owned and delinquencies 
employee related costs 
for fiscal employee related costs increased to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a shift in the number of employees directly involved with the loan origination process into areas of loan servicing and support related to the growth in our total managed portfolio 
this shift and efficiencies and productivity gains achieved in our loan origination business have resulted in a reduction in the amount of employee related costs which were deferred and capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that certain direct loan origination costs related to the time spent successfully originating loans be deferred and recorded as an addition to the cost basis of loans originated 
these costs are then recognized as a reduction of the gain on sale recorded at the time loans are securitized 
the number of employees throughout our organization had declined by almost employees from june  to employees as of june  however  the number of employees involved in the loan origination process had declined by approximately employees over the same period of time 
because of efficiencies and productivity gains achieved in certain aspects of our loan origination business  we had reviewed and revised our estimates of the direct costs related to time spent successfully originating loans and had lowered the amount of employee related costs we defer and capitalize 
the efficiencies in our loan origination processes had come mainly from the development of technology that is now utilized to streamline certain loan origination procedures 
our development of automatic loan structuring technology provides the capability to loan officers to present potential borrowers with an array of loan options in a shorter time 
previously  the development of customized options for the borrower was a labor intensive manual effort 
in addition  our integrated loan documentation technology now allows us to save significant time preparing loan documentation  including ensuring compliance with various state and local regulations and requirements 
additionally  we had restructured our commission incentive plans for those involved in the loan origination process 
these changes had resulted in significant savings in the costs of originating loans which is not readily visible in our period to period comparative expense because many of these costs were previously deferred and capitalized 
the savings in employee related costs we were able to achieve in the loan origination areas has been dedicated to other activities and processes which are not eligible to be deferred in accordance with sfas no 
 and therefore  are being recognized as expense in the period incurred 
sales and marketing expenses 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  to million from million for fiscal expenses for direct mail advertising increased million for fiscal compared to the prior year due to increased use of targeted direct mail programs for our loan products 
these targeted programs were considered to be more cost effective than the television and radio advertising campaigns which were utilized into the second quarter of fiscal television and radio advertising costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
other marketing sources such as telemarketing and internet advertising were reduced by million in fiscal from fiscal general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately million in costs associated with servicing and collection of our larger total managed portfolio including expenses associated with reo and delinquent loans  million of expenses related to investments in internet and other technology capabilities  a million increase in costs related to loan originations  a million increase in expenses related to the sale of subordinated debt  a million charge related to the closing of branches and consolidating distribution channels through the creation of american business mortgage services  inc  a million increase in professional fees  a one time expense related to the acquisition of american business mortgage services  inc  and the costs related to continued building of support area infrastructure 
provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate increased to from in fiscal  due to an increase in state tax liabilities 
as a result of our geographic expansion  we have increased the number of states in which we are now doing significant business and have increased our tax provision for additional tax liabilities in certain states

loan and lease receivables decreased million or due to the securitization of more loans than were originated during the period 
receivables for sold loans decreased million  or  due to a greater emphasis placed on securitizing loans rather than selling loans on a whole loan basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal total liabilities increased million  or  to million from million at june  primarily due to increases in subordinated debt outstanding  accrued interest payable and other liabilities partially offset by a decrease in warehouse lines and other notes payable 
during fiscal subordinated debt increased million  or  to million due to sales of subordinated debt used to repay existing debt  to fund loan originations and our operations and for general corporate purposes including  but not limited to  repurchases of our outstanding common stock 
approximately million of the increase in subordinated debt was due to the reinvestment of accrued interest on the subordinated debt 
subordinated debt was times tangible equity at june   compared to times as of june  see liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding outstanding debt 
warehouse lines and other notes payable decreased million due to the lower balance of loan receivables held at june   and greater use of available cash to fund loans 
accrued interest payable increased million  or  to million from million at june  due to an increase in the level of subordinated debt partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates paid on debt 
deferred income taxes increased million  or  to million from million 
this increase was mainly due to higher levels of debt for tax securitization structures in the first and second quarters of fiscal as debt for tax transactions  the tax liability on securitization gains is deferred and becomes payable in future periods as cash is received from securitization trusts 
these structures created additional deferred tax credits of million which were partially offset by an increase in our federal tax loss carryforward receivable of to a cumulative million 
in addition  miscellaneous deferred tax assets increased by million and miscellaneous deferred tax credits decreased by million resulting in a net increase of million 
the net operating loss carryforward will be utilized in future periods by structuring more securitization transactions as taxable transactions

subordinated debt was times tangible equity at june   compared to times as of june  see liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding outstanding debt 
accrued interest payable increased million or  to million due to the higher level of subordinated debt and higher interest rates paid on subordinated debt 
deferred income taxes increased million  or to million from million at june  this increase was mainly due to the structuring of our first and second fiscal quarter securitizations as debt for tax transactions 
in addition  the recognition of unrealized gains in the value of our interest only strips  which are held as available for sale  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred tax

included in total delinquencies are loans in non accrual status of million  million  and million at june    and  respectively 
b it is our policy to suspend the accrual of interest income when a loan is contractually delinquent for days or more 
non accrual loans and leases are included in total delinquencies in the previously presented managed portfolio quality table 
delinquent loans and leases 
total delinquencies loans and leases with payments past due greater than days  excluding reo in the total managed portfolio were million at june  compared to million  and million at june  and  respectively 
total delinquencies as a percentage of the total managed portfolio were at june  compared to and at june  and  respectively 
the increase in delinquencies and delinquency percentages in fiscal were mainly due to the impact on our borrowers of continued uncertain economic conditions  which may include the reduction in other sources of credit to our borrowers and the seasoning of the managed portfolio 
in addition  the delinquency percentage has increased due to increased prepayment rates resulting from refinancing activities 
refinancing is not typically available to delinquent borrowers  and therefore the remaining portfolio is experiencing a higher delinquency rate 
a leveling in the growth of the managed portfolio as a result of higher prepayment rates and decreases in the origination of new loans also contributed to the increase in the delinquency percentage in fiscal from the increase in delinquencies and delinquency percentages in fiscal from was mainly due to the seasoning of the managed portfolio together with the slowing of the growth in the origination of new loans and the resulting slow down of the growth of the managed portfolio 
as the managed portfolio continues to season  and if our economy continues to lag or worsen  the delinquency rate may continue to increase 
delinquent loans and leases held as available for sale on our balance sheet increased from million at june  to million at june  primarily due to repurchases of loans from our mortgage securitization trusts 
real estate owned 
total reo  comprising foreclosed properties and deeds acquired in lieu of foreclosure  increased to million  or  of the total managed portfolio at june  compared to million  or  and million  or  at june  and  respectively 
the increase in the volume of reo was mainly due to the growth and seasoning of the managed portfolio together with a concerted effort by management to reduce the time a loan remains in seriously delinquent status until the sale of an reo property 
the acceleration of the foreclosure process had caused a substantial increase in the balance of properties classified as reo during fiscal we are now implementing processes to decrease the cycle time in the disposition of reo properties 
part of this strategy employed in the fourth quarter of fiscal includes bulk sales of reo properties as evidenced by the leveling of reo as a percentage of the managed portfolio 
we continue to add additional personnel to streamline the process of liquidating reo properties and seek opportunities such as bulk sales to decrease the time reo properties are carried 
reducing the time properties are carried reduces carrying costs for interest on funding the cost of the property  legal fees  taxes  insurance and maintenance related to these properties 
as our portfolio seasons and if our economy continues to lag or worsen  the reo balance may to continue to increase 
reo held by us on our balance sheet increased from million at june  to million at june  primarily due to repurchases of foreclosed loans from our mortgage securitization trusts 
loss experience 
during the year ended june   we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in our total managed portfolio of million 
on an annualized basis  during fiscal  net loan and lease charge offs were of the total managed portfolio 
during fiscal  we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in our total managed portfolio of million  or of the average total managed portfolio 
for fiscal  net loan and lease charge offs in our total managed portfolio were million  or of the average total managed portfolio 
principal loss severity experience on delinquent loans generally has ranged from to of principal and loss severity experience on reo generally has ranged from to of principal 
the increase in net charge offs from the prior periods were due to a larger volume of loans and leases that became delinquent  and or  were liquidated during the period as well as the seasoning of the managed portfolio 
as noted above  we have attempted to reduce the time a loan remains in seriously delinquent status until the sale of an reo property in order to reduce carrying costs on the property 
the increase in the charge off percentage was partially offset by reductions in our carrying costs due to the acceleration of the timing of the disposition of reo

see securitizations for more detail on credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our interest only strips and servicing rights compared to actual loss experience 
real estate values have generally continued to increase in recent periods and their increases have exceeded the rate of increase of many other types of investments in the current economy 
if in the future this trend reverses and real estate values begin to decline our loss severity could increase 
see risk factors a decline in the value of collateral securing our loans could result in an increase in losses on foreclosure  which could reduce our profitability and limit our ability to repay our subordinated debt for further detail of the effect that declining real estate values could have on our business 
interest rate risk management a primary market risk exposure that we face is interest rate risk 
profitability and financial performance is sensitive to changes in interest rate swap yields  us treasury yields  one month libor yields and the interest rate spread between the effective rate of interest received on loans available for sale or securitized all fixed interest rates and the interest rates paid pursuant to credit facilities or the pass through interest rate to investors for interests issued in connection with securitizations 
a substantial and sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our ability to originate and purchase loans and maintain our profitability 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management strategy is to mitigate the effects of changing interest rates on profitability and the fair value of interest rate sensitive balances primarily loans available for sale  interest only strips  servicing rights and subordinated debt 
we would address this challenge by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition and market trends and the use of hedging strategies in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
a component of our interest rate risk exposure relates to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
the structure of certain securitization trusts includes a floating interest rate certificate tranche  which pays interest based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
floating interest rate tranches in a securitization expose us to gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest only strip from changes in the floating interest rate paid to the certificate holders 
a rising interest rate environment could unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
rising interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by widening investor interest rate spread requirements in pricing future securitizations  increasing the levels of overcollateralization in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  short term and long term liquidity could also be impacted by increased interest costs on all sources of borrowed funds  including the subordinated debt  and by reducing interest rate spreads on our securitized loans  which would reduce our cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity 
the following table provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for interest only strips and servicing rights  the table presents projected principal cash flows utilizing assumptions including prepayment and credit loss rates 
see securitizations for more information on these assumptions 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in thousands amount maturing after june  months months months months months there fair to to to to to after total value rate sensitive assets loans and leases available for sale a     interest only strips         servicing rights         investments held to maturity rate sensitive liabilities fixed interest rate borrowings         average interest rate variable interest rate borrowings     average interest rate a for purposes of this table  all loans and leases which qualify for securitization are reflected as maturing within twelve months  since loans and leases available for sale are generally held for less than three months prior to securitization 
loans available for sale 
gain on sale of loans may be unfavorably impacted to the extent fixed interest rate available for sale mortgage loans are held prior to securitization 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of loans in a securitization is the interest rate spread between the average interest rate on fixed interest rate loans  and the weighted average pass through interest rate to investors for interests issued in connection with the securitization 
although the average loan interest rate is fixed at the time the loan is originated  the pass through interest rate to investors is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior to the sale of the loans 
generally  the period between loan origination and pricing of the pass through interest rate is less than months 
if market interest rates required by investors increase prior to securitization of the loans  the interest rate spread between the average interest rate on the loans and the pass through interest rate to investors may be reduced or eliminated 
this factor could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we estimate that each reduction in the interest rate spread reduces the gain on sale of loans as a percentage of loans securitized by approximately 
see strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further detail of our interest rate risk management for available for sale loans 
interest only strips and servicing rights 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by certain securitization trusts are floating interest rate certificates based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates 
at june   million of debt issued by loan securitization trusts was floating interest rate certificates based on one month libor  representing of total debt issued by mortgage loan securitization trusts 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the changes in fair value are generally recognized as part of net adjustments to other comprehensive income  which is a component of retained earnings 
as of june   the interest rate sensitivity for million of floating interest rate certificates issued by securitization trusts is managed with an interest rate swap contract effectively fixing our cost for this debt 
see strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further detail 
a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of loan prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and the related projected cash flows 
we attempt to minimize prepayment risk on interest only strips and servicing rights by requiring prepayment fees on business loans and home equity loans  where permitted by law 
currently  approximately of business loans and of home equity loans in the total managed portfolio are subject to prepayment fees 
however  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments could result in a write down of the fair value of related interest only strips and servicing rights  adversely impacting earnings during the period of adjustment 
revaluation of our interest only strips and servicing rights is periodically performed 
as part of the revaluation process  assumptions used for prepayment rates are monitored against actual experience and adjusted if warranted 
see securitizations for further information regarding these assumptions and the impact of prepayments during this period 
subordinated debt 
we also experience interest rate risk to the extent that as of june  approximately million of our liabilities were comprised of fixed interest rate subordinated debt with scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
to the extent that market interest rates demanded for subordinated debt increase in the future  the interest rates paid on replacement debt could exceed interest rates currently paid thereby increasing interest expense and reducing net income 
strategies for use of derivative financial instruments 
from time to time derivative financial instruments are utilized in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates between the date loans are originated and the date the fixed interest rate pass through certificates to be issued by a securitization trust are priced 
generally  the period between loan origination and pricing of the pass through interest rate is less than months 
derivative financial instruments we use for hedging changes in fair value due to interest rate changes may include interest rate swaps  futures and forward contracts 
the nature and quantity of hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan originations and purchases 
at the time the contract is executed  derivative contracts are specifically designated as hedges of mortgage loans or our residual interests in mortgage loans in our mortgage conduit facility  which we would expect to be included in a term securitization at a future date 
the mortgage loans and mortgage loans underlying residual interests in mortgage pools consist of essentially similar pools of fixed interest rate loans  collateralized by real estate primarily residential real estate with similar maturities and similar credit characteristics 
fixed interest rate pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts are generally priced to yield an interest rate spread above interest rate swap yield curves with maturities to match the maturities of the interest rate pass through certificates 
we may hedge potential interest rate changes in interest rate swap yield curves with eurodollar futures  forward treasury sales  interest rate swaps or derivative contracts of similar underlying securities 
this practice has provided strong correlation between our hedge contracts and the ultimate pricing we will receive on the subsequent securitization 
the unrealized gain or loss derived from these derivative financial instruments  which are designated as fair value hedges  is reported in earnings as it occurs with an offsetting adjustment to the fair value of the item hedged 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments are based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of the items hedged are based on current pricing of these assets in a securitization 
cash flow related to hedging activities is reported as it occurs 
the effectiveness of our hedges are continuously monitored 
if correlation did not exist  the related gain or loss on the hedged item would no longer be recognized as an adjustment to income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge designation  changes in the fair value of a derivative are either offset against the change in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in the fair value will be recognized in earnings immediately 
sfas no 
was effective on a prospective basis for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on july  resulted in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of thousand pre tax being recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  due to the immateriality of the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 the thousand pre tax expense is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the tax effects and earnings per share amounts related to the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
are not material 
we recorded cash losses on the fair value of derivative financial instruments of million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively  which were offset by securitization gains during the periods 
any ineffectiveness related to hedging transactions during the periods was immaterial 
ineffectiveness is a measure of the difference in the change in fair value of the derivative financial instrument as compared to the change in the fair value of the item hedged 
there were no derivative contracts accounted for as hedges at june  or outstanding derivative contracts by items hedged and associated unrealized losses as of june  were as follows in thousands eurodollar forward futures treasury contracts sales total loans available for sale notional amount   unrealized losses mortgage conduit facility assets notional amount    unrealized losses loan commitments notional amount    unrealized losses total notional amount    unrealized losses in addition to the above derivative contracts  at june   we had an obligation to satisfy a mortgage securitization prefund requirement of million  which was satisfied in july there were no such obligations at june  or generally  we do not enter into derivative financial instrument contracts for trading purposes 
however  we have entered into a derivative financial instrument contract  which we have not designated as an accounting hedge and is therefore accounted for as a trading asset or liability 
this contract was designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
the structure of certain securitization trusts includes a floating interest rate tranche based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
floating interest rate tranches in a securitization expose us to gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest only strip from changes in the floating interest rate paid to the certificate holders 
in order to manage this exposure we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to lock in a fixed interest rate on our third quarter fiscal securitization s variable rate tranche 
the swap agreement requires a net cash settlement on a monthly basis of the difference between the fixed interest rate on the swap and the libor paid on the certificates 
the fair value of this swap agreement is based on estimated market values for the sale of the contract provided by a third party 
for the year ended june   we recorded million in losses on this swap contract due to decreases in the interest rate swap yield curve 
of the total losses recognized during the period  million are unrealized losses representing the net change in the fair value of the contract at june  and million are cash losses 
the net unrealized loss of million is included in other liabilities 
our interest only strips are held as available for sale securities and therefore changes in the fair value of the interest only strips are recorded as a component of equity unless the fair value of the interest only strips falls below its cost basis  which would require a write down through current period income 
terms of the interest rate swap agreement at june  were as follows dollars in thousands notional amount  rate received floating a rate paid fixed maturity date april unrealized loss sensitivity to change in interest rates a rate represents the spot rate for one month libor paid on the securitized floating interest rate tranche at the end of the period 
derivative transactions are measured in terms of a notional amount  but this notional amount is not carried on the balance sheet 
the notional amount is not exchanged between counterparties to the derivative financial instrument  but  is only used as a basis to determine fair value  which is recorded on the balance sheet  and to determine interest and other payments between the counterparties 
our exposure to credit risk in a derivative transaction is represented by the fair value of those derivative financial instruments in a gain position 
we attempt to manage this exposure by limiting our derivative financial instruments to those traded on major exchanges and our counterparties are major financial institutions 
at june   we held no derivative financial instruments in a gain position 
in the future  we may expand the types of derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk to include other types of derivative contracts 
however  an effective interest rate risk management strategy is complex and no such strategy can completely insulate us from interest rate changes 
poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than mitigate risk 
hedging involves transaction and other costs that could increase as the period covered by the hedging protection increases 
although it is expected that such costs would be offset by income realized from securitizations in that period or in future periods  we may be prevented from effectively hedging fixed interest rate loans held for sale without reducing income in current or future periods 
in addition  while eurodollar rates  interest rate swap yield curves and the pass through interest rate of securitizations are generally strongly correlated  this correlation has not held in periods of financial market disruptions eg the so called russian crisis in the later part of 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding to meet our short and long term cash needs 
we have used a substantial portion of our funding sources to build our managed portfolio and investments in securitization residual assets with the expectation that they will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to cover our operating requirements  including repayment of maturing subordinated debt 
our cash needs change as the managed portfolio grows  as our interest only strips grow and release more cash  as subordinated debt matures  as operating expenses change and revenues increase 
because we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations  our business requires continual access to short and long term sources of debt to generate the cash required to fund our operations 
our cash requirements include funding loan originations and capital expenditures  repaying existing subordinated debt  paying interest expense and operating expenses  and in connection with our securitizations  funding overcollateralization requirements and servicer obligations 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock and could in the future use cash for unspecified acquisitions of related businesses or assets although no acquisitions are currently contemplated

the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the discussion of the application of critical accounting policies 
when loans are sold through a securitization  we retain the rights to service the loans 
as the servicer of securitized loans we are obligated to advance interest payments for delinquent loans if we deem that the advances will ultimately be recoverable 
these advances can first be made out of funds available in the trusts collection account  then from our operating cash if there are insufficient funds in the trusts collection account 
these advances  including those made from the trusts collection account  which if not recovered from the borrower or proceeds from the liquidation of the loan  require reimbursement from us 
these advances may require funding from our capital resources and may create greater demands on our cash flow than either selling loans with servicing released or maintaining a portfolio of loans on balance sheet 
however  these advances have priority of repayment from the succeeding month s mortgage loan payments to the trusts 
while we are under no obligation to do so  at times we elect to repurchase delinquent loans from the securitization trusts  some of which may be in foreclosure 
we elect to repurchase loans in situations requiring more flexibility for the administration and collection of these loans in order to maximize their economic recovery and to avoid temporary discontinuations of residual or stepdown overcollateralization cash flow from securitization trusts 
the purchase price of a delinquent loan is at the loan s outstanding contractual balance 
a foreclosed loan is one where we  as servicer  have initiated formal foreclosure proceedings against the borrower and a delinquent loan is one that is days or more past due 
the foreclosed and delinquent loans we typically elect to repurchase are usually days or more delinquent and the subject of completed foreclosure proceedings  or where a completed foreclosure is imminent 
the related allowance for loan losses for these repurchased loans is included in our provision for credit losses in the period of repurchase 
our ability to repurchase these loans does not disqualify us for sale accounting under sfas no 
or other relevant accounting literature because we are not required to repurchase any loan and our ability to repurchase a loan is limited by contract 
see results of operations summary of loans repurchased from mortgage loan securitization trusts for further detail of our repurchase activity 
cash flow from operations  the issuance of subordinated debt  and lines of credit fund our operating cash needs 
loan originations are funded through borrowings against warehouse credit facilities and sales into an off balance sheet facility 
each funding source is described in more detail below 
cash flow from operations 
one of our corporate goals is to achieve positive cash flow from operations 
however  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our projections regarding declining negative cash flow or positive cash flow from operations 
the achievement of this goal is dependent on our ability to o manage levels of securitizations to maximize cash flows cash received at closing and subsequently from interest only strips and servicing rights  o continue to grow a portfolio of mortgage loans which will ultimately generate income and cash flows through our servicing activities and the residual interests we hold in the securitized loans  o build on our established approaches to underwriting loans  servicing and collecting loans and managing credit risks in order to control delinquency and losses  o continue to invest in technology and other efficiencies to reduce per unit costs in our loan originations and servicing process  and o control overall expense increases 
our cash flow from operations is negatively impacted by a number of factors 
the growth of our loan originations negatively impacts our cash flow from operations because we must bear the expenses of the origination but generally do not recover the cash outflow from these expenses until we securitize or sell the underlying loans 
with respect to loans securitized  we may be required to wait more than one year to recover the cash outflow from loan origination expenses through cash inflows from our residual assets retained in securitization 
a second factor  which negatively impacts our cash flow  is an increase in market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  the interest rates that investors demand on the certificates issued by securitization trusts will also increase 
the increase in interest rates paid to investors reduces the cash we will receive from our interest only strips 
although we may have the ability  in a rising interest rate market  to charge higher loan interest rates to our borrowers  competition  laws and regulations and other factors may limit or delay our ability to do so 
even though our loan origination and servicing operations have expanded during fiscal  negative cash flow from operations decreased million  or  for the year ended june  from the prior year 
cash flow from operations for the year ended june  was a negative million 
although we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue in the foreseeable future  our goal is to continue to reduce our negative cash flow from operations from historical levels and then we expect that our cash flow from operations will become positive 
however  negative cash flow from operations in the next fiscal year may increase from fiscal because due to the nature of our operations  we generally expect the level of cash flow from operations to fluctuate 
the extent of progress in the future compared to the decrease in negative cash flow in fiscal depends on the items discussed below 
the decline in negative cash flow from operations for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   has been achieved through a combination of items 
in addition to our focus on controlling overall expense increases and realizing efficiencies from our investments in systems and technology most significantly in our loan origination areas  the improvement of our cash flow from operations was attributable to three significant factors 
first  the cash flow we received from our interest only strips grew by million in fiscal from fiscal due to increases in our securitized portfolio of loans which continue to grow and previous securitizations begin to provide us with additional residual cash and overcollateralization cash 
second  due to increases in interest rate spreads received in our securitizations during fiscal  we were able to structure our securitization transactions to provide additional cash at the closing of the securitization through the sale of trust certificates to investors at a premium or through the sale of notional bonds 
in fiscal  we received million of additional cash at the closing of our securitizations from the sale of loans at a premium or through the sale of notional bonds compared to million in fiscal we do not expect to be able to maintain the levels of cash we received at the closing of fiscal securitizations unless market interest rates remain at  or near  the levels noted throughout fiscal  the market is willing to accept the structure and we can maintain the interest rate spreads achieved in the fiscal securitizations 
third  in fiscal  we sold an additional million of loan receivables through securitizations and whole loan sales  which were held as available for sale at the end of fiscal the proceeds from this sale increased our operating cash flow in the current year 
we do not expect that we would reduce our existing available for sale portfolio in the future 
although negative cash flow from operations in future periods may increase from the level experienced in fiscal  we believe that if our business projections prove accurate  negative cash flow will decline and we will ultimately achieve positive cash flow from operations in the future 
as was previously discussed  during the year ended june   our actual prepayment experience on our managed portfolio was generally higher than our average historical levels for prepayments 
prepayments result in decreases in the size of our managed portfolio and decreases in the expected future cash flows to us from our interest only strips and servicing rights 
however  due to the favorable interest rate spreads  favorable overcollateralization requirements and levels of cash received at closing on our more recent securitizations we do not believe our recent increase in prepayment experience will have a significant impact on our expected cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
borrowings against warehouse credit facilities represent cash advanced to us for a limited duration  generally no more than days  and are secured by loan receivables 
these credit facilities provide the primary funding source for loan originations 
the ultimate sale of the loans through securitization or whole loan sale generates the cash proceeds necessary to repay the borrowings under the warehouse facilities 
we also have a committed mortgage conduit facility  which enables us to sell our loans into an off balance sheet facility 
in addition  we have the availability of revolving credit facilities  which may be used to fund our operations 
these credit facilities are generally extended for a one year term before the renewal of the facility must be re approved by the lender 
we periodically review our expected future credit needs and negotiate credit commitments for those needs as well as excess capacity in order to allow us flexibility in the timing of the securitization of our loans 
the following is a description of the warehouse and operating lines of credit and mortgage conduit facilities which were available to us at june  amount amount amount utilized on utilized off committed balance sheet balance sheet in thousands revolving credit and conduit facilities mortgage conduit facility  expiring july a  na  warehouse revolving line of credit  expiring november b

f million revolving line of credit facility from firstrust savings bank

the interest rate on the advances from this facility is one month libor plus a margin 
g the commercial paper conduit for lease production provided for sale of equipment leases using a pooled securitization 
after january  the facility was no longer available for sales of equipment leases 
the warehouse credit agreements require that we maintain specific financial covenants regarding net worth  leverage  net income  liquidity  total debt and other standards 
each agreement has multiple individualized financial covenant thresholds and ratio limits  which we must meet to enable us to continue to draw on that particular line of credit 
at june   we were in compliance with the terms of all financial covenants 
some of our financial covenants have minimal flexibility and we cannot say with certainty that we will continue to comply with the terms of all debt covenants 
if we do not comply with the debt covenants in one of our credit facilities  we can utilize excess capacity in our other credit facilities for loan funding  request a waiver from our lender or request a renegotiation of the terms of the agreement in order to allow us to continue to draw down on the facility 
while there can be no assurance that a waiver or modification of terms would be granted us should one be requested  in fiscal we did ask for and obtained a modification of certain financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities with residential funding corporation and triple a one funding corp 
subordinated debt securities 
the issuance of subordinated debt funds the majority of our remaining operating cash requirements 
we rely significantly on our ability to issue subordinated debt since our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements 
in order to expand our businesses we have issued subordinated debt to partially fund growth and to partially fund maturities of subordinated debt 
in addition  at times we may elect to utilize proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt to fund loans instead of using our warehouse credit facilities  depending on our determination of liquidity needs 
during fiscal  we sold million in principal amount of subordinated debt securities  net of redemptions compared to million in fiscal the debt had maturities of up to ten years with an average maturity of months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal the reduction in the level of subordinated debt sold was a result of our focus on becoming cash flow positive and reducing our reliance on subordinated debt 
we registered million of subordinated debt under a registration statement  which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  as of june   million of this debt was available for future issuance 
we are in the process of registering a new offering for an additional million of subordinated debt 
there can be no assurance given as to when the securities and exchange commission will declare this registration statement effective 
we intend to meet our obligation to repay such debt and interest as it matures with cash flow from operations  cash flows from interest only strips and cash generated from additional debt financing 
the utilization of funds for the repayment of such obligations should not adversely affect operations 
our cash balances are sufficient to cover approximately of the million of subordinated debt and accrued interest maturities due within one year 
cash balances were million at june   up from million at june  the current low interest rate environment has provided an opportunity to reduce the interest rates and extend the maturities offered on our subordinated debt 
the weighted average interest rate of our subordinated debt issued in the month of june was and of that debt was for terms of months or longer  compared to debt issued in june which had a weighted average interest rate of and with terms of months or longer 
debt issued at our peak rate  which was in february  was at a rate of and only was for terms of months or longer 
sales into special purpose entities and off balance sheet facilities 
we continue to significantly rely on access to the asset backed securities market through securitizations to provide permanent funding of our loan production 
asset securitizations are one of the most common off balance sheet arrangements to apply special purpose entities  such as securitization trusts  in their structures 
the securitization trusts sell certificates to third party investors which generate cash proceeds for the repayment of borrowings under warehouse and credit facilities 
the off balance sheet trusts activities are restricted to holding title to the loan collateral  issuing certificates to investors and distributing loan payments to the investors and us in accordance with the agreement 
we also retain the right to service the loans 
residual cash from the loans after required principal and interest payments are made to the investors provide us with cash flows from our interest only strips 
it is our expectation that future cash flows from our interest only strips and servicing rights will generate more of the cash flows required to meet maturities of our subordinated debt and our operating cash needs 
as of june  and  there are loans with an aggregate principal balance of billion and billion in separate off balance sheet entities which have billion and billion in investor certificates outstanding  respectively 
we have no additional obligations to the off balance sheet facilities other than those required as servicer of the loans and are not required to make any additional investments in the trusts 
see securitizations summary of selected mortgage loan securitization trust information for detail of the composition of each securitization trust 
other liquidity considerations 
a failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under a warehouse credit or conduit facility  offerings of subordinated debt  or any substantial reduction in the size or pricing in the markets for loans  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing  we may have to curtail loan production activities or sell loans rather than securitize them  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our loan originations are non conforming mortgages to subprime borrowers 
some participants in the non conforming mortgage industry have experienced greater than anticipated losses on their securitization interest only strips and servicing rights due to the effects of increased delinquencies  increased credit losses and increased prepayment rates 
as a result  some competitors have exited the business or have recorded valuation allowances or write downs for these conditions 
due to these circumstances  some participants experienced restricted access to capital required to fund loan originations and have been precluded from participation in the asset backed securitization market 
however  we have maintained our ability to obtain funding and to securitize loans 
factors that have minimized the effect of adverse market conditions on our business include our ability to originate loans through established retail channels  focus on credit underwriting  assess prepayment fees on loans  diversify lending in the home equity and business loan markets and raise capital through sales of subordinated debt securities pursuant to a registered public offering 
subject to economic  market and interest rate conditions  we intend to continue to transact additional securitizations for future loan originations 
any delay or impairment in our ability to securitize loans  as a result of market conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
our june securitization was structured as a senior subordinated certificate structure which provides credit enhancement for senior certificates by the subordinated certificates 
this structure provided us with lower overcollateralization requirements among other benefits 
we have been notified that we do not qualify as a select servicer under some of the financial requirements of a rating agency 
if we desire to enter into future securitizations structured as senior subordinated certificate transactions  we will be required to enter into an agreement with an alternate servicer who would  among other responsibilities  assume our responsibilities for servicing that securitization trust s loans should we be unable to fulfill our servicing obligations 
we do not anticipate that this servicing agreement requirement will limit our ability to structure future securitizations as a senior subordinated structure or that the additional cost to structure such securitizations would be material 
additionally  other structures could be available to us including an insured structure  which is the structure of our securitizations from to march of a further decline in economic conditions  continued instability in financial markets or further acts of terrorism in the united states may cause disruption in our business and operations including reductions in demand for our loan products and our subordinated debt securities  increases in delinquencies and credit losses in our managed loan portfolio  changes in historical prepayment patterns and declines in real estate collateral values 
to the extent the united states experiences an economic downturn  unusual economic patterns and unprecedented behaviors in financial markets  these developments may affect our ability to originate loans at profitable interest rates  to price future loan securitizations profitably and to effectively hedge our loan portfolio against market interest rate changes which could cause reduced profitability 
should these disruptions and unusual activities occur  our profitability and cash flow could be reduced and our ability to make principal and interest payments on our subordinated debt could be impaired 
related party transactions we have a loan receivable from our chairman and chief executive officer  anthony j 
santilli  for million  which was an advance for the exercise of stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock in the loan is due in september earlier if the stock is disposed of 
interest at is payable annually 
the loan is secured by  shares of our common stock  and is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in our financial statements 
on april   we awarded  shares of our common stock to richard kaufman  our director  as a result of services rendered in connection with our stock repurchases 
we employ members of the immediate family of some of our directors and executive officers in various non corporate executive positions 
we believe that the salaries we pay these individuals are competitive with salaries paid to other employees in similar positions in our organization and in our industry 
additionally  we have business relationships with other related parties  including family members of directors and officers  through which we have purchased appraisal services  office equipment and real estate advisory services 
none of our related party transactions  individually or collectively  are material to our results of operations 
office facilities we lease our corporate headquarters facilities in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania under a five year operating lease expiring in july at a minimum annual rental of approximately million 
we lease additional space in bala cynwyd under a five year lease expiring november at an annual rental of approximately million 
we also lease a facility in roseland  new jersey under an operating lease expiring july at an annual rental of million 
the roseland lease has a renewal provision at an increased annual rental 
in addition  branch offices are leased on a short term basis in various cities throughout the united states 
the leases for the branch offices are not material to operations 
recent accounting pronouncements set forth below are accounting pronouncements that may have a future effect on operations 
the following descriptions or recent pronouncements should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies  which have been adopted that are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
see interest rate risk management strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for a discussion of the impact of sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
 also titled accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
sfas no 
s standards are based on consistent application of a financial components approach that focuses on control 
under that approach  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished 
this statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
sfas no 
was effective on a prospective basis for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  this statement was effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june  did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
however  the new standard requires that we record the obligation to repurchase loans from securitization trusts at the time we have the contractual right to repurchase loans whether or not we actually repurchase the loans 
these rights to repurchase loans are recorded in loan receivables available for sale  at the estimated fair value of the loans with a corresponding obligation in other liabilities at the loans outstanding principal balance  which would be the repurchase price of the loan should we choose to repurchase the loan 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the accounting of intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in financial statements upon their acquisition  and the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  sfas no 
requires additional financial statement disclosure for goodwill and other intangibles 
under the new standard  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life was discontinued 
after a transitional impairment test  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the provisions of sfas no 
were required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  early application was permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march  we adopted the new standard on july  because our goodwill is no longer being amortized  the reported amounts of goodwill will not decrease at the same time and in the same manner as under previous standards 
there may be more volatility in reported income than under previous standards because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
as of july   we performed a transitional impairment test  which did not indicate impairment of goodwill under the provisions of the new standard 
for the year ended june  and  we recorded amortization of goodwill in the amount of million and million  respectively 
adjusted to exclude amortization of goodwill  net income and diluted net income per share for the year ended june  were million and and for the year ended june  were million and  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements 
the proposal provides guidance on consolidation by a business enterprise of special purpose entities  referred to as spe s 
the proposal defines the primary beneficiary of an spe as a business enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in the spe 
the proposal requires that the primary beneficiary of an spe consolidate an spe s assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the spe in their financial statements and provide certain disclosures regarding both consolidated and unconsolidated spe s 
spe s whose structures effectively disburse risk would not be required to be consolidated by any party 
although we use spe s extensively in our loan securitization activities  the proposal  if adopted as written  will not affect our current consolidation policies for spe s 
the proposed interpretation does not change the guidance incorporated in sfas no 
which precludes consolidation of a qualifying spe by a transferor of assets to that spe 
the proposal as currently contemplated will therefore have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations and would not be expected to effect it in the future
