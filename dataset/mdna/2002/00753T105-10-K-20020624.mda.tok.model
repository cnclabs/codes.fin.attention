table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended march  amounted to million  or per diluted share on net sales of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share on net sales of million for the previous fiscal year 
the or million increase in net sales generally can be attributed to the following factors a million increase as a result of the acquisition of publishers group west  incorporated pgw on january   a million increase in sales from international subsidiaries  primarily in our united kingdom subsidiary  and an million or increase in domestic shipments to core customers 
we experienced a return rate from customers in fiscal  compared to a return rate of in the previous fiscal year 
the percentage point increase can be primarily attributed to the lack of bestseller authors in absolute dollars 
fewer bestsellers caused lower gross sales  which magnified the return percentage of product returned for sale 
this also makes return rates riskier  due to an increase in the placement of second tier authors  which increases the risk factor for potential returns 
consistent with historical practice  returns reserves have been established based on management s best estimate of expected future product returns 
these return reserves are included in the aforementioned return figures 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal compared with in the previous fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to strong sales in ams publishing division  increases in revenue from international subsidiaries  two months of high margin sales from pgw and improved inventory management 
distribution and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses rose to from  a percentage point increase 
this increase was primarily due to expenditures reflecting our continuing efforts to diversify our worldwide customer base and our commitment to build the infrastructure required to address heightened business requirements on a global level 
contributing to the percentage point increase were a percentage point increase related to variable labor costs at our distribution centers as a result of our increased pic n pac business and expansion of our distribution centers  million related to facilities expansions at two of our distribution centers  million related to payroll costs resulting from our continued investment in staffing  and million related to various increases in other fixed operating costs  including depreciation  amortization and promotions expense 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in the previous fiscal year as a result of utilizing available investment resources to fund operations and the acquisition of pgw 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense and other amounted to million for the year ended march   which related primarily to a million charge representing the change in fair value associated with stock appreciation rights issued in connection with certain acquisitions and million of interest expense incurred on our lines of credit 
our combined federal and state effective tax rate remained consistent at for each of the fiscal years ended march  and 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million  or per diluted share on net sales of million 
this compared to net income of million  or per diluted share on net sales of million for the fiscal year 
the increase in net sales can be attributed primarily to increases in gross shipments to core customers and  to a lesser extent  the ramping up of our new sales relationship with the borders group and increased sales from international divisions 
we experienced a rate of returns from customers in fiscal  consistent with the fiscal rate 
this can be attributed to the continuing effectiveness of our proprietary vmi software 
consistent with historical practice  returns reserves have been established based on management s best estimate of expected future product returns 
these return reserves are included in the aforementioned return figures 
gross profit for fiscal reached million  an increase of million from the fiscal level 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared with in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily a result of increased sales of higher margin juvenile and ams published books as well as reduced sales of lower margin bestsellers 
additional margin contribution came from our international subsidiaries and publisher incentive programs due in part to a refinement in our method of estimating income under these programs 
distribution and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  these expenses rose to from for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to our continuing goal to diversify our worldwide customer base  our commitment to build the infrastructure required to address heightened business requirements on a global level and a million increase in existing reserves for receivables due to a customer s filing for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the infrastructure costs included hiring for key new positions and increased depreciation expense related to systems enhancements and facility expansions 
interest and dividend income increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous fiscal year as a result of higher yields within the investment portfolio 
see liquidity and capital resources 
our combined federal and state effective tax rate increased to in fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the fiscal provision for income tax was higher due primarily to a lower impact of tax exempt investment income 

table of contents seasonality as is the case for many retailers  our business is seasonal  with the highest net sales and earnings occurring in our third fiscal quarter 
income from operations during the third fiscal quarter  as a percentage of net sales  is typically higher than in any other quarter because of product sales mix and other economies of scale caused by the higher sales volume 
this seasonal pattern reflects the increased demand for books and related media experienced during the holiday selling season 
working capital requirements are generally highest during the second and early part of the third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our business 
we experience significant seasonal short term swings in our cash position due to sales seasonality and to differences in timing of payments to our vendors and the receipt of payments from our customers 
cash flow has been historically greatest during the third fiscal quarter due to higher seasonal sales 
our results of operations depend significantly upon net sales generated during the third fiscal quarter  and any significant adverse trend in the net sales of such period would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the full fiscal year 
we expect seasonality in operations to continue 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march   operating activities provided million of cash 
in the prior year  operating activities provided million of cash 
at march   our cash and cash equivalents had decreased by million compared to march   primarily due to funding of two acquisitions and the strategic growth of our corporate infrastructure offset  in part  by income from operations 
trade accounts receivable increased million  net of provision for uncollectible accounts and sales returns  compared to one year ago due to general increases in net sales over the prior year 
inventories at march  increased million compared to march   due to increased sales and effects of exchange rates on the translation of inventory from our international subsidiaries 
accounts payable at march  increased by million over march   due primarily to increased purchases to support increased sales 
the working capital required to finance inventories is directly related to inventory turnover rate and trade credit terms provided by publishers 
trade credit terms from our vendors did not change significantly during fiscal inventory turns increased to times in fiscal from times in fiscal for fiscal  the inventory turn was calculated using cost of goods sold from operations excluding the two months of cost of goods sold relating to pgw for comparability 
pgw holds inventory on consignment 
the improvement in inventory turns is a result of purchasing efficiencies gained from a better understanding of our customers needs through the use of our proprietary vendor managed inventory software vmi program and improved inventory management 
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended march  amounted to million 
we used million to fund two acquisitions as follows million to acquire pgw and million to acquire an equity interest in templar as part of our strategic plan to grow in diversified higher margin businesses 
capital investments  related to our efforts to expand our distribution capacity and efficiency and to upgrade our management information systems  used million in cash 
financing activities provided net cash of million for the fiscal year ended march   million represented borrowings against our lines of credit 
we have initiated a strategic growth plan designed to capitalize upon our core competency of book wholesaling that is intended to allow us to grow our business into market segments that historically have higher margins and reduce our reliance on our two largest customers 
this strategic plan requires us to upgrade and realign our existing facility capacity and management information systems  which we intend to fund through current cash reserves  borrowings against our existing line of credit  and anticipated cash flows from future operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued for the fiscal year ended march   we made capital investments of approximately million that related to our efforts to upgrade our management information systems  and also expand our distribution capacity and efficiency 
during the prior fiscal year  we made capital investments related to these projects of approximately million 
these capital assets consist mainly of computer hardware and software and internal costs related to the enhancement of our management information systems  distribution equipment  and leasehold improvements 
of the million spent in fiscal  excluding assets acquired as part of the pgw acquisition that totaled approximately million  million was related to our management information systems enhancements  million related to our distribution center expansions and additional activity at our warehouse locations  and million related to ongoing capital expenditure activity at all of our locations worldwide 
cumulative expenditures related to the systems implementation amounted to approximately million at march  all accumulated costs related to these assets not yet placed in service will be depreciated on a straight line basis over a seven year period when the system is placed in service  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal for fiscal  we expect worldwide depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million  which is inclusive of a partial year of depreciation expense related to the aforementioned systems enhancements 
we anticipate  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  to recognize cost efficiencies relating to these systems enhancements 
as usual  we will be focusing all efforts to service our customers during the holiday season  which falls during our third fiscal quarter 
we lease facilities and some equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
rent expense for the years ended march   and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the leases have initial expiration dates ranging from to some of the leases contain renewal options  termination options and periodic adjustments of the minimum monthly rental payments 
total future minimum lease commitments amount to approximately million based upon existing lease agreements and expiration  with approximate annual rent payments of million for fiscal as announced april   our board of directors approved an annual dividend payment of per share 
on march   we paid approximately million to stockholders of record on march  on january   our existing unsecured million line of credit was amended  principally to revise certain financial covenants 
at that time  we also entered into a new secured revolving credit agreement with the same financial institution 
the secured revolving credit agreement  as amended on january   provides for up to million through june  and million thereafter through the august  maturity date  secured by eligible accounts receivable 
borrowings under both revolving credit agreements bear interest at the bank s prime rate or libor at march  we are required to pay an unused loan fee of of on any portion of the loan that is available but not drawn 
fees paid during the year ended march  totaled approximately the credit facilities contain certain covenants which  among other things  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios on a quarterly and annual basis 
the key ratios include tangible net worth  senior debt to ebitda  leverage and current ratios 
accounts receivable balances must be in excess of the outstanding balance on the secured line of credit 
borrowings under the secured revolving credit agreement are collateralized by all of our accounts receivable 
we had outstanding borrowings of million with an additional million available  but not drawn  at march  under our bank lines of credit 
as of and during the year ended march   we had no borrowings outstanding on the unsecured bank line of credit 
although there can be no assurances given  we currently intend to refinance our lines of credit prior to their august  maturity on terms that we anticipate will be comparable to those currently in existence 
we currently have no commitments as such 
in the event that we were unable to refinance the lines of credit prior to that time  or were only able to refinance on substantially less favorable terms and conditions  it would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our existing working capital  cash flows from operations  trade credit traditionally available from our vendors  and refinancing of our existing lines of credit and other sources of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to cover debt service costs and any reasonably foreseeable future working capital and capital expenditure requirements associated with our existing operations 
although we have no acquisition commitments at the present time  we continue to consider additional strategic acquisitions where deemed appropriate 
such acquisitions  if any  could materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued we are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business and management believes that the outcome of these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our policies require the application of management judgement in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgement in determining such estimates and assumptions is by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ from estimates made 
our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon delivery of merchandise to customer locations for our wholesale distribution business and upon shipment to the customer for our contract distribution business  in accordance with our respective shipping terms 
we record expenses related to our co op advertising activities  offset by reimbursements from publishers  within distribution and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
included in our net sales are primarily sales of product  principally books  and to a lesser extent music cds  cd roms and prerecorded audiocassettes 
our net sales also incorporate offsets for discounts  allowances  rebates  sales returns and sales returns provisions 
consistent with industry practice  significant portions of our products are sold to customers with the right of return 
the level of actual returns can be influenced by many factors  including the quality of title selection  the strength and availability of the titles  as well as volatility of the ultimate sell through in the retail marketplace 
in recording adjustments to sales for estimated returns  we consider these factors as well as historical return patterns of the titles  reports of the quantities of titles at our customer locations from our vmi system  and industry trends 
actual product returns may differ from our estimates 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to pay amounts owed 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  we may be required to record additional allowances or write off all or a portion of the amount due us 
we recognize revenue on a gross basis  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no

this statement establishes reporting standards for revenue and costs of sales depending on a number of factors or characteristics 
the characteristics indicative of gross revenue reporting include whether the company is the primary obligor  has latitude in establishing price  can determine product specification  has credit and physical loss inventory risk

a majority of our inventories carry the right of return to publishers 
as of march  and  approximately and  respectively  of our inventories carried the right of return to publishers 
for the portion of our inventories that do not have the right of return  we estimate  based upon historical results and our evaluation of current conditions  a provision for the markdown of inventories 
pgw carries inventory on consignment 

table of contents critical accounting policies continued impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of requires that impairment losses be recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
our policy is to evaluate  at each balance sheet date  the appropriateness of the carrying values of long lived assets on the basis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors 
if such evaluation were to indicate an impairment of these assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the asset to its estimated fair value 
impact of inflation we have been subject to relatively low prevailing inflation rates in all countries in which we operate  with the exception of mexico  during fiscal  and we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices in all countries in which we operate to offset increased costs of merchandise and we expect to be able to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
while our mexico operations are not a significant part of our overall activities  the continued high rates of inflation in mexico may result in future foreign currency exchange losses

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to changes in interest rates primarily from securities held in our investment portfolio 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the ending fair value of our investments  anticipated future cash flows  and the realization of earnings from such investments 
our cash and cash equivalents typically consist of highly liquid short term investments that are typically held for the duration of the respective instrument 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our cash equivalents 
as of march   our investments of approximately million are scheduled to mature within one year and approximately million are scheduled to mature within one to three years 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions  or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
accordingly  we believe that  while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
we are subject to foreign currency exposure due to the operation of our foreign subsidiaries  which generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exposure are the british pound  mexican peso  and the australian and canadian dollar 
we generally view as long term our investments in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not utilize any hedging transactions against these net investments 
we believe that the risk associated with our foreign currency exposure is not material on a consolidated basis 
although there can be no assurance  we currently intend to refinance our lines of credit prior to their august  maturity on terms that we anticipate will be comparable to those currently in existence 
we currently have no commitments to do so 
in the event that we were unable to refinance the lines of credit prior to that time  or were only able to refinance on substantially less favorable terms and conditions  it would materially affect our liquidity or capital resources
