item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of our proprietary technologies  primarily the origen technology for the clinical diagnostic  life science and industrial markets 
we currently derive a majority of our revenue from royalties received from licensees that develop and market certain origen based systems 
we also generate sales of our own products  particularly the m series system and related consumable reagents 
we may selectively pursue additional strategic alliances  which could result in additional license fees or contract revenues 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development  manufacturing scale up and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
as a result  we will need to generate higher revenue from present levels to achieve profitability 
results of operations years ended march  and revenues 
total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by approximately million or to million from million in fiscal the revenue growth for fiscal was due to increases in product sales and royalty income 
product sales were million in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year s product sales of million 
this growth in product sales was led by the m series line of instrumentation and consumable life science products million  as well as  the revenue generated from the sale of clinical diagnostic assays to physician office laboratory pol customers in the united states  which increased by  we began serving these pol customers in june when roche transferred the customers in order to comply with a court ordered preliminary injunction 
in february  the maryland federal court issued a final order of judgment against roche which does not require roche to renew existing pol contracts  some of which are scheduled to expire during fiscal should pol customer contracts not be renewed  future pol product sales would experience a decline 
royalty income was million in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year s royalty income of million 
royalties from roche represent approximately million of the total royalty income for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal these increases are attributable to higher roche sales of its elecsys and e product lines  which are based on igen s origen technology that was licensed to roche under a license agreement  as well as certain modifications made by roche to their methodology for computing royalties as a result of the litigation 
while we are not satisfied that roche is properly calculating and paying the required royalties  the recent changes in the way in which roche calculates and pays its royalties to us is expected to have a continued positive impact on our royalty income in future periods 
however  we have notified roche that their license to sell origen based products will be terminated once our right to do so is affirmed on appeal  in which case our royalty income from roche would cease 
see item  legal proceedings 
contract revenue in the current fiscal year decreased to  from million last year 
the current year fees related primarily to work completed in conjunction with the development of assays for roche 
the prior year s contract fees were primarily from non recurring amounts received in connection with our preliminary alliance with bayer diagnostics bayer 
operating costs and expenses 
product costs were million of product sales for fiscal compared to million of product sales for fiscal included in product costs for fiscal is a write off of million of tricorder detection module costs  previously recorded as fixed assets 
the tricorder modules are incorporated into customers m series systems and continue to be utilized by customers to generate ongoing reagent product sales 
the impact on prior individual annual periods was not significant 
excluding the million expense  product costs were of product sales for fiscal research and development expenses decreased million in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year excluding funding of the msd joint venture activities prior to the amendment and extension of the msd joint venture agreements in august  research and development expense was million in and million in this increase in research and development expense of million is primarily due to ongoing development costs and product enhancements associated with the m series family of products  development of new assays for the life sciences market and research and development of new systems and technologies  including hospital point of care products 
we expect research and development costs to increase as product development and core research continue to expand 
see equity in loss of affiliate below for a discussion of msd activity in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over the prior year s total of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs of million required to support the growth in sales and customers  as well as legal and other expenses of million largely associated with the amendment and extension of the msd joint venture 
costs related to our litigation with roche were offset by a settlement payment we received from roche related to the delaware litigation during the current year 
under the terms of the settlement  roche dismissed  with prejudice  all claims against us  reimbursed us for our legal fees incurred in defending this delaware litigation which totalled approximately million and granted us a fully paid up  perpetual  worldwide  non exclusive license with the right to sublicense under the patent in suit 
absent this delaware settlement  costs related to our litigation with roche increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increases are attributable to expanded activities in several areas  including pre trial motions and the preparation and conduct of the trial that ran from october through january  the increased litigation costs also included financial and legal advisory fees associated with settlement discussions with roche 
with the completion of the roche trial in january  litigation costs are expected to decline in future periods 
we have engaged a law firm in connection with the roche litigation and various other matters 
a partner of the law firm is one of our directors 
we recorded approximately million and million in legal fees with the law firm for the years ended march  and  respectively 
certain of our officers are also shareholders of several other companies  which are considered our affiliates for the purpose of this discussion 
we have shared services arrangements with these affiliated companies 
these shared services include accounting  human resources and other administrative services  as well as facility related costs and services 
shared services costs allocated to affiliated companies  other than msd  totaled million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  which reduced certain operating costs and expenses for the respective years 
amounts allocated to affiliated companies are based upon costs incurred by us and are determined through allocation methods that include time spent and square footage utilized 
amounts due from affiliated companies under the shared services arrangement was approximately  at march  interest and other expense 
interest and other expense  net of interest income  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal equity in loss of affiliate 
in august  we entered into agreements with mst continuing msd  a joint venture formed solely by igen and mst in msd was formed for the development and commercialization of products utilizing a propriety combination of mst s multi array technology together with origen and other technologies owned by us 
in conjunction with the amended agreements and the progress made by msd in the development of its products  we determined that future contributions to msd would be made based on the future investment benefit to be obtained by us 
our contributions to msd since july  were recorded as investment in affiliate and we have recorded of msd s losses since this date as equity in loss of affiliate 
msd incurred a net loss of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
see item business collaborations  and item certain relationships and related transactions 
net loss 
the net loss for fiscal year was million per common share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends compared to a net loss of million per common share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends in fiscal year the loss in the prior year comparable period included a one time  non cash charge of million per share to record the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of emerging issue task force release no 
results of operations in the future are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors  which include the volume and timing of orders for m series or other products  the timing of instrument deliveries and installations  variations in revenue recognized from royalties and other contract revenues  whether pol customers contracts are renewed  whether roche will continue to supply service and assays to pol customers  the mix of products sold  whether instruments are sold to or placed with customers  the timing of the introduction of new products  competitors introduction of new products  variations in expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the business  including legal fees  research and development costs and sales and marketing costs  equity in loss of affiliate  manufacturing capabilities  and the volume and timing of product returns and warranty claims 
the company has experienced significant operating losses each year since inception and expects those losses to continue 
losses have resulted from a combination of lower royalty revenue than the company believes it is entitled to under the license agreement with roche  costs incurred in research and development  roche litigation costs  selling costs and other general and administrative costs 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses as a result of increases in expenses for manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  research and product development  general and administrative costs and equity in loss of affiliate  offset in part by lower roche litigation costs beginning in fiscal the company s ability to become profitable in the future will depend  among other things  on its ability to expand the commercialization of existing products  introduce new products into the market  develop marketing  sales and distribution capabilities cost effectively  and complete new business arrangements 
as of march   we had net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards of approximately million which expire at various times through  including million during our ability to utilize net operating loss and general business credit tax carry forwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue service code of  as amended 
years ended march  and revenues 
total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by approximately million or to million from million in fiscal the revenue growth for fiscal was due to increases in all revenue categories product sales  royalty income and contract fees 
product sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of over the prior year s product sales of million 
this growth of million was from the m series line of instrumentation and consumable life science products million as well as new revenue generated from the sale of clinical diagnostic assays to physician office laboratory pol customers in the united states which totaled million in fiscal we began serving these pol customers in june when roche transferred the customers in order to comply with a court ordered preliminary injunction 
the growth of m series product sales was due to shipments under distribution agreements that we signed during fiscal royalty income was million in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year s royalty income of million 
royalties from roche represent approximately million of the total royalty income for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal this increase is attributable to higher roche sales of its elecsys product line  which is based on our origen technology licensed to roche under a agreement 
we are involved in litigation with roche arising out of this agreement 
one of the disputes in the litigation relates to the computation of royalties to which we believe we are entitled to under the agreement 
contract revenue in the current fiscal year increased to million from  last year 
this increase is attributable to our alliance with bayer that commenced in fiscal under which the two companies explored new products for the hospital point of care testing market 
operating costs and expenses 
product costs were million of product sales for fiscal compared to million of product sales for fiscal the decrease in product margins is attributable to m series retrofit costs of approximately  in  offset by a change in product sales mix between lower margin instrumentation of sales in fiscal versus of sales in fiscal and higher margin consumable reagents and assays of sales in fiscal versus of sales in fiscal 
research and development costs increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to personnel and development expenses of million primarily associated with enhancements and development of the m series line of products  including new assays for life science and hospital point of care  and research and development expenses associated with the msd joint venture which increased million in selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over the prior year s total of million 
this increase was due primarily to higher sales and marketing costs related to expanding the launch of the m series system throughout the united states  europe and japan 
costs associated with our litigation with roche increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to expanded activities  including work related to a court appointed special master s examination of roche s books and records  preparation and presentation of several motions  including motions for summary judgment  preparation for and participation in a trial in delaware in february   and preparation for a trial in maryland that was scheduled to commence in october the increased litigation costs also include financial and legal advisors fees associated with settlement discussions 
interest and other expense 
interest expense  net of other income  excluding a non recurring charge in  increased million in fiscal due to interest on higher debt balances during the year and a full year s amortization of the detachable warrant value associated with the convertible debentures issued in january in fiscal  we also recorded a non cash charge of million related to the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants 
the convertible debentures have a one time beneficial conversion feature measured as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of our common stock at the time of the issuance of debentures 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf release no 
 application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities and beneficial conversion features 
this standard established new guidelines for convertible securities and beneficial conversion features 
the change in methods resulted in a one time  non cash charge that was recorded during the year as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting 
the effect of the change on our statement of operations for the year ended march  was to increase the net loss by million per share 
net loss 
excluding the non recurring  non cash charge of million per share taken for the cumulative effect of accounting change  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends in fiscal including this charge  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
in fiscal  including the non cash charge  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
excluding the non cash charge of million per share taken to account for the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants issued january  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through the sale of preferred and common stock  debt financings and the placement of convertible debentures 
in addition  we have received funds from research and licensing agreements  sales of our origen line of products and royalties from product sales by licensees 
as of march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  with working capital of million 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million during the years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in and from was due primarily to higher operating losses incurred during each period  as well as increased working capital requirements 
we used approximately million  million  and million of cash for the acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements during the years ended march   and  respectively 
our contributions to msd for the year ended march  totaled million 
we believe material commitments for capital expenditures may be required in a variety of areas  such as product development programs 
we have not  at this time  made commitments for any such capital expenditure or secured additional sources to fund such commitments 
our material future obligations are as follows years ended march  and contractual obligations in thousands total thereafter notes payable      subordinated convertible debentures   msd funding commitment    operating and capital leases     interest obligations     total contractual obligations      during august  we entered into agreements with mst continuing msd  a joint venture formed solely by igen and mst in under the amended joint venture agreements  we agreed  subject to certain conditions  to fund the joint venture through november during the calendar year  we agreed to fund msd million  subject to a permitted variance of fifteen percent 
as of march   the company satisfied million of this funding commitment 
the calendar year funding commitment is based on an annual budget to be approved by a committee of our board of directors 
the funding commitment may be satisfied in part through in kind contributions of scientific and administrative personnel and shared facilities 
if the budget is not approved by our board of directors  we would be required to provide transitional funding for an additional six months  estimated at million  and under certain conditions  msd and mst have the right to terminate the joint venture and purchase our interest in msd at fair market value less certain discounts 
the msd funding commitment in the table above includes operating and capital lease commitments expected to be incurred by us as part of our funding commitment to msd 
these  amounts are excluded from the operating and capital lease commitment line in the table 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  and there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash or arrange financing sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due with respect to indebtedness when due  or in the event any of it is accelerated 
in addition  our indebtedness may require that we dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
we need substantial amounts of money to fund operations 
in this regard  from time to time we have discussions with third parties  including multinational corporations  regarding various business arrangements including distribution  marketing  research and development  joint venture and other business agreements  which could provide for substantial up front fees or payments 
further  we are considering and evaluating the advisability and feasibility of a variety of financing alternatives  which could be completed in the near term  including issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any of the foregoing arrangements and access to funds could be adversely impacted by many factors  including the results of pending litigation  the volatility of the price of our common stock  continuing losses from operations and other factors 
we believe that existing capital resources  together with revenue from product sales  royalties and contract fees will be adequate to fund operations through calendar year if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may have to scale back  or even eliminate  some programs 
alternatively  we may consider pursuing arrangements with other companies  such as granting licenses or entering into joint ventures  on terms and conditions that may not be favorable to us 
roche has the right to continue to market its elecsys products within its licensed field until our right to terminate their license is affirmed on appeal 
in connection with the litigation with roche  we have notified roche that the license agreement will terminate upon the appellate court affirming our right to do so 
termination of the license agreement would have a material adverse effect on our revenues unless  and until  we enter into a strategic partnership with another company that is able to develop and commercialize diagnostic instruments within the field presently licensed to roche 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into such a strategic partnership on favorable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by our management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those polices  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting polices include inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based on historical experience  anticipated product demand and changes in product design 
equipment and leasehold improvements our equipment and leasehold improvements are carried at cost 
depreciation on equipment and furniture is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally three to five years  using straight line or accelerated methods 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we apply judgment in determining the appropriate useful life of these assets 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from three sources product sales  royalty income and contract fees 
product sales revenue is generally recognized when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rental revenue associated with instruments that are leased is recognized ratably over the life of the lease agreements 
we make estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on the age of receivables  individual customer profiles and historical experience 
royalty income is recorded when earned based on information provided by licensees 
revenue from services performed under contracts is recognized over the term of underlying customer contract or at the end of the contract  when obligations have been satisfied 
for services performed on a time and material basis  revenue is recognized upon performance 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts or commercialization agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
capitalized software costs we record software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we apply our judgment in determining when software being developed has reached technological feasibility  and at that point we would capitalize software development costs 
through march   software development has been substantially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
equity accounting we account for our ownership in the msd joint venture on the equity method as we have determined that we do not control msd s operations 
factors considered in determining our level of control include the fact that we own less than of the voting equity interest in msd  that we do not have exclusive authority over msd decision making and have no ability to unilaterally modify the joint venture agreements  and that we have the right to appoint only one out of two seats on msd s board of managers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s long term borrowings because they bear interest at a fixed rate 
the principal terms of this debt are as follows note payable with john hancock life insurance company million principal  seven year  senior secured notes secured by future royalty revenue from roche  maturing in with quarterly interest only payments through september and quarterly principal and interest payments through march subordinated convertible debentures million principal  interest maturing january with semi annual interest payments in cash or equivalent value of common stock 
however  the company runs a risk that market rates will decline and that the interest rate will exceed those based on the then current market rate 
the company is currently not using interest rate derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
interest income earned on the company s investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates 
the company has invested its excess cash generally in securities of the us treasury  money market funds  certificates of deposit and corporate bonds 
the company invests its excess cash in accordance with a policy objective that seeks to ensure both liquidity and safety of principal 
the policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with strong investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on their terms and concentrations by type and issuer 
the company is exposed to changes in exchange rates where it sells direct in local currencies  primarily in the united kingdom and germany 
certain other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and have no exchange rate risk 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically not been material
