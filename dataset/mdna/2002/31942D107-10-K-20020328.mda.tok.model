amounts available under the credit facility are limited to of the company s earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve months 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants

the company s receivable from the partnership was  at december  the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of pawns outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s lending decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of pawn redemption by increasing or decreasing the amount pawned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate pawn balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  small advances in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tend to increase pawn redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also  larger average pawn balances can result in an increase in pawn forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawns by repaying all accrued interest on such pawns  effectively creating a new pawn transaction 
in addition to these factors  merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions affect the company s liquidity

this expansion will be funded through the company s credit facility 
while the company continually looks for  and is presented with  potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire or open a new store in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
between january  and march   the company opened four new check cashing short term advance locations and three pawnshops in mexico
