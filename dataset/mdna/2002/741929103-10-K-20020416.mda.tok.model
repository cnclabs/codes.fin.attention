in  the company focused on debt restructuring  cost containment and ebitda growth 
these efforts resulted in the following debt was reduced to million at december  from billion in  with an after tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of million for the year  selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced million from the previous year  ebitda increased to million for  a million increase over the prior year  and million in interest expense was saved over the prior year from the principal reduction of senior notes and convertible debentures 
prices in the long distance industry in the united states and the united kingdom have declined in recent years  and as competition continues to increase  the company believes that prices are likely to continue to decrease 
additionally  primus believes that because deregulatory influences have begun to affect telecommunications markets outside the united states and the united kingdom  including australia  the deregulatory trend will result in greater competition which could adversely affect primus s net revenue per minute and gross margin as a percentage of net revenue 
however  the company believes that such decreases in prices will be offset by increased communications usage and decreased costs 
through the first part of  the company experienced these declines in per minute net revenue and gross margin but has witnessed price stabilization in the latter part of the year 
as the portion of traffic transmitted over leased or owned facilities increases  cost of revenue increasingly will be comprised of fixed costs 
in order to manage such costs  primus pursues a flexible approach with respect to the expansion of its network 
in most instances  primus initially obtains transmission capacity on a variable cost  per minute leased basis  then acquires additional capacity on a fixed cost basis when traffic volume makes such a commitment cost effective  and ultimately purchases and operates its own facilities when traffic levels justify such investment 
the company also seeks to lower the cost of revenue through optimizing the routing of calls over the least cost route  increasing volumes on the fixed cost leased and owned lines  thereby spreading the allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of minutes  negotiating lower variable usage based costs with domestic and foreign service providers and negotiating additional and lower cost foreign carrier agreements with the foreign incumbent carriers and others  and continuing to expand the network when traffic volumes justify such investment 
the company generally realizes a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on its international long distance as compared to its domestic long distance services and a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on its services to both business and residential customers compared to those realized on its services to other telecommunications carriers 
in addition  primus generally realizes a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on long distance services as compared to those realized on local switched and cellular services 
carrier services  which generate a lower gross margin as a percentage of net revenue than retail business and residential services  are an important part of net revenue because the additional traffic volume of such carrier customers improves the utilization of the network and allows the company to obtain greater volume discounts from its suppliers than it otherwise would realize 
primus s overall gross margin as a percentage of net revenue may fluctuate based on the relative volumes of international versus domestic long distance services  carrier services versus business and residential long distance services and the proportion of traffic carried on primus s network versus resale of other carriers services 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  occupancy costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising and administrative costs 
all selling  general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred  with the exception of direct response advertising  which is expensed in accordance with statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
through various cost cutting programs  primus has realized significant savings in sales and marketing expenses  salaries and benefits  occupancy costs and other administrative expenses 
foreign currency a significant portion of the company s net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for the company s consolidated financial statements is the united states dollar 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each respective entity 
in the future  primus expects to continue to derive the majority of net revenue and incur a significant portion of its operating costs from outside the united states  and therefore changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on primus s results of operations 
primus historically has not engaged in hedging transactions and does not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
critical accounting policies to aid in the understanding of the company s financial reporting  the company s most critical accounting policies are described below 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on the company s financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call and is recorded upon completion of a call  adjusted for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
revenue for a period is calculated from information received through the company s network switches 
customized software has been designed to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates 
this software provides the company the ability to do a more timely and accurate analysis of revenue earned in a period 
net revenue is also earned for the provision of data internet services 
the company generally prices its services at a savings compared to the major carriers operating in primus s principal service regions 
net revenue is derived from carrying a mix of business  residential and carrier long distance traffic  data and internet traffic  and also from the provision of local and cellular services 
primus expects to continue to generate net revenue from internal growth through sales and marketing efforts focused on customers with significant international long distance usage  including smes  multinational corporations  ethnic residential customers and other telecommunications carriers and resellers 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
due to the large number of customers that the company serves  it is impractical to review the credit worthiness of each of its customers  although a credit review is performed for larger carrier and retail business customers 
the company considers a number of factors in determining the proper level of the allowance including historical collection experience  current economic trends  the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio and changes in the credit worthiness of the company s customers 
systems to detect fraudulent call activity are in place within the network of the company  but if these systems fail to identify such activity  the company may realize a higher degree of uncollectible accounts 
cost of revenue cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs incurred from other domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers to originate  transport and terminate calls 
the majority of primus s cost of revenue is variable  based upon the number of minutes of use  with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense 
call activity is tracked and analyzed with customized software that analyzes the traffic flowing through the company s network switches and calculates the variable cost of revenue with predetermined contractual rates 
if the domestic or foreign telecommunications carriers have tracked and invoiced the volume of minutes at levels different than what primus s activity shows or have invoiced at different rates  the company will dispute the charges invoiced 
there is no guarantee that the company will prevail in the dispute but realizes a greater success with disputes concerning contracted rates 
primus uses significant estimates to determine the level of success in dispute resolution and considers past historical experience  basis of dispute  financial status and current relationship with vendor  and aging of prior disputes 
valuation of long lived assets the company reviews intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  the company compares the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the company is required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
the company makes significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of the long lived assets

this adjustment resulted in an asset impairment write down of million or per share  consisting of the following specific asset write downs million in goodwill  million in property and equipment and million in customer lists 
the estimated fair value of the company s assets was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved

short and long term liquidity considerations and risks the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  million as of december   accounts receivable financing  and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund the company s debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and other cash needs for its operations at least though year end nonetheless  the company will continue to have significant debt and debt service obligations  given such obligations as of december  as of december   the company has million of indebtedness with payments of principal and interest due as follows includes effect of senior note purchase made in january  and settlement of equipment lease obligations with cisco in march amounts in thousands year ending december  equipment financing senior notes other long term obligations convertible subordinated debentures total thereafter     minimum principal interest payments     less amount representing interest     the company maintains a dialogue with certain holders of its debt securities regarding the consensual restructuring of those obligations and is currently attempting to renegotiate some of its equipment financing arrangements  which includes capital leases and vendor financing obligations with various vendors 
the company is also seeking to raise additional financing 
the company believes that any new investors  in addition to customary terms and conditions  are very likely to have their investment contingent on an overall reduction of debt through consensual restructuring  debt buy back  debt swap  or any combination thereof 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful in these efforts 
if the company is successful in either restructuring its indebtedness or in raising additional financing  it is likely that securities comprising a significant percentage of the company s fully diluted capital will be issued in connection with the completion of such transactions 
in addition  unless the company is able to reduce significantly its outstanding debt and or raise sufficient additional financing  and or significantly improve its cash flow from operations  the company may not be able to service its debt or other obligations and could be required to seek relief from such obligations under the bankruptcy laws of the united states or other similar laws in other countries 
additionally  if the company s plans or assumptions change  including those with respect to the development of the network and the level of the company s operations and operating cash flow  if its assumptions prove inaccurate  if it consummates additional investments or acquisitions  if it experiences unexpected costs or competitive pressures  or if existing cash and any other borrowings prove to be insufficient  the company may need to obtain such restructuring  financing and or relief sooner than expected 
in light of the foregoing  the company and or its subsidiaries will evaluate on a continuing basis  depending on market conditions and the outcome of events described under special note regarding forward looking statements  the most efficient use of the company s capital  including purchasing  refinancing or otherwise retiring certain of the company s outstanding debt  debt exchanges  restructuring of obligations  financings  capital expenditure investments in the company s network  systems and lines of business  and issuances of securities in the open market or by other means to the extent permitted by its existing covenant restrictions

substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
the company currently has substantial indebtedness and anticipates that it and its subsidiaries will incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of the company s indebtedness i could make it more difficult for it to make payments of interest on its outstanding debt  ii could limit the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  iii requires that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  will not be available for use in its business  iv could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business  v results in the company being more highly leveraged than some of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and vi will make it more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
potential nasdaq delisting 
on february   the company received a notice of delisting from nasdaq 
if the minimum bid price per share of its common stock is not or greater for a period of ten consecutive trading days before may  or such shorter period as nasdaq may notify us of  the company s common stock is likely to be delisted from nasdaq national market  subject to its right to appeal any such determination 
if this occurs  the common stock could be listed for trading on the nasdaq smallcap market for a period of approximately days  and thereafter the common stock could be further delisted such that trading would only occur on the otc bulletin board 
the smallcap market and the otc bulletin board are substantially less liquid markets than the nasdaq national market 
as a result  if the company s common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  our stockholders may have greater difficulty disposing of their shares in acceptable amounts and at acceptable prices  and the company may have greater difficulty issuing equity securities or securities convertible into common stock in such circumstances 
if delisted  the company cannot assure you when  if ever  its common stock would once again be eligible for listing on the nasdaq national market 
limited operating history  entry into internet and data business  entry into developing markets 
the company was incorporated in february  and began generating revenue in march the company only recently has been targeting businesses and residential customers for internet and data services through the primus brand  its subsidiary iprimus 
com and other acquired isps 
the company has been expanding and intends to continue to expand its offering of data and internet services worldwide 
the company anticipates offering a full range of internet protocol based data and voice communications over the global broadband atm ip network which the company has deployed 
the company has limited experience in the internet and web hosting business and cannot provide assurance that it will successfully establish or expand the business 
currently  the company provides internet services to business and residential customers in the united states  australia  canada  japan  india  brazil  germany  france and spain  and offers internet transmission services in the indian ocean southeast asia regions through its satellite earth station in london and its earth stations in india 
accordingly  the company cannot provide assurance that its future operations will generate operating or net income or positive cash flow  and the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  problems and delays inherent in establishing a new business in a rapidly changing industry 
the market for internet connectivity and related services is extremely competitive 
the company s primary competitors include incumbent operators and other isps that have a significant national or international presence 
many of these carriers have substantially greater resources  capital and operational experience than the company does

in addition  the company will require substantial additional capital to make investments in its internet operations  and it may not be able to obtain that capital on favorable terms or at all 
the amount of such capital expenditures may exceed the amount of capital expenditures spent on the voice portion of its business going forward 
further  even if the company is able to establish and expand its internet business  the company will face numerous risks that may adversely affect the operations of its internet business 
these risks include competition in the market for internet services  the company s limited operating history as an isp  the company s reliance on third parties to provide maintenance and support services for the company s atm ip network  the company s reliance on third party proprietary technology to provide certain services to the company s customers  including  among others  software applications  web hosting services and voip services  the company s ability to recruit and retain qualified technical  engineering and other personnel  the company s ability to adapt and react to rapid changes in technology related to the internet business  uncertainty relating to the continuation of the adoption of the internet as a medium of commerce and communications  vulnerability to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other disruptive problems due to the accidental or intentional actions of others  adverse regulatory developments  the potential liability for information disseminated over the company s network  and the company s need to manage the growth of its internet business  including the need to enter into agreements with other providers of infrastructure capacity and equipment and to acquire other isps and internet related businesses on acceptable terms

in order to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize additional transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage its employees  all within a rapidly changing regulatory environment 
inaccuracies in the company s forecast of traffic could result in insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses

there may be difficulty in integrating the service offerings  distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with the company s own 
successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel which may distract their attention from the day to day business  the development or acquisition of new technologies  and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities  and there can be no assurance that successful integration will occur in light of such events 
intense competition in long distance telecommunications 
the long distance telecommunications and data industry is intensely competitive and is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger industry participants 
competition in all of the company s markets is likely to stay intense  or even increase in intensity and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is likely to become similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and larger networks than the company  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  as well as long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
in addition  many of the company s competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related costs which could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
many companies emerging out of bankruptcy could also end up enjoying a lower cost structure and put pricing pressure within the industry 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business and effectuate its liquidity objectives is dependent upon whether the company continues to maintain favorable relationships and credit terms with the transmission facilities based carriers to carry the company s traffic 
international operations 
the company has significant international operations 
in many international markets  the existing carrier will control access to the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  and have significant operational economies  including a larger backbone network and correspondent agreements

industry changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  technological improvements  expansion of infrastructure and the globalization of the world s economies 
in order to compete effectively  the company must adjust its contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes and its ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
network development  migration of traffic 
the long term success of the company is dependent upon its ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain the network

dependence on key personnel
