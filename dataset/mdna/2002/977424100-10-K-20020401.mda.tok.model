these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
investors should carefully review the information contained in this report under the caption factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock beginning on page overview we are a leading global provider of customer interaction recording  performance analysis and electronic learning management software that enables companies to optimize their customer relationships 
by using our browser based architecture to capture samples of customer interactions taking place in the contact center  and then sharing them with other departments via e mail and web links  organizations can enhance the quality of customer interactions across multiple communications media including the telephone  e mail and the internet 
as a fully integrated  closed loop performance optimization solution  our software enables companies to record  evaluate  analyze and learn from customer contacts  allowing them to generate additional revenue opportunities  improve profitability  develop customer sales service representatives skill sets  enhance customer retention and achieve greater customer loyalty 
our software is designed to integrate with a variety of third party software applications  such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning applications  and with existing telephony and computer network hardware and software 
the majority of our customers are companies with one or more contact centers that handle voice and data customer interactions for outbound sales and marketing operations  inbound service support lines  or both 
we primarily utilize a direct sales organization  select resellers and a variety of strategic marketing alliances to reach our target customer base 
during the first half of  we observed a number of factors indicating a slowdown in corporate spending for information technology and in the general economy 
at the beginning of the year  our sales cycle lengthened as our prospects and customers confidence in the economy deteriorated 
during the second half of  while some of our prospects and customers renewed their commitments to us  others continued to reevaluate or delay their capital plans due to their own budget uncertainties 
we cannot predict how long any economy related trends will continue or the extent to which this economic uncertainty will continue to impact our prospects and customers 
a deterioration in the economy  a reduction in the level of corporate spending for information technology or other matters may cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy we derive our revenue from licensing our software and providing related services 
revenue is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on their relative fair values  which is established by the price charged when the respective element is sold separately 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
services include installation  training  business consulting services and maintenance 
revenue from installation  training and business consulting services are recognized upon performance of the related services 

table of contents these services are traditionally offered and billed as separate elements of contracts on either a time and material basis or a fixed service fee plus out of pocket expense reimbursement basis 
the functionality of the software is not dependent on these services 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and includes the right to unspecified upgrades on an if and when available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract  usually one year 
specified upgrades are not typically offered to customers 
historically  all customers have purchased an initial maintenance contract for each newly licensed site 
during  and  of our customers renewed their annual maintenance contracts 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of revenue was derived from sales within north america  including the us and canada 
we expect that a greater proportion of future license and professional services revenue will be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee for one or more software products for a specified number of users 
the amount of the license fee varies based on which software product is licensed  the number of software products licensed  the number of installation sites and the number of users licensed 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to allow additional users to use previously licensed software products or to license additional software products 
each software product contains common components  allowing for easy integration of additional software products as they are licensed from us 
customers that license our software products usually receive the software on compact disc 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of license revenue primarily consists of royalties due to third parties and packaging costs 
cost of services revenue includes personnel costs and related expenses for installation  training  business consulting and maintenance personnel and allocations of facilities  communications and depreciation expense 
personnel costs include salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and travel expenses 
we classify all charges to the operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for facilities  communications and depreciation to each of the functional areas based on use 
these allocated charges include rent for corporate offices  communication charges and depreciation and amortization expenses for office furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional expenses  public relations  and tradeshows  as well as allocations of facilities  communications and depreciation expense 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development  as well as allocations of facilities  communications and depreciation expense 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
to date  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel costs for accounting  information technology  human resources  legal and facilities  as well as professional service fees  provisions for bad debt expense and allocations of facilities  communications and depreciation expense 
we had full time employees at december   up from at december  and at december  we anticipate that operating expenses will increase as we increase sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund ongoing research and development  broaden professional services offerings  improve operational and financial systems and support our growth internationally 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  property and equipment  intangible assets  research and development and software development costs and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include  but are not limited to  lower than anticipated growth from existing customers  an inability to attract new customers and grow internationally  an inability to grow through acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions  technology changes  or a decline in the financial stability of our customers 
negative developments in these or other risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a small provision for estimated sales allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales allowances  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future credits  revenues could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
allowance for deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing income in the period in which such determination was made 
research and development and software development costs 
we evaluate the establishment of technological feasibility of our products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we sell products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs  accordingly  we have concluded that technological feasibility is not established until the completion of a working model 
to date  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material 
therefore  we have charged all such costs to research and development in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles 
we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and intangibles by comparing the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  we use the fair value in determining the amount of impairment loss that should be recorded 
the determination of undiscounted net operating cash flows requires management to make estimates

we receive follow on revenue from our customers when they purchase additional user licenses at existing sites and when they license our products at new sites 
services revenue increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the growth in installation and training revenue was closely tied to the growth in software license revenue 
maintenance revenue increased due to new customer sites and renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites 
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased due to the compounding effect of maintenance revenue from both new customer sites and renewals of maintenance contracts from existing customer sites  and  to a lesser extent  the addition of business consulting services which began during the latter half of 
table of contents we discontinued the sale of hardware during the first quarter of cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing gross profit margins of  and  respectively 
the increased gross profit margins in were driven by improved services margins that resulted primarily from the increase in maintenance services revenue 
gross profit margins increased slightly in due to the discontinuance of hardware sales in the first quarter of cost of license revenue increased in to  and in to  from  in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increases in absolute dollars were due to increased royalties for third party software resulting from increased license revenue 
during and  we released new products and enhanced some of our existing products  both of which contained additional third party software components 
we expect cost of license revenue in absolute dollars  and as a percentage of license revenue  to increase as a greater proportion of revenue is originated from products containing third party software components 
cost of services revenue increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing  and of services revenue  respectively 
the increases in absolute dollars were a result of increases in the number of employees engaged in installation  training and customer maintenance services 
the improvement in the services margins in and was due to greater efficiencies in our customer support center 
we expect to continue growing our customer services organization and the related costs as our customer base expands  and we anticipate that cost of services revenue in absolute dollars will continue to increase 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel costs  marketing programs  facilities expenses and the establishment of additional sales offices in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to an increase in sales personnel  advertising  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in marketing program expenses 
we expect that the absolute dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase due to the planned growth of our sales force  including the expansion of the north american sales force and the establishment of additional sales offices internationally in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we also expect additional increases in advertising  marketing programs and other promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and consultants engaged in research and development activities  as well as increased costs related to our additional test lab facilities 
the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and consultants engaged in research and development activities 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to commit substantial resources to enhance existing product functionality and to developing new products 
furthermore  we may incur additional research and development charges associated with software based technology acquisitions for further information see liquidity and capital resources 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in to million and in to million from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the increased provision for bad debt expense  increased corporate expenses in the executive  finance and administrative functions to support a larger organization  and increased facilities expense due to the larger headquarters facility 
the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees 
table of contents and related expenses in the executive  finance and administrative functions to manage the growth of our company 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add infrastructure to support a growing organization and continue to invest in our international expansion 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to relocate our corporate headquarters to a larger facility within the atlanta metropolitan area 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force s abstract no 
 we estimated that the net costs associated with our then existing facilities  which are under non cancellable leases expiring on june   would be approximately  we recorded this obligation during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  one of the sublessees was unable to fulfill its obligations and the sublease was terminated 
as a result  we recorded an additional obligation of  in the second quarter of to cover the additional estimated loss 
as of december   the accrual balance was  in order to secure the new corporate headquarters facility and furniture leases  we entered into irrevocable standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million in and during the second quarter of  we replaced our pledged short term investments  serving as collateral on the letters of credit  with cash and cash equivalents and  accordingly  reclassified them as restricted cash on the december  balance sheet 
the letters of credit and related restricted funds have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in and  which correspond with their classification on the accompanying balance sheets 
during  we incurred a deferred stock compensation charge of million for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock option grants 
this charge is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
deferred stock compensation was   and  in  and  respectively  and has been classified into the respective department functional areas 
in addition  we incurred other personnel costs of  during  which related to severance payments for terminated executives  as well as bonus and relocation costs in connection with recruiting a new executive 
such costs were allocated whereby  was classified as research and development and  as general and administrative 
acquired in process research and development 
in and  we purchased software based research and development from third parties totaling million and million  respectively 
we recorded an expense for these purchases when we acquired the assets and we classified the expense as acquired in process research and development ipr d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the ipr d purchase in related to the development of technology to store and retrieve substantially larger volumes of data than our software was previously capable of storing and retrieving 
we purchased this technology in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at per share 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
at the time of the purchase  we estimated that it would take up to a year to complete the development of this technology and that it would cost an additional million to complete these efforts 
this project was successfully completed in the third quarter of during  we entered into an option agreement to purchase ipr d technologies relating to the development of electronic media data capture and optimization 
as of december   the option s carrying value was  and was classified in intangible and other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in march  we paid million to exercise this option to purchase the underlying technology 
also  during the first quarter of  we purchased additional ipr d for million relating to similar development issues 
at the time of the purchases  we estimated that it would take up to a year to complete these development projects and we estimated that we would incur at least an additional million to complete these projects 
these projects were successfully completed by the end of 
table of contents in june  we purchased software based ipr d technology relating to the development of on line analytical processing and multi dimensional analysis capabilities for million 
at that time  we estimated that it would take up to a year for us to complete the development of this technology and that it would cost at least an additional million 
we currently expect this project to be completed during at the date of the aforementioned transactions  the acquired ipr d technologies had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
at the time of each transaction  we estimated the stage of completion of the project and the time and resources required to complete the project by creating a product design plan and evaluating the progress of the acquired technology towards this plan 
a significant amount of uncertainty existed as to our ability to complete the development projects within a timeframe acceptable to the market  and failure to do so could cause our competitive position in the market to erode 
additionally  the amount of development required to enable the acquired technology to integrate with our primary product was estimated to be significant  which increased the uncertainty surrounding its successful development 
the acquired technologies did not have alternative future uses 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net decreased in to million due primarily to lower yields and a lower investment balance which was only partially offset by the full year of interest earned in compared to less than eleven months in as a result of the initial public offering ipo proceeds received in february interest income expense  net increased to million in from  in due to the investment of the proceeds from our ipo 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for state income tax  federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in prior to  no provision for federal  state or foreign income taxes was recorded  primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are normally recognized for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance in full for deferred tax asset generated as the future realization of their tax benefit is not currently considered more likely than not 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of total revenue represented by each item 
the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider to be necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

we expect that services revenue will continue to grow relative to license revenue throughout gross profit margins increased from quarter to quarter during and we expect the gross profit margins for to be comparable to operating expenses  excluding the acquired ipr d  remained relatively constant during primarily due to our redeployment of resources in light of the uncertainty that developed in the economy in during  operating expenses increased each quarter primarily as a result of the increase in the number of employees engaged in all areas of our business 
we believe that our quarterly operating results may experience seasonal fluctuations in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on customer calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources during  net cash used for operating activities was million  including million used to purchase ipr d 
net cash used in investing activities was million and net cash provided by financing activities was million 
our december  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million since the prior year primarily due to the funding of the operating loss and capital expenditures 

table of contents in february  we completed our ipo in which we issued million shares at an offering price of per share 
simultaneously  our underwriters exercised their over allotment option to issue an additional  shares   shares of which were sold by us 
net proceeds to us were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and selling stockholders net proceeds 
since the ipo  we repaid all of our long term debt totaling of million  including  in prepayment penalties 
we recorded an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  during due to the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees and the payment of the prepayment penalty 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments and million of working capital 
we had no debt outstanding at december  we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million as of december  to secure the corporate headquarters facility and furniture leases 
during  we replaced our pledged short term investments  serving as collateral on the letters of credit  with cash and cash equivalents and  accordingly  reclassified them as restricted cash on the december  accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the letters of credit and related restricted funds have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in and  which correspond with their classification on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands december  thereafter as of december   we did not have any other contractual commitments or off balance sheet arrangements 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term instruments  we do not have material market risk exposure 
during  we experienced a significant decline in interest income as a result of declining investment yields originating from the economic slowdown during the year 
we expect that interest income in will be significantly less than in due to lower interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
to minimize this risk  our investment policy guidelines specify that we invest in the highest investment grade securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of nine months 
our investment portfolio may contain securities with maturities of up to three years 
we feel that this minimizes our market risk exposure 
the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in australia  canada  japan  mexico and the united kingdom and conduct transactions in either the local currency of the location or in us dollars 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
we expect to have total capital expenditures of approximately million in we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase over the next several years as we expand our facilities and acquire equipment to support the expansion of our research and development activities and internal management information systems 

table of contents we expect to continue to experience growth in our operating expenses 
we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we intend to use our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments primarily to fund our sales and marketing and research and development expenses  and other working capital needs and for general corporate purposes  including the development of our product lines through acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by any cash used in operating activities  will be more than sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new financing arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure that any financing arrangements will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased to days for the fourth quarter of from days for the fourth quarter of  primarily due to a greater proportion of our revenue originating from international operations  where payment is typically slower than in the united states and due to the general decline in the overall economy 
we expect our days sales outstanding to increase as we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from international operations 
during the first half of  we observed a number of factors indicating a slowdown in corporate spending for information technology and in the general economy 
at the beginning of the year  our sales cycle lengthened as our prospects and customers confidence in the economy deteriorated 
during the second half of  while some of our prospects and customers renewed their commitments to us  others continued to reevaluate or delay their capital plans due to their own budget uncertainties 
we cannot predict how long any economy related trends will continue or the extent to which this economic uncertainty will continue to impact our prospects and customers 
a deterioration in the economy  a reduction in the level of corporate spending for information technology or other matters may cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
transactions with management during the first quarter of  notes receivable due from certain officers totaling  were satisfied by selling  at current fair market value  mature shares of our common stock to us  which were retired immediately 
notes receivable from our cfo were refinanced with a full recourse note for approximately million with floating monthly interest of basic points plus the federal funds rate 
the note is payable in three payments of principal and interest due annually through february recent accounting pronouncements in november  the staff of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an announcement on the topic of income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
this announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the income statement 
this announcement should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
historically  we have recorded reimbursements as a reduction of services cost of revenue and as a result of this pronouncement  we will include these amounts in revenue 
the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact our results of operations or financial position 
however  the adoption of this pronouncement will reduce gross profit margins and other measures of profitability to revenues

this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted  and goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
most other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and intangibles assets acquired after june  will be subject to the new rules 
the adoption of this sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and our other public filings 
important factors currently known to our management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the disclosures contained in this report as well as the following risks our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
in particular  we derive a significant portion of our software license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from one of these orders may cause our results of operations during a quarter to be lower than we expect 
the delay or failure to close anticipated sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenue in that quarter and subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale could be recognized 
in addition  because our revenue from implementation  maintenance and training services largely correlates with our license revenue  a decline in license revenue could also cause a decline in our services revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
our revenue  expenses and operating results may vary significantly in response to the risk factors described in this section  as well as the following factors  some of which are beyond our control a decrease in demand for our software or  more generally  for products that record and analyze the interactions between a business and its customers and or provide electronic learning  announcements or introductions of new products and services by our competitors  product pricing decisions by our competitors  the timely payment of fees due to us by our customers  our ability to develop  market and manage new software  software enhancements and services  the deferral of orders for our software or delays in the implementation of our software from one quarter to a later quarter  how quickly we are able to develop new software  software enhancements and services that our customers require  how much money we have to spend to improve our software  services and operations  
table of contents delays in installments of our software  the lengthiness and unpredictability of sales cycles for our software  the mix of revenue generated by software licenses and related services  spending limitations imposed on our customers or potential customers because of economic factors and decreased capital spending budgets  including limitations imposed after the sales cycle has begun but before a deal is consummated  the timing and size of our capital expenditures and changes in our working capital  the failure of our customers to renew their annual maintenance  either because they consolidate their contact centers or they stop using our product company wide  general economic factors and changes in technology that could cause our existing and potential customers to decrease what they spend on customer relationship management software  the economic conditions of the companies within the financial services and telecommunications industry verticals into which we have historically sold and expect to sell our software  how successfully our reseller partners are able to resell our software  and how successful we are in selling our products in new geographic markets 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price 
historically  our revenue growth has fluctuated from as low as a decline to as high as a growth from one quarter to the next 
if our future revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations we may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies which complement our software and services 
because of the increasing use of new customer interaction mediums such as the internet and e mail  we believe that it may be important for us to acquire complementary technology to quickly bring new products to market 
we have very limited experience in making acquisitions and investments 
as a result  our ability to identify prospects  conduct acquisitions and to properly manage the integration of acquisitions is unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  it may seriously harm our business and operating results 
in making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments  we face a number of risks  including the difficulty of identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates  performing appropriate due diligence  identifying potential liabilities and negotiating acceptable terms for acquisitions and investments  the potential distraction of our management  diversion of our resources and disruption of our business  our retention and motivation of key employees of the acquired companies  our entry into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior experience  competition for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger than us or have greater financial and other resources than we have  our inability to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or investment  our inability to maintain good relations with the customers and suppliers of the acquired company  and our inability to effectively integrate acquisition or investments into the company and achieve expected synergies 
in addition  if we make or finance acquisitions using convertible debt or equity securities with terms different from our common stock  our existing stockholders may be diluted  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

table of contents our software has a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results although it typically takes three to twelve months from the time we qualify a sales lead until we sign a contract with the customer  we occasionally experience a longer sales cycle 
it is therefore difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will occur 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large orders or a significant number of small orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenue and the timing of our corresponding expenditures 
this could harm our ability to meet our financial forecasts for a given quarter 
our customers decisions regarding their purchase of our software and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our software  our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our software  competition for a shrinking amount of corporate resources because of a slowing economy  the investment of money and other resources required by customers to purchase and implement our software  customers budget cycles and operating activities  which affect the timing of their purchases  the competitive evaluation and internal approval process many of our customers undertake before purchasing our software and services  delayed purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new software or software enhancements by us or our competitors  and the length of time some of our larger customers require to make a decision to purchase our software and services 
although we have recently achieved a quarterly operating profit  we may experience quarterly losses from operations in the future we have only recently achieved a quarterly operating profit 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception and we may continue to suffer losses in the future 
as a result of our accumulated operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in addition  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  professional services  and sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to sustain profitability in any future period 
if we do not continue to achieve profitability from operations  or if we do not remain profitable on a net basis  we may need to obtain additional financing 
the financing from other sources upon which we have historically relied may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
if we fail to remain profitable  it will materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock 
we rely heavily on sales of our equality balance and equality evaluation software our financial performance has depended  and will continue to depend  on our ability to develop and maintain market acceptance of our equality balance software and new and enhanced versions of it 
historically  nearly all of our license revenue has been derived from the sale of our equality balance and equality evaluation software  and we expect revenue from these two products to continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
through december   we have recognized less than of our revenue from products other than equality balance and equality evaluation 
as a result  factors which adversely affect the pricing or demand for our equality balance and equality evaluation software  such as competitive pressures  technological change or evolution in customer preferences  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these factors are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
if we fail to expand and manage our international operations  we may be unable to reach or maintain our desired levels of revenue or profitability revenue from customers located outside of north america accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for years ended december  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations through internal business expansion and strategic business relationships 
our 
table of contents operations outside of north america at december  consisted of dedicated employees located in australia  canada  germany  japan  mexico  the netherlands and the united kingdom 
most of our international revenue through december  has come from international branches of our customers based in north america 
we have established relationships with a small number of international resellers but  through december   we have not recognized a material amount of revenue from these relationships 
in addition to general risks associated with international expansion  such as foreign currency fluctuations and political and economic instability  our plans to expand internationally may be adversely affected by a number of risks  including limited development of an international market for our software and services  the challenges we face in expanding and training our international sales force and support operations  expenses associated with customizing products for multiple countries  longer payment cycles  different accounting procedures and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  and multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations governing intellectual property  call monitoring and the recording of employees 
as we further expand our operations outside the united states  we will face new competitors and competitive environments 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic competitors  foreign competitors may pose an even greater risk  as they may possess a better understanding of their local markets and better working relationships with local infrastructure providers and others 
in particular  because telephone protocols and standards are unique to each country  local competitors will have more experience with  and may have a competitive advantage in  these markets 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of local knowledge or similar relationships in foreign markets  which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage 
conducting business internationally poses risks that could affect our financial results even if we are successful in expanding our operations internationally  conducting business outside north america poses many risks that could adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  we may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us 
moreover  exchange rate risks can have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
where we sell our products in us dollars  our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the dollar  thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies 
where we sell our products in local currencies  we could be competitively unable to change our prices to reflect fluctuations in the exchange rate 
in recent periods  for example  our revenues in europe have been adversely affected by the decline in the value of the euro and its component currencies relative to the us dollar 
additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include the following longer payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
we face intense competition that could adversely affect our revenue  profitability and market share the market for products that record customer interactions  analyze performance and or provide electronic learning is intensely competitive  evolving and experiences rapid changes in technology 
we believe our principal competitors include  but are not limited to quality monitoring suppliers to the contact center industry  traditional call logging vendors  electronic learning vendors  analytics vendors  systems integrators and consulting firms  and 
table of contents new  larger and more established entities that may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of recording or performance enhancing software solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  more established business relationships  larger customer bases  a broader range of products and services  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel  management  service  support and other resources than we do 
this could allow our current and potential competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take better advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
these competitors may distinguish themselves from us on the basis of their longer operating histories and ability to withstand difficult economic conditions 
our competitors may also be able to offer products at lower prices or with other incentives that we cannot match 
additionally  the scope of our products and services may be viewed as too narrow because some of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services 
in addition  many of our competitors market their products through resellers and companies that integrate their technology and products with those of the competitor 
these resellers and technology partners of our competitors often have strong business relationships with our customers and potential customers 
for example  some of our competitors have a better and more long standing relationship with telephone switch vendors 
our competitors may use these business relationships to market and sell their products and compete for customers with us 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not offer or develop products and services that are superior to ours 
in addition  it is possible that resellers or technology partners  such as certain telephone switch vendors  may acquire one or more of our competitors  which would further solidify their business relationships 
in addition  we have developed  and intend to continue to develop  relationships with companies that resell our software and companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads  some of which may become competitors 
revenue from our resellers accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect revenue from our resellers  and accordingly our dependence on resellers  to increase as we establish more relationships with companies to resell our software worldwide 
we engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with our resellers  and rely on them for recommendations of our software during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
when we enter into agreements with these companies  the agreements are not exclusive and may ordinarily be terminated by either party 
some of these companies have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
in addition  through their relationships with us  these companies could learn about our software and the market for our software and services and could develop and sell competing products and services 
as a result  our relationships with these companies could lead to increased competition for us 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our market and as new products  services and technologies are introduced 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of our market share 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to develop new software or improve our existing software to meet or adapt to the changing needs and standards of our target market  sales of our software and services may decline our future success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce new software and software enhancements which meet the needs of companies seeking to record and analyze their interactions with customers and or deliver electronic learning to their employees 
to achieve increased market acceptance of our software and services  we must  among other things  continue to improve our existing software and introduce new software solutions  incorporate new technology into our software and services on a timely and cost effective basis  keep pace with the products and services of our competitors  satisfy the changing requirements of our current and potential customers  
table of contents improve the effectiveness of our software  particularly in implementations involving very large databases and large numbers of simultaneous users  enhance our software s ease of administration  improve our software s ability to extract data from existing software systems  and adapt to rapidly changing computer operating system  database and software platform standards and internet technology 
in addition  industry standards may not be established  or we may not be able to conform to new standards in a timely fashion to remain competitive 
our failure to conform to prevailing technology standards in our industry could limit our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 
we may require substantial product development expenditures and lead time to keep pace and ensure compatibility with new technology in our industry 
if we fail to develop and introduce new software and enhancements for our existing software  our software and services may not achieve market acceptance and we may be unable to attract new customers 
we may also lose existing customers  to whom we seek to sell additional software and services 
during the years ended december  and  we introduced five new equality product modules equality discover  interactive  response  connect  and now 
these new modules generated less than of our total license revenue during the years ended december  and the success of these modules is dependent upon contact centers  adoption of new technologies that will enable them to interact with their customers via e mail and collaborative web chat sessions and the adoption of electronic learning applications in the customer contact center 
we cannot predict how quickly  if ever  contact centers will adopt this new technology 
if this does not happen  it could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we encounter problems with the release of the new version of our equality balance product or if the product does not achieve market acceptance  it may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability we released for general availability version six of our equality balance product in july as with any new version of a product there are significant factors that may adversely affect anticipated future revenues  including unexpected delays in the introduction and implementation of the product  unexpected problems or defects with the product  changes required to the integrations connections between our product and the surrounding operating environment  and market acceptance of the product 
because of these and additional risks  both known and unknown  we cannot be certain that future revenues generated by this product will meet expectations 
failure of these revenues to develop could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products may fail to perform properly  which may cause us to incur additional expenses or lose sales our software is used in a complex operating environment that requires its integration with computer and telephone networks and other business software applications 
furthermore  the hardware  software and network systems generally used in conjunction with our software  particularly telephone standards and protocols  change rapidly 
the evolution of these standards may cause our products to function slowly or improperly 
poor product performance may necessitate redevelopment of our product or other costly reengineering measures which may divert our management and product development resources and funds 
due to the large number of  and variations in  computer and telephone network systems and applications  as well as the rapid changes in these products  our testing process may be unable to duplicate all possible environments in which our software is expected to perform 
any errors or defects that are discovered after we release new or enhanced software could cause us to lose revenue  cause a delay in the market acceptance of our software  damage our customer relationships and reputation and increase our service and warranty costs 
all of these problems could be exacerbated as we move our product to the latest software technologies and platforms 

table of contents our failure to protect our intellectual property may lead to third parties using our technology for their own benefit and our failure to access third party technology could delay the development or sale of our software our success depends to a significant degree upon the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights  and we cannot be certain that third parties will not misappropriate our technology and use it for their own benefit 
also  most of these protections do not preclude our competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our software 
any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of march   we have four us registered trademarks  one patent generally relating to our voice data synchronization technology and data capture technique and six patent applications pending 
there is no guarantee that our pending applications will result in issued patents or  if issued  that they will provide us with any competitive advantages 
we cannot assure you that we will file further patent  trademark or copyright applications  that any future applications will be approved  that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will adequately protect our intellectual property or that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  one or more of our existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights may be found to be invalid or unenforceable 
we are aware of certain uses  us trademark registrations  and us trademark applications for the trademark equality and its variations that predate our use of  and us trademark application for  our trademark equality 
it is possible that the us patent and trademark office will deny our us trademark application 
in addition  it is possible that the owner of legal rights resulting from one or more of these prior uses  us trademark registrations  or us trademark applications will bring legal action to prevent us from registering and or using the trademark equality  and may also seek compensation for damages resulting from our use of this trademark 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our efforts to use and register this trademark will ultimately be successful  or that this use will not result in liability for trademark infringement  trademark dilution  and or unfair competition 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
if we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  would likely divert valuable management and product development resources and could involve a high degree of risk  regardless of whether we win or lose the litigation 
we rely on technology licensed from third parties  including databases  application programming interfaces  developmental tools and software necessary to integrate our software with third party technology and products 
in addition  third party products are bundled with our software 
if we lose access to this technology  or if it is not available to us on reasonable terms  it could cause delays in our development and introduction of new and enhanced software until we can obtain equivalent or replacement technology  if available  or develop this technology internally  if feasible 
if we lost access to technology that is bundled with our software  this would require us to modify or redesign our software and could cause a delay in our ability to market and sell our current software  or a delay in our ability to develop  market and sell new or enhanced software 
this delay or a failure to obtain replacement technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims by other companies that our software infringes their intellectual property could require us to incur substantial expenses or prevent us from selling our software or services if any of our software violates the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to reengineer or redevelop our software  seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our software without substantial reengineering  or conduct studies of such intellectual property rights so as to evaluate whether such intellectual property rights are valid or enforceable 
any efforts to reengineer our software or obtain licenses 
table of contents from third parties may not be successful  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
our efforts to study the intellectual property rights of third parties may not be successful and could reveal that such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
in addition  in the rapidly developing technological environment in which we operate  third parties may have filed a number of patent applications  many of which are confidential when filed 
if our software is found to violate these patents when they are issued or any other intellectual property of others  we may become subject to claims for infringement 
an infringement claim against us could result in the loss of our proprietary rights and  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or require us to pay damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms that are unfavorable to us 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  our customers may become subject to claims if the software they license from us is alleged to infringe the intellectual property of others 
if we decide to  or are forced to  litigate any of these claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming  could divert our management s attention from other matters  and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
litigation and intellectual property claims against us could also disrupt our sale of software 
additionally  it could lead to claims by third parties against our customers and others using our software 
our customers and these other users of our software would likely hold us responsible for these claims and any resulting harm they suffer 
we expect that we and other participants in our industry and related industries will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors with patent and other intellectual property portfolios in these industries grows 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and we cannot assure you that necessary licenses or similar arrangements will be made available to us on a reasonable basis or at all 
consequently  if we become subject to an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or we fail to obtain necessary licenses it could prevent us from producing and selling some or potentially all of the components of our software 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our future success also depends upon the continued ability of our software to be compatible with the products and other technologies offered by other software and hardware companies our software must integrate with software and hardware solutions provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors 
these competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our software no longer integrates well with them  or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our software to integrate with their products 
they could thus effectively prevent us from modifying our software to keep pace with the changing technology of their products 
if we cannot adapt our software to changes in our competitors technology  it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively  particularly if our software must integrate with the software and hardware solutions of our competitors 
new products may not be compatible with our software  but may be compatible with the products of our competitors 
for example  our products must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors  and computer telephony software applications offered by other software providers 
if our products are not compatible with the new technologies offered by other software and hardware companies  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if the market in which we sell our software and services does not grow as we anticipate  we will be unable to continue our growth the market for customer relationship management software  including software that records and analyzes customer interactions  is still emerging 
in addition  we are continuing to expand our product offering with products such as equality discover 
if the market for this software does not grow as quickly or become as 
table of contents large as we anticipate  we may not be able to continue our growth or may grow more slowly than expected 
continued growth in demand for this software remains uncertain because our potential customers may not understand the benefits of using customer relationship management software generally or  more specifically  software which records and analyzes the interactions between a business and its customers  not achieve favorable results using this software  experience technical difficulty in implementing this software  or use alternative methods such as online self help to solve the same business problems this software is intended to address 
in addition  our software is designed to address the needs of contact centers 
if the number of contact centers does not increase as we expect  or if it grows more slowly than we anticipate  we may not be able to continue our growth or may grow more slowly than expected 
if we do not continue to expand the distribution of our products through direct and indirect sales channels  we may be unable to expand our market share or increase our revenue to expand our market share and revenue  attract new customers and increase sales to existing customers  we will need to expand our direct and indirect channels of distribution 
although we received approximately of our revenue from direct sales for the year ended december   we will require an increase in our direct sales to achieve our growth plans 
to accomplish this  we will need to expand our direct sales force by hiring additional sales personnel and management  and increase the number of relationships we have with companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads for new business 
historically  it has taken us up to six months to train new sales personnel before they reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we have also experienced difficulty in finding new sales personnel with experience in computer and telephone integration technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to find an adequate number of new sales personnel meeting our specific needs 
if the personnel we hire are less qualified  it may take us more time to train them and they may take a longer time to reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire the necessary sales personnel and management on reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  we will be required to train any new personnel  and the new personnel may not reach full productivity for a long period of time 
we also intend to derive revenue from our indirect sales channel through relationships with companies that resell our software 
in particular  we intend to use resellers to increase our sales internationally and to market our software to small and medium contact centers 
through december   we have entered into agreements with only a small number of companies that resell our software and companies that provide us with customer referrals 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue was generated through these resellers 
when we enter into agreements with these companies  they are not exclusive and may ordinarily be terminated by either party 
some of these companies have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain productive relationships or that we will be able to establish similar relationships with additional companies on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  we cannot be certain that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our software and services 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  we will not be able to increase our revenue and our business will suffer 
if our internal professional services employees do not provide installation services effectively and according to schedule  our customers may not use our implementation services or may stop using our software customers that license our products ordinarily purchase installation  training and maintenance services  which they typically obtain from our internal professional services organization 
because our software must be installed to work with a number of computer and telephone network systems  installation of our software can be difficult 
these systems vary greatly from one customer site to another  and the versions and integration 
table of contents requirements of these third party systems change frequently 
we believe that the speed and quality of installation services are competitive factors in our industry 
if our installation services are not satisfactory to our customers  the customers may choose to not use our implementation services to install software they license from us 
in addition  these customers may determine that they will not license our software and instead will use the products and services of one of our competitors 
if this happens  we would lose licensing and services revenue from these customers  and it would likely harm our reputation in the industry in which we compete 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we need additional financing to maintain or expand our business  it may not be available on favorable terms  or at all although we believe our current cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months and the foreseeable future  we may need additional funds to expand or meet all of our operating needs 
if we need additional financing  we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the ownership interest of our stockholders would be significantly diluted  and any additional equity securities we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our stockholders 
also  the terms of any additional financing we obtain may significantly limit our future financing and operating activities 
if we need funds and cannot raise them on acceptable terms  we may be forced to sell assets or seek to refinance our outstanding obligations 
we may also be unable to develop and enhance our software to remain competitive  take advantage of future opportunities  such as acquisitions  respond to changing customer needs and our competitors innovations  or attract and retain qualified key personnel 
any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition and limit our growth 
seasonal trends in sales of business software or customer interaction levels may affect our quarterly revenue the market for business software has experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the first and third quarters of the year have been typically characterized by slightly longer sales cycles related to holiday and vacation schedules 
we believe that these fluctuations are caused in part by customer buying patterns  which are influenced by year end budgetary pressures and by sales force commission structures 
customer interaction centers typically experience much higher volumes of customer contact during and immediately following the year end holiday season 
as a result  many customers may elect to defer installation of our software during this time 
this has caused us to experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue 
we expect to face difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which are necessary to effectively manage and expand our business our future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire  train  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly in sales  marketing  research and development  service and support 
in particular  competition for research and development personnel with computer and telephone integration skills is intense  and turnover of technical personnel is particularly high in our industry 
we expect to face additional difficulties retaining personnel who have stock options with exercise prices above the fair market value of our stock 
in order to retain some of our personnel  we will need to grant additional options to purchase common stock to these employees with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock  which will cause dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience high personnel turnover  it would increase our costs of operations and could prevent us from effectively managing and expanding our business 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  david gould 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
gould 
table of contents and limited non compete agreements with all of our executive officers 
however  any of our executive officers and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  if one or more of our executive officers or key employees were to join one of our competitors or otherwise compete with us  it could harm our business 
our failure to properly manage our rapid growth could strain our resources and make it difficult to support our future operations our business could suffer if we fail to effectively manage our growth 
our revenue increased approximately and during the years ended december  and  respectively  from the previous year 
although we expect revenue to grow on an annual basis  we do not expect to maintain this same rate of revenue growth year over year 
from december  to december   the number of our employees increased from approximately to this growth in our revenue and number of employees has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems  controls and other resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  it may be difficult to support our future operations 
to manage growth effectively  we must accurately predict the growth in demand for our software and expand our capacity and implementation services to meet that demand  expand and improve our operating and financial systems  procedures and controls  attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key personnel  expand our facilities  successfully integrate the operations and personnel of any businesses we acquire  and respond quickly and effectively to unanticipated changes in our industry 
government regulation of telephone and internet monitoring could cause a decline in the use of our software  result in increased expenses for us or subject us and our customers to liability as the telecommunications industry continues to evolve  state  federal and foreign governments may increasingly regulate the monitoring of telecommunications and telephone and internet monitoring and recording products  such as our software 
we believe that increases in regulation could come in the form of a number of different kinds of laws  including privacy and employment regulations 
the adoption of new laws governing the use of our software or changes made to existing laws could cause a decline in the use of our software and could result in increased expenses for us  particularly if we are required to modify our software to accommodate these new or changing laws 
moreover  new laws or changes to existing laws could subject us and our customers to liability 
in addition  whether or not these laws are adopted  if we do not adequately address the privacy concerns of consumers  companies may be hesitant to use our software 
if any of these events occur  it could materially and adversely affect our business 
our management and affiliates control a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval at march   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates together controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this control may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control of witness systems and could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of any sale or acquisition 
future sales of common stock and the rights of some of our stockholders to register sales of their stock could adversely affect the market price of our stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock can cause the market price of our common stock to decline or can make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future 
the 
table of contents shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering generally are freely tradable without restriction 
at march    shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act 
the holders of these shares of common stock may sell them in the future without registration under the securities act if they comply with rule  rule or any other applicable exemption under the securities act 
some of our existing stockholders have the right to require us to register under the securities act shares of their common stock at any time 
once we register these shares  they can be freely sold in the public market 
our stock price has been volatile the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
any announcement with respect to any adverse variance in revenue or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts or investors for a given period could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  changing conditions in the market for products that record and analyze customer interactions  changes in estimates by securities analysts  announcements of extraordinary events  such as acquisitions or litigation  or general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  may prevent or delay a future takeover our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms which makes it difficult to remove all our directors at once 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  delaware law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation
