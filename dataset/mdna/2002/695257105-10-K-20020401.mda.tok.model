critical accounting policies following are the accounting policies of pactiv that  in the company s opinion  are the most important in portraying its financial conditions and results of operations

the company firmly believes its policies closely adhere to generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and that the financial position and results of pactiv are stated fairly 
sales deductions in arriving at net sales  the company estimates the amount of sales deductions likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs such as volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
such estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the company believes the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   are reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales might increase or decrease by a material amount

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks  the company  from time to time  enters into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency exchange the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  primarily related to the euro  british pound  and canadian dollar

estimated maturity dates thereafter total in millions facilities with floating interest rates based on libor year revolving credit facility debt securities with fixed interest rates long term debt securities  prior to the spin off  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements 
the company settled this swap in november  incurring a million loss  which is being recognized as additional interest expense over the average life of the underlying debt 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert floating rate debt on its synthetic lease obligations to fixed rate debt 
this action was taken to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with changes in value recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
as of december   million of deferred net losses on derivative instruments was recorded in other comprehensive income 
because of the highly effective nature of the swaps as defined in sfas no 
 there was no impact on the earnings of the company 
see note to the financial statements for further information concerning the company s synthetic leases 
commodities the company purchases commodities such as resin  paper  and aluminum at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company occasionally enters into short term forward contracts with third parties to fix a portion of the cost of natural gas used internally 
several of such contracts remained open at december  in december  the company entered into an agreement with one of its vendors to purchase certain materials at prices within a specified range 
effective december  this agreement was terminated by mutual consent 
the statements and other information including the tables in this annual report constitute forward looking statements
