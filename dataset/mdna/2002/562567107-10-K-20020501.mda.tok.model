item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal compared with fiscal significant factors affecting results of operations in fiscal september  the terrorist attacks of september   had a pronounced effect on our operating results for the year ended january  this effect was felt primarily at our las vegas properties  which generate approximately two thirds of our operating income 
our las vegas properties  with almost  hotel rooms  are dependent on air travel for a significant portion of their customers 
this is particularly true at our more upscale resorts  mandalay bay and luxor  where over of the hotel customers arrive via plane 
as a result of the terrorist attacks  air travel plummeted nationally 
passenger counts at mccarran international airport in las vegas fell almost over the last four months of  leading to an overall decline for the year 
visitor volume to las vegas declined in  despite being up for the year to date period prior to september the decreases in air traffic and visitor volume caused declines in the number of customers staying at and visiting our las vegas properties 
this situation was particularly acute immediately following the attacks  when occupancy levels at our las vegas properties fell to the mid range  compared to a normal occupancy above 
these factors led to declines in revenues and operating income at our las vegas properties during the fiscal year 
our operations in reno  laughlin and jean  nevada  were not as vulnerable to the aftermath of september these markets are essentially drive in markets 
while air traffic fell sharply following the attacks  automobile traffic to laughlin and jean actually rose  while traffic to reno showed a modest drop 
our joint venture properties in elgin  illinois  and detroit  michigan  did not reflect any adverse impact from the terrorist attacks  as their revenues and operating income after september were higher than they had been in the previous year 
these properties serve essentially locals markets a majority of our customers live within a relatively short distance of the properties and so were minimally affected by travel concerns in the aftermath of the attacks 
detroit also benefitted from the temporary closure of the us canadian border immediately following the terrorist attacks and from subsequently increased security  which impeded access from the us to a competing property in windsor  ontario 
in response to the terrorist attacks  we took several steps to minimize their effect on our operations and our financial position 
we temporarily until february suspended construction of our new convention center at mandalay bay see financial position and capital resources for more details  delayed or suspended all other discretionary capital spending  and laid off a portion of our workforce 
we laid off approximately  employees at the beginning of october out of a total workforce of over  employees  including those at our joint ventures  mostly at our las vegas properties 
additionally  wage levels were frozen for nonunion personnel and bonuses were reduced for many management level employees 
we also made several financing decisions designed to enhance our liquidity  such as amending our credit facilities to ease financial covenants  issuing additional senior subordinated notes and entering into additional operating lease arrangements 
see financial position and capital resources for additional details regarding these financing activities 
we cannot predict the extent to which the events of september will continue to directly or indirectly impact our operating results in the future  nor can we predict the extent to which future security alerts and or additional terrorist attacks may impact our operations 
economic recession historically  there has not been a high correlation between economic conditions and our operating results 
this has been true with respect to the overall us economy and also the regional economies from which we derive a substantial portion of our customers eg  california 
however  we believe the broad economic recession that affected the country throughout most of and into  and that was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  contributed to the downturn in our results for fiscal expansion of native american gaming on march   california voters approved proposition a  which amended the california constitution and legalized nevada style gaming on native american reservations 
the passage of this amendment has allowed the expansion of existing native american gaming operations  as well as the opening of new ones 
significant expansion occurred in the latter part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal the result has been a decline in operating results at our properties in the secondary markets of reno  laughlin and jean  nevada 
the impact of expanded native american gaming has been particularly significant at the gold strike and nevada landing in jean  and was the principal factor behind the impairment loss that was recognized at those properties in fiscal see discussion under results of operations 
while most existing native american gaming facilities in california are modest compared to our nevada casinos  numerous native american tribes have announced they are developing or are considering establishing large scale hotel and gaming facilities in california 
numerous other tribes are at various stages of planning new or expanded facilities 
the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california as well as elsewhere in the country could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  versus million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the decrease in earnings per share was attributable primarily to an impairment loss of million in fiscal related to the write down of the carrying value of our two jean properties  gold strike and nevada landing 
this write down reflects the downturn in operating results at these properties over the past few years due to the continued expansion of native american casinos in california 
the write down was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
of the million write down  million represented goodwill 
results for fiscal also include preopening expenses of million related to the new convention center currently under construction at mandalay bay 
fiscal earnings were affected as well by the september attacks  the recession  the expansion of native american gaming and higher utility costs 
utility costs rose million  or  at our wholly owned properties  with most of the increase attributable to our las vegas strip properties 
utility costs were higher due to the spillover effect from the california energy crisis 
the negative effect of all of the above factors on our earnings per share was partially offset by a lower number of average diluted shares outstanding million in fiscal versus million in fiscal due to our purchase of shares 
see financial position and capital resources for a discussion of our share purchase activity 
results for fiscal included preopening expenses of million related to the shark reef at mandalay bay  which opened june  results also included million in income related to reducing a liability assumed when the mandalay bay site was acquired in revenues revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended january  the decrease was due primarily to the effect of september on our las vegas strip properties  whose revenues were down million  or including our share of the operating income of monte carlo 
revenues also declined at our other nevada properties  mainly because of expanded native american gaming in california 
in reno revenues decreased million  or including our share of the operating income of silver legacy  in laughlin they were down million  or  and in jean they were down million  or 
these declines were partially offset by a million  or  increase in revenues at motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
casino revenues casino revenues declined million  or  in fiscal casino revenues declined at all of our major wholly owned properties due to the impact of the significant factors discussed previously 
these declines were partially offset by a million  or  increase in casino revenues at motorcity casino 
room revenues room revenues fell million  or  in fiscal our las vegas properties experienced strong growth in revenue per available room revpar through the first part of the year  mainly as a result of increases in room rates 
however  following september  occupancy rates declined dramatically and room rates were discounted in order to stimulate demand 
as a result  revpar fell noticeably in the last quarter of the year

other revenues other revenues rose million  or  in fiscal other revenues come principally from amusements  retail stores and entertainment 
most of the increase was due to the success of blue man group  the unique off broadway production which debuted in march at luxor 
the april opening of our new production  storm  in the mandalay bay showroom also contributed to the increase  as did the shark reef at mandalay bay which opened june 
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates we record our share of the operating income of our unconsolidated joint ventures grand victoria  monte carlo and silver legacy as revenue under earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
results from the owned motorcity casino are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased million  or  in fiscal decreases in results at monte carlo and silver legacy were largely offset by an increase at grand victoria 
income from operations for the year ended january   income from operations declined million  or  from the previous year 
the composite operating margin in fiscal was versus in fiscal the previously discussed impairment loss of million recognized at our jean properties was a principal cause of the declines in operating income and operating margin 
our las vegas strip properties also contributed to the declines  as the effects of september depressed results in that market  particularly in the hotel department where our operating margins are typically the highest

ebitda is included because  as in other entertainment industries  many investors consider it a key benchmark  since it factors out the impact of depreciation and goodwill amortization  the principal noncash expenses affecting our income 
ebitda is not an accepted measure of performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to gaap measures of performance 
includes circus circus las vegas and slots a fun 
includes gold strike  nevada landing and railroad pass 
motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall decrease in operating income of million  or  for fiscal at mandalay bay  operating income rose million  or  due primarily to increases in room rates that were achieved during the first part of the fiscal year  prior to the events of september because of the upscale clientele at this property  it possesses greater pricing leverage than our other properties 
operating income at our other las vegas properties declined for the year  tracking the lower revenues that followed september at excalibur operating income was down million  or  at luxor it was down million  or  and at circus circus it was off by million  or 
the contribution from monte carlo also declined  falling million  or  for the year 
reno operating income from our reno properties including our share of silver legacy was down million  or  in fiscal  despite the presence in reno of the men s national bowling tournament 
operating results at our reno properties have been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming in california and the northwestern us the events of september also contributed to the decline in operating income 
laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  posted a combined decrease in operating income of million  or  for fiscal while revpar was flat  casino revenues decreased 
like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino generated operating income of million  an increase of over the prior year 
results at this property have steadily improved since its december opening 
the property also benefitted from the temporary closure of the us canadian border immediately following the september attacks 
this measure  along with subsequently increased security  impeded access from the us to a competing property in windsor  ontario 
we believe motorcity casino has been able to attract a significant number of customers who previously frequented the competing property in windsor 
see financial position and capital resources for additional details regarding our detroit operation 
in tunica county  mississippi  operating income at gold strike decreased million  or  during fiscal we believe the slow economy has had a more pronounced effect on this region  and especially on memphis  tennessee  which accounts for over half the property s customer base 
the contribution to income from operations from grand victoria a owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois increased million  or  for fiscal this market was apparently not negatively impacted by the terrorist attacks on september it may have actually benefitted to the extent potential customers in this market were less willing to travel outside the region 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million versus million in fiscal these amounts include goodwill amortization of million in each year 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas provides that goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will instead be reviewed for impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
sfas took effect for the company beginning february  we have begun our review of existing goodwill for impairment 
after the review is complete  any impairment will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the quarter ended april  for fiscal  we estimate that our depreciation expense will be approximately million 
interest expense in fiscal  interest expense excluding interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures and without reduction for capitalized interest increased million over fiscal the increase was due to the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in july  the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes in august  and the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in december the net proceeds from these offerings were used to pay down lower cost borrowings outstanding under our bank facility 
the higher interest rates on the notes we issued were largely offset by lower average interest rates on our bank facility  as well as lower average borrowings outstanding 
we recorded interest expense related to unconsolidated joint ventures of million in fiscal compared with million in the prior year 
these amounts reflect our share of the interest expense of silver legacy and monte carlo 
the decrease was attributable primarily to lower average interest rates 
on march   silver legacy issued million of mortgage notes due contemporaneously with the issuance of the notes  silver legacy entered into a new senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million amortizing term loan 
the net proceeds of the note offering  combined with draws under the new credit facility  were used to repay the prior credit facility million and to fund a million distribution to the silver legacy partners million of which was distributed to mandalay 
immediately following the transactions  total long term debt for silver legacy was approximately million 
at january   long term debt including current portion stood at billion compared to billion at january  the fiscal total included million of debt related to motorcity casino  while the fiscal total included million of debt related to motorcity 
capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
capitalized interest in fiscal related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay 
capitalized interest in the prior year was associated with the shark reef at mandalay bay 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses  primarily the amortization of goodwill 
the higher rate in fiscal was due to the impairment loss of million 
as previously discussed  million of this loss represented the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
for fiscal  we estimate our effective tax rate will be  with the reduction attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas  as discussed previously 
fiscal compared with fiscal results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  versus million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended january  the increase in earnings was due mostly to strong operating performances at our las vegas strip properties and at grand victoria in elgin  illinois 
motorcity casino  our owned joint venture in detroit  michigan  was also a factor  as it contributed a full year of operations in fiscal against less than two months of operations in fiscal the casino opened december  
higher interest expense  stemming from higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates  offset some of the operating gains 
share purchases also benefitted earnings per share comparisons  as average diluted shares outstanding decreased to million from million in the prior year 
results for fiscal include preopening expenses of million related to our saltwater aquarium attraction  the shark reef at mandalay bay  which opened june  results for fiscal also include million in income related to reducing a liability assumed when the mandalay bay site was acquired in results for fiscal include preopening expenses of million related primarily to mandalay bay and motorcity casino including the write off of million of previously capitalized preopening costs and the write off of million related to a timeshare project we decided not to pursue 
revenues revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from the prior year 
the increase was attributable primarily to motorcity casino  which generated revenues of million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  when it was open only one month 
mandalay bay  which was open an additional month in fiscal  also contributed in a significant fashion  with a revenue increase of million  or 
casino revenues casino revenues rose million  or  during fiscal due primarily to a full year of operations at motorcity casino 
casino revenues at that property rose to million from million the previous year 
meanwhile  casino revenues at our las vegas strip properties rose a combined 
the increase was driven by mandalay bay  whose casino revenues grew million  or  mainly because of the additional month of operations and an upturn in high budget play 
room revenues room revenues in fiscal rose million  or 
the growth came principally from our las vegas strip properties  whose revenue per available room revpar increased over the prior year 
mandalay bay again led the way  with an average room rate of compared to in the prior year 
the growth in revpar was driven by increased demand stemming from a continued rise in the number of visitors to las vegas up for calendar year

this increase was driven largely by a full year of operations at motorcity casino  where food and beverage revenues increased million over the prior year 
also stimulating food and beverage revenues were selective price increases at our las vegas strip properties 
other revenues other revenues rose million  or  in fiscal other revenues come principally from amusements  retail stores and entertainment 
most of the increase was attributable to luxor  where these revenues rose million due primarily to the success of blue man group  our unique off broadway production which debuted in march the shark reef at mandalay bay  another instant success  opened in june and contributed to a million increase in other revenues at the property 
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates we record our share of the operating income of our unconsolidated joint ventures grand victoria  monte carlo and silver legacy as revenue under earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
results for motorcity casino are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million in fiscal  with most of the increase attributable to the owned grand victoria

motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall increase in operating income of million  or  during fiscal this increase was driven by an uptrend in the number of visitors to the las vegas strip  as discussed previously 
at mandalay bay  operating income rose million in fiscal mandalay bay benefitted from an extra month of operations in fiscal compared to the prior year the property opened march  
mandalay bay s fiscal operating income was also affected by preopening expenses 
at luxor  operating income rose million  or 
meanwhile  operating income at excalibur rose million  or  while at circus circus las vegas it rose million  or 
the contribution from monte carlo also rose  up million  or  compared with the prior year 
reno circus circus posted an increase in operating income of million  or 
meanwhile  our share of operating income from silver legacy declined million from fiscal see note below 
fiscal results were boosted by a national bowling tournament which reno hosts two out of every three years 
the city hosted the women s national tournament from march through july  but did not host any tournament in the prior year 
this contributed to modest increases in casino revenues and revpar at both properties 
we believe the reno market encountered increased competition from native american casinos in northern california 
in the latter half of fiscal  following the passage of proposition  these native american casinos began adding more and newer ie  more competitive slot machines 
note in fiscal  we recorded approximately two thirds of silver legacy s operating income as a priority return on our investment 
in fiscal  we recorded our normal share of silver legacy s operating income 
had we recorded of silver legacy s operating income in fiscal instead of two thirds  our share of operating income from silver legacy would have increased by million instead of declining by million 
laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  together posted a decrease in operating income of million  or  for fiscal while revpar was essentially flat for the year  casino revenues were down 
like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
furthermore  a lack of health care options in this small community contributed to a rise in health care costs 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino delivered operating income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this comparison reflects a full months of operation in fiscal as against one and one half months in fiscal in tunica county  mississippi  operating income at gold strike decreased million  or  during fiscal growth in this market continued to slow as competition for business heightened leading to a flattening of results 
the contribution to income from operations by grand victoria a owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois grew by million  or 
this property benefitted from more profitable dockside gaming operations throughout all of fiscal  whereas it was limited to cruising operations in the first half of fiscal depreciation and amortization in fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense rose million  to million 
this increase derived primarily from the addition of motorcity casino 
interest expense in fiscal  interest expense excluding interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures and without reduction for capitalized interest climbed million 
the increase was due partially to higher average borrowings approximately billion in fiscal against approximately billion in fiscal  which were partly related to the purchase of approximately million shares of our common stock during fiscal average borrowings also increased due to borrowings associated with motorcity casino 
additionally  interest expense reflected higher interest rates on our credit line borrowings  as well as the effect of the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in july and the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes in august the proceeds from these two offerings were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
at january   long term debt including current portion stood at billion compared to billion at january  the fiscal total included million of debt related to motorcity casino  while the fiscal figure included million of debt related to motorcity 
capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capitalized interest was higher in the prior year due to the inclusion of one month of capitalized interest on mandalay bay  which opened march  we recorded interest expense related to unconsolidated joint ventures of million in fiscal compared with million in the previous year 
these amounts reflect our share of the interest expense of silver legacy and monte carlo 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses  primarily the amortization of goodwill 
financial position and capital resources operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was attributable to several factors  including a decrease in deferred taxes  a smaller increase in interest payable  lower distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and lower net income stemming from september deferred taxes decreased million in fiscal due primarily to the write down of our jean properties  which is not deductible for tax purposes until the assets are actually disposed of 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to improved results at our las vegas strip properties mandalay bay was open for a full year versus only months in fiscal and improved results at grand victoria in elgin  illinois 
motorcity casino was also a factor  contributing a full year of operations in fiscal against less than two months in fiscal mandalay had cash and cash equivalents of million at january   sufficient for normal daily operating requirements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures and the related increase or decrease in construction payables accounted for most of these amounts 
capital expenditures for fiscal  which were funded primarily from cash flow  totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of a new convention center at mandalay bay scheduled to open in january see new projects for additional details 
another million related to the completion of the renovation of the pyramid rooms at luxor 
capital expenditures also included million related to the acquisition of land adjacent to our temporary casino facility in detroit 
for fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the shark reef at mandalay bay  a saltwater aquarium attraction which opened june   and million related to the renovation of the luxor rooms 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  of which million related to the completion of mandalay bay and other core components of mandalay mile  and million related to the shark reef 
with respect to fiscal  we estimate that capital expenditures will be in the range of million 
the majority of these expenditures will relate to the completion of the new convention center at mandalay bay 
these estimated capital expenditures also include maintenance capital spending  which consists of items necessary to maintain the operating condition of our properties  such as new slot machines  carpeting  computers and similar equipment 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be funded primarily from cash flow  though we also have funds available under our bank credit facilities 
actual capital expenditures for fiscal may differ significantly from the estimated range 
financing activities for fiscal  financing activities used net cash of million  which included the purchase of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
see share purchases for further discussion of our share purchase activity 
we also paid million related to interim settlements and interest under our equity forward agreements with bank of america 
see the discussion under equity forward agreements for more details 
for fiscal  financing activities used net cash of million  most of which related to the purchase of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
for fiscal  financing activities provided net cash of million  stemming primarily from an increase in net borrowings to fund the construction of mandalay bay 
credit facilities in august  we replaced our billion unsecured credit facility  dated may   with three separate facilities that totaled billion 
these credit facilities included a million capital markets term loan facility which was paid in full using a portion of the net proceeds we received from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in december discussed more fully below 
by paying off the capital markets term loan facility  we reduced our borrowing capacity to billion under the two remaining facilities 
the remaining credit facilities  which are for general corporate purposes  include a million term loan facility the entire amount of which was outstanding at january  and an million revolving facility million of which was outstanding at january  
each of our credit facilities is unsecured and provides for the payment of interest  at our option  either at a rate equal to or an increment above the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal reserve board federal funds rate plus basis points  or a eurodollar based rate 
at january   the effective rate of interest on the indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities was 
each of our credit facilities includes financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage  plus covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets  make distributions on our capital stock  engage in a merger  incur liens and engage in transactions with our affiliates 
the entire principal amount then outstanding under our credit facilities becomes due and payable on august   unless the maturity date is extended with the consent of the lenders 
in december  we amended the covenants under each of our credit facilities to provide for more liberal tests for total debt and interest coverage 
these amendments were obtained to address the impact of the events of september the amended covenants were effective with the quarter ended january   and will continue to provide relief through the quarter ending april  as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our credit facilities  including those related to total debt and interest coverage  and under the most restrictive covenant  we had the ability to issue additional debt of approximately million 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow 
senior subordinated senior notes on july   the company issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due august and on august   the company issued million principal amount of senior notes due august these notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our then existing credit facility 
on december   we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february these notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facilities 
operating leases in october  we entered into a million operating lease agreement with a group of financial institutions to lease equipment at mandalay bay 
pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement  the commitment under our then existing bank credit facility was permanently reduced by million 
in december  we entered into a series of additional operating lease agreements totaling million with a group of financial institutions 
these leases cover equipment located at several nevada properties 
since this equipment was originally purchased by us  the transaction constituted a sale and leaseback of this equipment 
the sale of the equipment resulted in the recognition of a net deferred gain of million 
the proceeds from these leases were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities  thereby providing additional borrowing capacity and improving leverage under our bank covenants 
we entered into the above operating leases solely to provide greater financial flexibility  they are not considered a material source of financing 
the rent expense related to these operating leases is reported separately in the consolidated statements of income as operating lease rent 
the operating lease agreements contain financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage that are identical to those under our credit facilities 
the agreements also contain covenants regarding maintenance of the equipment  insurance requirements and prohibitions on liens 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in these agreements 
the leases provide that  at maturity  we may elect to purchase the equipment for a stated purchase option amount which is equal to the estimated fair value of the equipment at that date  as determined by an independent appraisal 
if we choose not to purchase the equipment  we may be obligated to pay additional amounts under the lease provisions 
we are exposed to risks under these lease agreements as follows to the extent we are unable to make required lease payments  the equipment could be foreclosed  which could have a detrimental impact on our operating results  and to the extent we are financially unable to purchase the equipment or similar replacement equipment at maturity  our ability to operate our properties could be impaired  which could likewise have a negative impact on our operating results 
we do not consider these risks to be significant due to our historically strong production of cash flow and our access to various other forms of capital

new projects mandalay bay convention center we have commenced construction of a convention and meeting complex located on land adjacent to the existing mandalay bay conference center 
the complex will include more than one million square feet of exhibit space 
upon completion of the project  mandalay bay will offer a total of almost two million gross square feet of conference and exhibit space 
following the events of september  construction of the facility was temporarily suspended 
we resumed construction in february and currently expect the facility to open in january the cost of the convention center  excluding land  preopening expenses and capitalized interest  is estimated to be million 
as of january   we had incurred costs of million related to this project 
detroit we participate with the detroit based atwater casino group in a joint venture that owns and operates a temporary casino in detroit  michigan 
this joint venture is one of three groups which negotiated casino development agreements with the city 
we have a ownership interest in the joint venture 
pending the development of a permanent hotel casino  the joint venture constructed a temporary casino motorcity casino in downtown detroit  which opened december  the cost of the temporary casino  including land and capitalized interest but excluding preopening expenses  was approximately million 
this cost was financed through the joint venture s million credit facility  which is secured by the assets associated with the temporary casino 
we have guaranteed this credit facility  which had a balance of million at january  the joint venture s operation of the temporary casino is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight  and its ability to proceed with a permanent hotel casino project is contingent upon the receipt of all necessary gaming approvals and satisfaction of other conditions 
we are currently negotiating with the city of detroit concerning the location and scope of the permanent facility  however  we expect it to include hotel rooms  larger casino space  convention and meeting space  and dining and entertainment facilities 
we have committed to contribute of the cost of the permanent facility in the form of an investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture will seek to borrow the funds necessary to complete the permanent facility 
because of the uncertainty about the location and scope of the permanent facility  its cost has yet to be determined 
the current development agreement provides that we will guarantee completion of the permanent facility and will enter into a keep well agreement with the city  pursuant to which we could be required to contribute additional funds to continue operation of the permanent facility for a period of two years 
this keep well agreement also applies to the temporary casino 
there is no contractual limitation on the amount that we may be required to contribute to the joint venture in order to guarantee the completion of the permanent facility or to keep the project in operation for a period of two years 
however  based on the performance of the temporary casino to date  we do not expect that these guarantees will require the outlay of additional capital 
we have issued letters of credit totaling million for the benefit of bank of america in order to back letters of credit issued by bank of america for the same total amount

however  the sixth circuit reversed the district court s determination that i the lac vieux band lacked standing to challenge the ordinance  ii the first amendment is not implicated in the ordinance  and iii a rational basis review rather than a strict scrutiny review should be applied in determining the merits of the lac vieux equal protection claim regarding the ordinance

the plaintiff is taking the position in the district court that all three detroit casino licenses  including the motorcity casino license  should be rebid in a new competitive selection process and  in addition  that pending completion of the rebidding process  all three casinos should be placed in conservatorship under the michigan act 
motorcity casino and the other two detroit casinos have each filed briefs with the district court stating that  for various legal and equitable reasons  the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief it has requested 
the matter is presently pending before the district court which has declared that the ordinance in its current form is unconstitutional 
the effect of the rulings in this case is uncertain

depending on the eventual outcome of this litigation  the continued operation of our detroit joint venture s temporary facility  and or its ability to retain its certificate of suitability and casino license for its permanent facility  could be adversely affected or even precluded 
on february   john ren filed suit in the circuit court of wayne county  michigan against our detroit joint venture and the other two casino operations in detroit 
the plaintiff purports to represent himself and a class consisting of all persons who lost money and or incurred debts that remain unpaid at any of the three detroit casinos 
relying on the sixth circuit court of appeal s lac vieux decision  the plaintiff alleges that the three casinos have been operating illegally and continue to do so 
the relief sought by the plaintiff includes an injunction to restrain the three casinos from remaining open until properly licensed  compensatory damages  and disgorgement of all profits unjustly obtained 
on april   the wayne county circuit court dismissed the plaintiff s lawsuit 
the plaintiff has the right to appeal the dismissal of the lawsuit 
we continue to operate motorcity casino 
however  any future ruling by the court in either lawsuit or by the michigan gaming control board  as well as an adverse ruling in other lawsuits  could affect the joint venture s continued operation of the temporary facility  as well as its ability to retain its certificate of suitability and casino license for its permanent facility

in june  the board announced an additional authorization enabling us to purchase up to of our shares of common stock which remain outstanding after we have fully utilized the may authorization

equity forward agreements to facilitate our purchase of shares  we entered into equity forward agreements with bank of america b of a or the bank providing for the bank s purchase of up to an agreed amount of our outstanding common stock 
such purchases were to be in accordance with the volume and other limitations of rule b under the securities exchange act of the agreements  as amended  provide that on the settlement date  we will purchase from b of a the shares that the bank then holds 
for those shares  we will pay to b of a its acquisition cost as adjusted by any interim settlements plus accrued fees the settlement amount 
at our option  we may acquire all or a portion of the shares at an earlier date  or we may become obligated to acquire all or a portion of the shares at an earlier date under certain circumstances specified in the agreements 
the agreements provide for interim settlements whereby we may deliver or receive shares at the end of each calendar quarter so that the aggregate market value of the shares held by b of a is equal to the remaining notional amounts of the agreements 
the shares held by b of a at each interim settlement date are valued at the closing price of the stock on that date 
to the extent that the value of the shares exceeds the notional amount  b of a delivers equivalent shares to us 
to the extent the notional amount exceeds the value  we deliver equivalent shares to b of a 
bank of america acquired a total of million shares at a total cost of million under these agreements 
pursuant to the interim settlement provisions and an amendment to the agreements  we have received a net of million shares and reduced the notional amount of the agreements by million

upon final settlement of the agreements  b of a will be entitled to receive the settlement amount 
if we elect to net settle our obligation  and if the net proceeds from the sale of the shares held by b of a total less than the settlement amount  we will be required to pay the difference either in cash or in the form of shares with an equivalent value limited to the maximum number of shares under the agreement 
if the net proceeds from the sale of the shares held by b of a total more than the settlement amount  b of a will be required to pay us the difference either in cash or in the form of shares with an equivalent value 
the number of shares we ultimately acquire from b of a under these equity forward agreements will reduce  by an identical number  the shares we may purchase pursuant to our current share purchase authorizations 
our maximum exposure under the equity forward agreements is limited to the notional amount 
we incur quarterly interest charges on the notional amount at a current rate equal to libor plus 
total interest charges incurred from inception through january   amounted to million  of which million was incurred in fiscal in addition  we also incurred structuring fees and commissions totaling million  of which million was incurred in fiscal these interest charges and other fees are included in the cost of treasury stock 
liquidity we believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet all of our obligations 
these obligations include existing cash obligations  funding of capital commitments on projects under way  and any obligations that may arise pursuant to our equity forward agreements or our operating lease agreements both discussed above 
we also believe our capital resources are sufficient to provide for additional strategic purchases of our common stock or investments in new projects 
this belief is based upon our historically strong and dependable operating cash flows and our revolving credit facility 
we have also repeatedly demonstrated the ability to raise funds in the debt and equity markets  as most recently evidenced by our issuance in december of million of senior subordinated notes due our operating cash flows are exposed to the risk of a significant downturn in our business 
however  we do not believe this poses a significant liquidity risk because of the historical magnitude and stability of our cash flows 
furthermore  as of january   we had million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank facility which expires july  of which we could utilize million under the most restrictive of our loan covenants 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow

market risk and derivative financial instruments mandalay is exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our variable rate debt 
we manage this market risk by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
there were no material quantitative changes in our market risk exposure  or in how such risks were managed  during fiscal our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are initially matched either with specific fixed rate debt obligations or with levels of variable rate borrowings 
to manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk in interest rate swaps  we enter into agreements with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
frequently  these institutions are also members of the bank group providing our credit facilities  which management believes further minimizes the risk of nonperformance 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments both interest rate swaps and debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve 
implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates
