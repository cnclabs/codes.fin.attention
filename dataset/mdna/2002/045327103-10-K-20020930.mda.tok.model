table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our founding in  we have developed and marketed software and services to companies in the process industries 
in addition to internally generated growth  we have acquired a number of businesses  including hyprotech in the fourth quarter of fiscal  petrolsoft in the fourth quarter of fiscal  icarus in the first quarter of fiscal  broner systems in the second quarter of fiscal  and the houston consulting group and coppermine llc  a subsidiary of cpu that was formed to operate cpu s process applications business  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we acquired hyprotech  icarus  broner  the houston consulting group and coppermine in transactions accounted for as purchases 
our operating results include the operating results of these acquisitions only for periods subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we acquired petrolsoft in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements reflect the historic operations of petrolsoft for all periods 
we typically license our engineering solutions for terms of three to five years and license our manufacturing supply chain solutions for terms of years 
see item business solutions software and services 
software license revenues  including license renewals  consists principally of revenues earned under fixed term and perpetual software license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we determine vsoe based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
maintenance and support vsoe represents a consistent percentage of the license fees charged to customers 
consulting services vsoe represents standard rates  which we charge our customers when we sell our consulting services separately 
for an element not yet being sold separately  vsoe represents the price established by management having the relevant authority when it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before the separate introduction of the element into the marketplace 
revenues under license arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
we have established sufficient vsoe for professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
we use installment contracts as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
maintenance and support services revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance and support contract period 
maintenance and support services include telephone support and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements 
these services are typically sold for a one year term and are sold either as part of a multiple element arrangement with software licenses or are sold independently at time of renewal 
we do not provide specified upgrades to our customers in connection with the licensing of our software products 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount thereof is provided currently 
service revenues from time and expense contracts and consulting and training revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
services that have been performed but for which billings have not been made are recorded as unbilled services  and billings that have been recorded before the services have been performed are recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we license our software in us dollars and several foreign currencies 
we hedge material foreign currency denominated installments receivable with specific hedge contracts in amounts equal to those installments receivable 
historically  we experience minor foreign currency exchange gains or losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the impact of which have not been material in periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the us dollar weakened against european currencies  and we experienced foreign currency exchange losses primarily due to ineffective hedging of accounts receivable of our foreign subsidiaries  in particular hyprotech and its subsidiaries  that were denominated in currencies other than the local functional currencies 
we do not expect fluctuations in foreign currencies to have a significant impact on either our revenues or our expenses in the foreseeable future 
our operating costs for the years ended june  and include the amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill  arising from acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
the net balance of these intangible assets as of june  was million and was being amortized over periods ranging from two to twelve years 
the amortization from acquisitions that was charged to operations was million for fiscal and million for fiscal in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 companies no longer amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead assess for impairment using a fair value based test  on at least an annual basis 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
and stopped amortizing a net carrying value of million of intangible assets 
the amortization associated with these intangible assets was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
amortization expense related to intangible assets with definite lives existing as of july   that will continue to be amortized pursuant to sfas no 
will range from approximately million to million per quarter in fiscal and from million to million per quarter in fiscal thereafter  amortization expense related to existing acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets will continue to decline through fiscal critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition for both software licenses and fixed fee consulting services  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition software licenses we recognize software license revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
 as well as the various interpretations and clarifications of those statements 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between ourselves and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  
table of contents the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the fee is fixed and determinable and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables relating to such sales 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  all or substantially all of the software license revenue recognized for such transactions could be deferred from revenue 
revenue recognition consulting services we recognize revenue associated with fixed fee service contracts in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount of the anticipated loss is provided currently 
our management uses its judgment concerning the estimation of the total costs to complete the contract  considering a number of factors  including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services and the overall complexity of the project 
should changes and conditions cause actual results to differ significantly from management s estimates  revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  we review the carrying value of long lived assets and certain intangible assets periodically  based upon the expected future operating cash flows of our business 
these future cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as of july   which supercedes sfas no 
we believe that the critical estimates and judgments that will be applied after the adoption of sfas no 
will not be significantly different than those applied previously 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct at least an annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill assets 
we most recently performed this assessment as of january  we obtain a third party valuation of the reporting units associated with the goodwill assets  which is either based on estimates of future income from the reporting units or estimates of the market value of the units  based on comparable recent transactions 
these estimates of future income are based upon historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  the relevancy of recent transactions used to establish market value for our reporting units is based on management s judgment 
the timing and size of impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and estimates and could result in the write off of all or substantially all of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
tax assets also result from net operating losses  research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that 
table of contents our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could result in a tax provision equal to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required for all or substantially all of certain receivable balances

the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
lower software license revenues in fiscal were driven by significant delays in purchases by our customers in the process industries  due to the struggling economic environments in the united states and europe  which resulted in license revenues for the whole fiscal year being lower than our initially anticipated levels  all of which was offset by software licenses revenues recorded by hyprotech in fiscal

selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the increase in selling and marketing costs was primarily attributable to an expense base that increased in the initial part of fiscal to support an expected higher license revenue level  including our investment in additional headcount to support our initiatives in the areas of expanding partnerships  in addition to sales and marketing expenses contributed by hyprotech in june during fiscal  we continued to selectively invest in sales personnel and regional sales offices to improve our geographic proximity to our customers 
fiscal also included additional expenses as compared to fiscal relating to our plans to expand certain new business initiatives  including petrovantage 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct our product development efforts 
capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated remaining economic life of the relevant product  not to exceed three years 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the increase in costs was attributable to a full year of costs relating to the june acquisitions of certain technology divisions of cpu and the houston consulting group  non capitalizable costs incurred in association with the accenture strategic alliance  a general increase in normal development activities and costs contributed by hyprotech in june the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues is primarily related to lower than anticipated revenues 
we capitalized of our total research and development costs during fiscal of this amount  related to internal costs and costs incurred by accenture  as part of the accenture strategic alliance 
the remaining related to our traditional development efforts  as compared to in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  outside professional fees and amortization of intangibles 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
fiscal also includes million associated with the amortization of goodwill  for which there is no corresponding charge in fiscal  resulting in a comparative increase of million or 
these increases were due 
table of contents primarily to the full year of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of icarus  cpu and the houston consulting group  an increase to our bad debt reserve due to the current economic environment  an increase in certain non recurring professional fees and costs related to the settlement of minor litigation 
amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill in fiscal  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  respectively  a decrease of in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses contributed by hyprotech were not significant in fiscal restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  management undertook two separate restructuring plans 
the first occurred in august and amounted to million  primarily related to severance 
the second occurred in may and amounted to million  related to severance  facility consolidations and the write off of certain assets 
in addition  during fiscal  we revised estimates on previously recorded restructuring plans  resulting in a reversal of an aggregate million of facility accruals and a million increase to a severance settlement 
august restructuring plan 
during august  in light of economic uncertainties  management made a decision to adjust the business plan by reducing spending  which resulted in a restructuring charge of million  primarily for severance 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the changes to the business plan implemented by management 
areas impacted included sales and marketing  services  research and development  and general and administrative 
may restructuring plan 
in the third quarter of fiscal  revenues were lower than our expectations as customers delayed spending due to the general weakness in the economy 
like many other software companies  we reduced our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year based upon the impact of these reduced revenue expectations  management evaluated our current business and made significant changes  resulting in a restructuring plan for our operations 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in headcount  tighter cost controls  the close down and consolidation of facilities  and the write off of certain assets 
close down consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from several months to nine years 
the amount accrued reflects our best estimate of the actual costs to buy out leases or to sublease the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the changes to the business plan implemented by management 
business units impacted included sales and marketing  services  research and development  and general and administrative  across all geographic areas 
write off of assets approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the write off of prepaid royalties related to third party software products that we will no longer support 
adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
in march  due to revised sub lease assumptions at one of our facilities  we recorded a million reversal to the restructuring accrual that had been recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  due to revisions to the life of the expected sublease end dates for two facilities  we recorded million reversals to both the restructuring accrual that had been recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal charge for in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of hyprotech in may  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development projects based upon an independent appraisal 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 

table of contents at the acquisition date  hyprotech was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of its next generation product 
this project involved developing a new componentized architecture that would result in a next generation software suite 
in addition  design and development was in progress for the next release cycle for several of hyprotech s other products 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development ranged from to percent complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
anticipated completion dates ranged from three months to two years at an estimated cost of million 
in making this purchase price allocation  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items and an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from the projects are based on estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from the projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were considered appropriate for the in process research and development 
risks related to the completion of technology under development include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
interest income 
interest income is generated from investment of excess cash in short term and long term investments and from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts 
under these installment contracts  we offer a customer the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
historically  a substantial majority of the asset optimization customers have elected to license these products through installment contracts 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest rate established by us at the time of the license 
as we sell more perpetual licenses for value chain solutions  these sales are being paid for in forms that are generally not installment contracts 
if the mix of sales moves away from installment contracts  interest income in future periods will be reduced 
we sell a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by us on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest rate established by us on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to the general decline in interest rates during fiscal which effected interest earned on installment contracts and our short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was incurred under our convertible debentures  bank line of credit and capital lease obligations 
interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal write off of investment 
during fiscal and we invested million in optimum logistics ltd 
consisting of cash and stock  of which was refunded in march this investment entitled us to a minority interest in optimum logistics and was accounted for using the cost method 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that our investment in optimum logistics was impaired and this investment of million was written off  in addition to million of other write offs 
foreign currency exchange loss 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily incurred through the revaluation of receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to the weakening of the us dollar against european currencies and translation losses attributable to hyprotech s receivables during the month of june for which we had not yet implemented an effective hedging policy 

table of contents income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments 
income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal this consisted entirely of income on equity in joint ventures 
in fiscal  this primarily consisted of million of realized gains on the partial sale of two investments and million of income on equity in joint ventures 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and a benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for fiscal represents income taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not have operating loss carryforwards 
we generated significant us tax loss carryforwards during both fiscal and the provision for fiscal also included a benefit from income taxes and a corresponding increase in the tax valuation of million as discussed below 
under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
in fiscal  we concluded  in accordance with sfas no 
 that we should not recognize the full value of our deferred tax asset under the more likely than not test and therefore increased the amount of the valuation allowance

the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal higher software license revenues in fiscal were driven by strong demand from the petroleum sector and a increase in sales in the first half of the fiscal year compared to the first half of fiscal in the second half of fiscal  we saw a general delay in decision making from many customers  which resulted in license revenues for the whole fiscal year being lower than our initially anticipated levels  but still higher than license revenues in fiscal revenues from service and other for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal of this increase  million is attributable to the inclusion of reimbursable out of pocket expenses in service and other revenue for fiscal a corresponding amount is not reflected in fiscal as it would be impracticable to do so

restructuring and other charges 
in the third quarter of fiscal  revenues were lower than our expectations as customers delayed spending due to the widespread slowdown in it spending and the deferral of late quarter purchasing decisions 
like many other software companies  we reduced our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year based upon the impact of these reduced revenue expectations  management evaluated our current business and made significant changes  resulting in a restructuring plan for our operations 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in headcount  a substantial decrease in discretionary spending and a sharpening of our e business focus to emphasize our marketplace solutions and petrovantage 
close down consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge related to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from one month to six years

at the acquisition date  the houston consulting group was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with its orion refinery scheduling software  which will extend our supply chain planning and scheduling solutions for the petroleum industry 
the efforts consisted primarily of development of additional capabilities in the blending and scheduling aspects of the orion product family 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development ranged from to percent complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
anticipated development costs are million over a five month period 
during fiscal  development of this product was completed  with costs incurred at or near the original estimate 
in making each of these purchase price allocations  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items and an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present 
table of contents values 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from the projects are based on estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from the projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were considered appropriate for the in process research and development 
risks related to the completion of technology under development include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
write off of investment 
in march  we acquired  shares of e chemicals non voting series e preferred stock for per share 
this investment entitled us to a minority interest in e chemicals and was accounted for using the cost method 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we deemed our investment in the stock of e chemicals to be worthless and this investment of million was written off 
income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments 
income on equity in joint ventures and realized gain on sales of investments was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  this primarily consisted of  of realized gains on the partial sale of two investments and  of income on equity in joint ventures 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was calculated as a percentage of income or loss before taxes 
the effective tax rate for each of fiscal and was 
quarterly results our operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for our software products are substantial and the implementation of our solutions often requires the services of our engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenues are difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses  including license renewals  in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future

in addition  decreases to accounts receivable and installments receivable  and increases to accounts payable and accrued expenses offset the net loss

in fiscal and  investing activities used million and million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash primarily as a result of the issuance of series b convertible preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
in fiscal and  financing activities provided million and million of cash  respectively 
historically  we had financed our operations principally through cash generated from public offerings of our convertible debentures and common stock  however  during fiscal  these sources were replaced with private offerings of our series b convertible preferred stock and common stock  operating activities  and the sale of installment contracts to third parties 
in february and march  we issued and sold  shares of series b i convertible preferred stock and  shares of series b ii convertible preferred stock  together with warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our net proceeds from these transactions were million  after deducting the placement agent fee and our other expenses in connection with the placement 
the series b preferred stock accrues dividends at an annual rate of that is payable quarterly  commencing june   in either cash or common stock  at our option subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions set forth in our charter 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to the stated value  which initially is  divided by a conversion price of and for the series b i and series b ii preferred stock  respectively  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
as a result  the shares of series b preferred stock initially were convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock 
the series b preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption on february   to be paid in cash  stock or both  at our option 
in may  we issued and sold  shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
our net proceeds from this transaction were million 
we issued warrants with five year lives to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock at a price of per share and also issued a second class of warrants that entitled the investors to purchase  on or prior to july   up to  shares of common stock at a price of  together with five year warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of 
the second class of warrants expired unexercised 
historically  we have had arrangements to sell long term contracts to two financial institutions  general electric capital corporation and fleet business credit corporation formerly sanwa business credit corporation 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
during fiscal  installment contracts increased by million to million  net of million of installment contracts sold to general electric credit corporation and fleet business credit corporation 
included in this net increase is the addition of million of installments receivable in connection with the acquisition of hyprotech 
during fiscal  installment contracts increased by million to million  net of million of installment contracts sold to general electric capital corporation and fleet business credit corporation 
included in this net increase is the addition of million of installments receivable in connection with the acquisition of icarus 
during fiscal  installment contracts decreased by million to million  net of million of installment contracts sold to general electric capital corporation and fleet business credit corporation 
our arrangements with these two financial institutions provide for the sale of installment contracts up to a maximum of million  subject to approval by the institutions  having certain recourse obligations 
at june  and june   the balance of the uncollected principal portion of the contracts sold to these two financial institutions was million and million  respectively  for which we had partial recourse obligations of million and million  respectively 
the availability under these arrangements will increase as the financial institutions receive payment on installment contracts previously sold 
we maintain a million secured bank line of credit  expiring december   that provides for borrowings of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible current installment contracts 
advances under the line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate at june  or  at our option  a rate equal to a defined libor at june  plus a specified margin 

table of contents any borrowings under the line of credit must be secured by a pledge of short term investments or cash  and as a result  this line of credit does not increase the amount of net cash available to us during the term of the facility 
the line of credit agreement requires us to provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and to comply with certain financial tests  including maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated net worth and of the ratio of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and current portion of our long term installments receivable to current liabilities 
as of june   we were not in compliance with certain of the above mentioned covenants 
subsequently  we received a waiver for such non compliance  covering the period from june  to december  at june   there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
we are currently in negotiations to either i extend this line of credit with our current lender and amend the terms of the facility so that a pledge of short term investment or cash are not required to secure borrowings  or ii obtain a facility from another lender 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as short term investments totaling million 
our commitments as of june  consisted primarily of leases on our headquarters and other facilities  as well as capital leases for software and equipment 
other than these  there were no other material commitments for capital or other expenditures 
our obligations related to these leases at june  are as follows in thousands thereafter non cancellable leases we believe our current cash balances  availability of sales of our installment contracts and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
in addition  we may seek to take advantage of favorable market conditions by raising additional funds from time to time through public or private security offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results

the revaluation of accounts receivable at our foreign locations and at hyprotech for the month of june  that were denominated in currencies other than the local currencies  resulted in net losses totaling million in fiscal these losses were partially offset by the revaluation of two short term loans from our us headquarters to our foreign subsidiaries that were denominated in foreign currencies 
these two loans were issued in may  and were revalued as of june   resulting in an aggregate gain of million
