item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations through december   the company operated in three segments as follows front end semiconductor equipment and services  precision equipment  and semiconductor products and processes 
subsequent to december   the company decided to discontinue and sell its standard semiconductor products business and shift more of its resources to accelerate the market entry of its x ray lithography products 
this portion of jmar semiconductor inc s jsi business has been a developmental effort  involving the design  manufacture and introduction of new standard product semiconductor chips 
with the severe downturn in the worldwide semiconductor market  jsi has had little success in selling its new standard product chips to date 
these products would require substantial additional capital to become established in the market  as well as to develop newer  higher value chips 
the company has concluded that it will not continue to invest its resources in this business 
as a result of this decision  in the future the company will operate in two segments  the front end semiconductor equipment and services segment and the precision equipment segment 
the standard semiconductor products business will be reflected in future financial statements as a discontinued operation and the remainder of jsi s business included in the semiconductor products and processes segment will be included in the front end semiconductor equipment and services segment 
results of consolidated operations net loss for each of the fiscal years ended december   and was   and  respectively  while loss from operations for those same periods was   and  respectively 
total revenues for  and were   and  respectively 
contract revenues for  and were   and  respectively 
included in the net loss for the years ended december   and are asset writedowns and special items of   and  respectively 
see below for a detailed discussion of the asset writedowns and special items 
the decrease in total revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was attributable to an approximately million drop in sales of the company s precision instrument products as a result of the severe economic downturn which has caused our target customers to curtail capital equipment purchases 
in addition  as a consequence of the september  terrorist attacks in the us  this slowing of economic activity became worse  resulting in a further retrenchment of overall spending by our target customers 
the decrease in revenues was also attributable to a decrease in semiconductor process technology services sales of approximately  due to the company s reassignment at jsi of certain semiconductor engineering resources from external contract revenue microchip development projects to internally funded chip development and marketing activities 
the decreases in revenues for compared to were offset in part by a significant increase in x ray lithography contract revenues of  as well as other contract revenues from jmar sal nanolithography  inc jsal of  acquired in august in  the semiconductor process technology services business recorded significant revenue compared to attributable to non recurring subcontracts related to construction of a semiconductor fabrication facility for the defense microelectronics activity located in sacramento  california 
furthermore  the fiscal revenues of this business were affected by the planned reassignment of a substantial portion of the company s semiconductor engineering staff from government funded contract chip development work to internally funded commercial product development and marketing activities consistent with the company s plans to accelerate its entry into the commercial telecom semiconductor product market 
the company s ability to forecast orders for its precision instrument products continues to be limited due to continuing marketplace uncertainties which often impedes customers abilities to accurately forecast their needs 
as a result  the timing of receipt and shipment of orders could have a material impact on quarterly results in total gross margins for the fiscal years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
gross margin loss for product sales for the three years ended december   and were  and  respectively  and gross margins for contract sales for those three years were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the gross margin for product sales in was due primarily to underutilized manufacturing capacity  competitive 
table of contents pressures on product pricing and the need to increase inventory reserves to address the risks of excess quantities of materials held as a result of slow demand million increase in  including million in the fourth quarter  compared to a  increase in 
the higher total gross margins for compared to are primarily due to a change in the mix of revenue sources wherein revenue had a smaller amount of lower margin contract revenues of the semiconductor process technology services business compared to also included in is a charge to cost of sales to increase the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of  at jpsi 
the company continues to experience competitive pressures on certain precision instrument products  which may impact gross margins in the future 
the company expects that as its patented  laser driven advanced light products enter the marketplace and gain acceptance  they will substantially improve gross profit margins 
the company is currently integrating its x ray source and stepper and anticipates conducting wafer exposures using this integrated system by the end of the third quarter of additional efforts are ongoing to increase the x ray power output of our x ray sources to meet commercially viable requirements for the gaas chip manufacturing industry with the expectation of receiving an order for a commercial system by the end of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in is primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs in the semiconductor products and processes segment of  due to the buildup of the sales and marketing infrastructure related to the company s market entry of its standard semiconductor products 
in addition  there were  in sg a costs in related to jsal 
these increases were offset  in part  by a reduction in sg a costs in the precision equipment segment of approximately  primarily related to the reduction in employees during in that segment and other cost cutting programs implemented during the increase in sg a expenses in compared to is primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs in the semiconductor products and processes segment 
the company s research  development and engineering program rd e consists of two types customer funded rd e us government and other companies and company funded rd e 
both types of rd e are expensed when incurred 
customer funded rd e costs incurred  included in contract costs of sales  totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in customer funded rd e expenditures for is related to an increase of approximately  in the x ray lithography program contract funding provided by the defense advanced research projects agency  most of which is directed toward development of jmar s x ray lithography source technology for the commercial semiconductor market  and contract costs of  incurred by jsal which was acquired in august these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of  related to the company s contract for the development of a unique microcircuit architecture and devices for the replacement of obsolete integrated circuits for the defense microelectronics activity 
company funded rd e costs are shown in operating expenses and totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
hence  total rd e expenditures for those three years were   and  respectively 
rd e expenditures as a percentage of sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenditures are primarily related to the continued development of point x ray sources for lithography for the semiconductor industry and other metrology applications  development of a high efficiency euv generation system for advanced semiconductor lithography  the development of new software for the company s test and measurement systems and the engineering development of higher performance test  measurement and inspection systems for the semiconductor  optical network and biomedical industries 
due to the lack of progress in selling jsi s standard semiconductor products and the additional investment required for that product line  jmar has recorded  as of december   significant write offs related to impairments in jsi s assets 
asset writedowns and special items for the year ended december  of  includes  in asset impairments at jsi   in asset writedowns related to other discontinued projects   in lease termination costs at jsi   in severance related to reductions in force and other terminations at jpsi and  in legal costs associated with several matters  all but one of which was resolved at december  the asset writedowns at jsi include  of capitalized software development costs for products that have not generated significant sales to date and are doubtful of generating future revenues   of fixed assets including outside 
table of contents purchased software for operating assets that will not be realizable as a result of no future sales   of other assets and  of inventory 
in september  jsi moved into a significantly larger facility in anticipation of realizing its growth plans 
prior to december   the company decided to sublease the facility used by jsi and move jsi into a smaller facility 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of the company accrued its expected loss under that lease 
the asset writedowns of other discontinued projects related to nrv writedowns related to demo products  where the company has put the projects on hold and  for the writedown of abandoned patent applications 
the majority of the severance amounts are related to two negotiated severance agreements  the majority of which has been paid in cash in or will be paid in cash in the balance of the severance amount is related to several reductions in force during of a total of employees 
the reductions in force represented of the work force at jpsi and were not associated with a restructuring  exit plan or business combination 
the legal costs have either been paid in cash prior to december  or have been accrued at december  and will be paid subsequently to december  the amount of the asset writedowns and special items for the quarter ended december  was  the amounts for special items in are for legal costs and severance and the amount in is for termination costs for a former employee and legal costs 
interest expense for the fiscal years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
interest expense is less for versus due to lower borrowing costs due to the reduction in prime rate in interest expense is significantly less in versus due to the repayment of the company s working capital line the line with comerica bank in late march the terms of the line are described in consolidated liquidity and financial condition  below 
the gain on sale of marketable securities of  and  for and  respectively  is related to the sale of  shares and  shares  respectively  of the company s investment in bede plc in april and december  respectively 
other income expense for includes a writedown of  of a note receivable from an officer of the company 
results of segment operations front end semiconductor equipment and services segment revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the front end semiconductor equipment and services segment increased  from  to  this increase is due to a significant increase in x ray lithography contract revenues of  as well as other contract revenues from jsal of  acquired in august  operating income of the front end semiconductor equipment and services segment for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  decreased  from income of  to income of  despite the increase in revenues in compared to  operating income decreased primarily due to asset writedowns of  and  of losses at jsal which was acquired in august precision equipment segment revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the precision equipment segment decreased  from  to  this decrease in revenues was related to the severe economic downturn which has caused companies to curtail capital equipment purchases 
in addition  as a consequence of the september  terrorist attacks in the us  this slowing of economic activity became worse  resulting in a further retrenchment of overall spending by companies 
operating loss of the precision equipment segment for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was adversely affected as well increasing  from a loss of  to a loss of  the significantly higher operating losses in versus were due to lower revenues and lower margins of certain of the company s precision instrument 
table of contents products   of asset writedowns and severance amounts and million in inventory reserves 
semiconductor products and processes segment revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the semiconductor products segment was  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in was attributable to the current worldwide economic slowdown in the semiconductor industry which delayed the planned sales buildup of the company s standard products and the reassignment of certain semiconductor engineering resources from external contract revenue microchip development projects to internally funded chip development and marketing activities 
the operating loss for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased from  to  subsequent to december   the company decided to discontinue and sell its standard semiconductor products business

in  revenues of standard semiconductor products were approximately  included in the operating loss of this segment for are  in asset impairments and  in lease termination costs 
the asset writedowns include  of capitalized software development costs for products that have not generated significant sales to date and are doubtful of generating future revenues   of fixed assets including outside purchased software for operating assets that will not be realizable as a result of no future sales   of other assets and  of inventory 
in september  jsi moved into a significantly larger facility in anticipation of realizing its growth plans 
prior to december   the company decided to sublease the facility used by jsi and move jsi into a smaller facility 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of the company accrued its expected loss under that lease 
as a result of the company s decision to discontinue and sell the semiconductor standard products business  the company may have an acceleration of the payment of liabilities  disputed liabilities may arise  and the company may incur liabilities that it otherwise would not have incurred primarily including distributor termination costs  certain vendor liabilities and employee related costs 
these amounts are estimated to be approximately  of which approximately  and approximately  was accrued at december  and  respectively  the majority of which represents advance payments for inventory by jsi s distributor 
in march  jsi had a reduction in force of employees or of its total employees 
in future financial statements  the standard semiconductor products business will be reflected as a discontinued operation and the remainder of jsi s business  which represented the majority of the revenues on and of the semiconductor products and processes segment  will be included in the front end semiconductor equipment and services segment 
consolidated liquidity and financial condition unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal years ended december  and was  and  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in unrestricted cash for resulted primarily from an increase in restricted cash of  expenditures for software development costs primarily related to the company s commercial telecom semiconductor chips at jmar semiconductor  inc jsi of  capital expenditures of  primarily related to capital expenditures for the company s commercial telecom semiconductor chips at jsi and the upgrade and replacement of computers  cash used in operations of  primarily related to operating losses exclusive of the gain on the sale of the bede stock and asset writedowns  payment for purchase price of jsal of  foundry license costs of  and mask costs of  offset in part by borrowings under the company s working capital bank line of  and proceeds from the sale of shares of the company s investment in bede of  the company s capital expenditure budget for will be substantially less than in the company s standard semiconductor products business has been a developmental effort  involving the design  manufacture and introduction of new standard product semiconductor chips

as a result of the company s decision to discontinue this business  the company may have an acceleration of the payment of liabilities  disputed liabilities may arise  and the company may incur liabilities that it otherwise would not have incurred primarily including distributor termination costs  certain vendor liabilities and employee related costs 
these amounts are expected to be approximately  of which approximately  and approximately  was accrued at december  and  respectively  the majority of which represents advance payments for inventory by jsi s distributor 
jmar s operations will continue to require the use of working capital 
working capital as of december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the company s losses  software development and other standard chip product activities  decreases in receivables and inventory  cash paid to sal shareholders as part of the purchase price and capital equipment purchases 
the working capital of the company had generally been funded through its working capital line the line with comerica bank the bank with interest at prime rate and through third party contracts 
due to the company s continued losses  in november  the bank reduced the amount of the line to million and requires a million compensating balance 
pursuant to this new line of credit  there are no financial covenants or ratios 
the line expires march  the company is pursuing alternative banking arrangements 
in march  under its universal blank shelf registration statement see below  the company sold million shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of million 
management believes that  including this financing  the company has adequate resources to fund operations and working capital requirements at least through december  however  the company has determined that it will require additional financing to complete or accelerate the development of some of its high value emerging new products  including its patented pxs point x ray sources for lithography for the semiconductor industry and other metrology applications 
in addition to the above financing needs  additional funds could be required for future acquisitions should the company elect to pursue such acquisitions 
the company believes that it has available to it several potential sources of capital including private offerings to individual investors and additional debt or equity sales in the public market as well as additional contract funding from both current and new customers for its research and development services 
the company also intends to pursue opportunities for strategic relationships  which may include additional funding  in order to accelerate the commercialization of its emerging products 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financings will be available when needed  on favorable terms  or at all 
on august   the company filed a universal blank shelf registration statement with respect to million of company securities 
the registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  the securities that may be sold under this registration statement may be common stock  preferred stock  debt or warrants 
the company may 
table of contents sell registered securities in the public market from time to time at its discretion when market conditions are favorable and at prices that will be negotiated at those times 
in connection with the sale of stock mentioned above  the company issued to the purchasers warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share  expiring in four years 
also  the company paid a placement agent a fee of of the gross proceeds  a  non accountable expense allowance and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on august   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  jmar sal nanolithography  inc subsidiary acquired the acquisition all of the outstanding equity of semiconductor advanced lithography  inc sal  a delaware corporation  in a merger of sal with and into subsidiary merger 
consideration for the merger consisted of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock  million in cash and million in notes the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a price of 
the notes are convertible by the holders at any time and the company can force conversion if the average price  as defined  of the company s common stock during any ten day trading period exceeds 
the shares issued by the company are unregistered  however  pursuant to an agreement with the sal shareholders  the company filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on november  and has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to obtain its effectiveness 
the holders have agreed to restrictions on their sale of those jmar shares to no more than of their jmar holdings in any quarter and to refrain from selling any shares for days upon notice from jmar of its intention to negotiate an underwritten public offering 
in addition  sal s former shareholders and creditors could receive as contingent earnout consideration up to  shares of the company s common stock and up to million of convertible notes upon achievement of certain technical and market milestones over the next months 
in connection with the merger  jmar agreed to provide working capital loans to sal from time to time up to a maximum of million through june  for working capital to build its x ray steppers to be integrated with jmar s x ray sources 
in  the company was awarded an additional million of contract funding for its xrl program from the us army research laboratory sponsored by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa 
in addition  in february  jmar announced the receipt of a letter of intent from the department of the army to execute a formal contract funded by darpa valued at up to million 
the contract directs jmar to proceed immediately to deliver with all diligence jmar s patented first of a kind  one nanometer point source xrl system to produce high performance semiconductor integrated circuits needed to support a wide range of critical military missions 
as with all multi year government contracts  the amount and timing of the funding of this contract are dependent upon the annual appropriation of funds by congress 
in january  the company sold the remaining  of its investment in bede plc for net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   the company had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to certain annual limitations  which expire from through to the extent the company has taxable income in the future  these carryforwards may be used by the company to reduce its cash outlay for taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses jmar s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  software development costs  intangible assets including goodwill  income taxes  litigation and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
jmar maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of jmar s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at each year end  the company prepares a report which indicates the date that each inventory part was last used 
any inventory parts that have not been used in the past two years are isolated and reviewed for possible excess and or obsolescence based on current and future requirements 
the inventory reserve is adjusted based upon that review 
in addition  any known excess and or obsolete inventory not meeting the above requirement is evaluated for inclusion in the reserve 
obsolete inventory is disposed of after a thorough investigation 
quarterly  any known excess and or obsolete inventory based on changes in the business or other factors are evaluated and the reserve adjusted accordingly 
the company s policy for the treatment of software development costs are based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product are charged to expense when incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detail program design 
thereafter  the company reports the costs at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
amortization is calculated based on the greater of the amount capitalized as a percentage of estimated revenues over the total estimated revenues for the software as a whole  or on a straight line basis  based on estimated useful life of the products 
software development costs currently being amortized are being amortized using the straight line basis over three years 
capitalization of software development costs cease when the product is available for general release to customers 
general release is typically when the product is first shipped to a distributor and available for sale 
during the year ended december   the company wrote down to fair value  of capitalized software costs related to the company s standard semiconductor products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   the company will establish reporting units and apply a two step fair value approach to evaluating goodwill impairment  using at least an annual assessment 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company evaluated goodwill impairment based on projected future cash flows 
we periodically assess the impairment of intangible and long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the asset s ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense is based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
jmar records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized based on estimates of future taxable income 
in the event the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should jmar determine that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
as of december   a net deferred asset of  is included in other non current assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents estimated amounts for litigation reserves that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities 
estimates are based upon the facts and circumstances of each case and  in part  on advice from legal counsel regarding probable outcomes  if determinable 
product revenues are generally recognized when the product is shipped and all risks of ownership have passed to the customer 
contract revenues are recognized based on the percentage of completion method wherein income is recognized pro rata over the life of the contract based on the ratio of total incurred costs to anticipated total costs of the contract 
actual costs could differ from these estimated costs 
estimated losses are fully charged to operations when identified 
the majority of the company s product sales are standard products modified as necessary to be integrated with the customer s manufacturing line while still meeting all of our published vendor specifications regarding performance 
the systems are assembled and tested by the company prior to shipment based on either customer specifications and acceptance criteria and or in house specifications and acceptance criteria 
usually  the customer s environment is no different than that at the company s facility 
large  custom systems are usually inspected  tested and accepted by the customer in the company s facility 
jmar is iso certified  which requires jmar to have implemented detailed acceptance procedures prior to product shipment  and is in compliance with those procedures 
product revenue is generally recorded at time of shipment when title is transferred assuming all applicable revenue recognition criteria are met in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sales to distributors are recorded as revenue if all revenue recognition criteria are met  including those of sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  if applicable 
generally  revenue is recorded upon shipment to distributors if there is no right of return  or returns can be estimated  and product shipped is a standard product for which the company has a history of selling 
in contrast to distributors  sales representatives are merely elements of the company s sales force 
orders are obtained by or through sales representatives  but the product is never sold to a sales representative  rather the product is sold to and shipped directly to customers and recorded as revenue at that time 
warranty reserve is recorded based on of product sales 
warranty costs are offset against the reserve 
each quarter the reserve is analyzed to ensure that it is adequate based on actual and estimated future warranty activity 
factors that may affect future results certain statements contained in this form k which are not related to historical results  including statements regarding jmar s future sales or profit growth  competitive position or products  projects or processes currently under development  the ability of the company to successfully introduce those products into the commercial marketplace or to apply those products  projects or processes to alternative applications and the availability of future bank or equity investor financing are forward looking statements that necessarily are based on certain assumptions and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future performance and results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include concentration of sales to certain markets and customers  such as the 
table of contents semiconductor industry  delays in shipments or cancellations of orders  failure of expected orders to materialize  fluctuations in margins  timing of future orders  lack of availability of critical components  customer reorganizations  failure of advanced technology and new intellectual property to perform as predicted  the failure of pending patents to be issued  uncertainties associated with the timing of the funding of government contracts  fluctuations in demand  delays in development  introduction and acceptance of new products  changing business and economic conditions in various geographic regions  technical obsolescence of existing products  technical problems in the development or modification of current products or manufacturing processes  the impact of competitive products and pricing  including the risk that the euv llc is successful in developing an acceptable next generation lithography process that becomes the process of choice for the semiconductor industry or that the semiconductor industry fails to adopt xrl as the lithography alternative  shifts in demand for the company s products  the degree of success of technology transfer eg  advanced lithography sources  etc 
to commercial products  availability of working capital to support growth  continued government funding of advanced lithography  successful integration of acquisitions  declining credit markets  other competitive factors and temporary cessation of operations at one or more of its division facilities due to natural events such as floods  earthquakes and fires 
jmar s future operating results are also dependent on its ability to develop  manufacture and market  in a timely manner  innovative products that meet customers needs and the continued growth of the semiconductor  biochip  computer disk drive and general microelectronics industries 
inherent in this process are a number of risks that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain and requires innovations that anticipate customer needs and technological trends 
after the products are developed  the company must quickly manufacture them in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand and establish the necessary sales and marketing capabilities to assure adequate and timely sales volume 
the company has made substantial progress in its pxs x ray source development program 
however  in order to prove that its technology works and to produce a completed product  the company must integrate these highly technical and complicated systems into a fully integrated prototype 
with any new technology  there is a risk that the market may not appreciate the benefits of the product 
in the gaas chip market  the company s x ray system will compete with electron beam systems  which have demonstrated performance 
furthermore  the acceptance of the company s xrl system is dependent on the demand for high speed gaas chips increasing substantially 
the company s business plan is to increase the power of its x ray sources and make other improvements to its x ray system in order to increase the throughput of its products 
in order to do so  there are several technical risks involving the improvement of collimators  x ray masks and resists that have to be overcome 
if the company achieves these improvements  its technology will have to compete with the well funded euv technology development effort for acceptance by silicon semiconductor manufacturers 
development by others of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make the company s proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
also  the development of sophisticated laser and x ray products is a lengthy and capital intensive process and is subject to unforeseen risks  delays  problems and costs 
along with some of the risks discussed in the preceding paragraph  there is no assurance that the company will market its britelight lasers as stand alone products or that  if the company should do so  they will be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  portions of the company s manufacturing operations are sometimes dependent on the ability of a targeted base of suppliers to provide core technology  sub assemblies and common manufactured parts in time to meet critical distribution and manufacturing schedules 
from time to time the company could experience constrained supply of certain component parts due to a variety of reasons  including strong demand in certain product lines as well as strong demand in the industry 
such constraints could adversely affect jmar s operating results until alternate sourcing is developed 

table of contents as is the case for a large number of california based companies  a significant portion of the company s operations are located near major earthquake faults 
the ultimate impact on the company  significant suppliers and the general infrastructure is unknown  but operating results could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake in close proximity to the company s facilities 
the company is predominantly self insured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes 
the operations of the company involve the use of substances regulated under various federal  state and international laws governing the environment 
it is the company s policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection even if not subject to regulations imposed by local governments 
the liability for environmental remediation and related costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be estimated 
environmental costs are presently not material to jmar s operations or financial position 
although jmar believes that it has the necessary product offerings and resources for continuing success  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted and may cause the company to adjust its operations 
factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the foregoing factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
the company denominates its foreign sales in us dollars and the company does not believe that foreign currency fluctuations will have a material adverse impact on its ability to compete with its domestic based competitors 
foreign currency fluctuations  however  could make the company s products less affordable in foreign markets and thus  reduce the demand for such products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the relatively small amount of investments and variable rate debt 
the company has no investments in derivative financial instruments
