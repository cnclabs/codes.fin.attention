item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a major supplier of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry 
in december  the company expanded its aviation services and related operations through its investment in bristow aviation holdings limited bristow see note j in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of this investment 
the investment in bristow was influenced by the company s belief that the globalization of helicopter operators had begun with the then recent acquisitions and consolidations completed by two of its major international competitors 
this trend has continued with the consolidation of two major international competing helicopter operators in august further consolidation is possible as operators seek to broaden their exposure to international markets in order to better serve their customers and increase their access to and influence with financial markets  insurance markets and other suppliers 
the helicopter activities of the company s air logistics subsidiaries air log and those of bristow  together with its investment in unconsolidated entities  form an operating fleet of aircraft primarily servicing the major oil and gas markets of the world 
the company also provides production management services to the domestic offshore oil and gas industry through its wholly owned subsidiary  grasso production management  inc gpm 
gpm s services include furnishing personnel  engineering  production operating services  and paramedic services and providing boat and helicopter transportation of personnel and supplies between onshore bases and offshore facilities 
the company s investment in gpm was influenced by its belief that a restructuring in the united states oil and gas industry was taking place  creating opportunities to provide production management services to both independent and major oil and gas companies as they either grow  contract or refocus their activities accordingly 
the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activity has traditionally influenced demand for the company s services 
this was clearly evident during fiscal when the oil and gas industry experienced a significant downturn 
a market over supply of oil caused prices to decline to their lowest level in over years 
this protracted decline in commodity prices resulted in oil companies canceling or deferring a significant portion of their current and planned exploration and development activities and  accordingly  reduced demand for helicopter services in certain markets and increased rate pressure from customers in other markets 
additionally  oil companies sought to lower their internal and external production costs through initiatives to reduce excess costs and make more efficient use of contracted third party services  a trend which continued into fiscal during fiscal  the member nations of opec sought to correct the over supply of oil by instituting production cuts which  along with increasing worldwide demand  drove oil prices to historically high levels 
during fiscal  natural gas prices in the united states reached historical highs due to inventory shortages 
the firming up of prices of these two commodities sparked renewed interest in exploration and development by the major oil and gas companies 
this resulted in higher levels of exploration and development activities in fiscal  which improved our revenues and corresponding profits 
these increased industry activity levels continued into fiscal  but tapered off significantly in the united states gulf of mexico due to build up of natural gas inventories and economic uncertainty stemming from the events of september  recent single digit increases in the number of drilling rigs on contract in the gulf of mexico may indicate the reversal of this downward trend  although no assurances can be given 
the company has no way of predicting the activity levels of either the oil and gas industry in general or that of its specific customers 
however  management does believe that worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas will foster continued industry commitment for new exploration and development activities and  consequently  helicopter transportation services

air log also charters helicopters to governmental entities involved in regulating offshore oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico and provides helicopter services to the alyeska pipeline in alaska 
bristow also provides search and rescue work for the british coast guard 
international s activities include air log and bristow s operations in the following countries australia  brazil  china  colombia  congo  ecuador  india  kazakhstan  macedonia  mexico  nigeria  the maldives and trinidad 
these international operations are subject to local governmental regulations and uncertainties of economic and political conditions in those areas 
international also includes air log s service agreements with  and equity interests in  entities that operate aircraft in brazil  egypt and mexico unconsolidated entities 
fiscal as compared to fiscal operating revenues from helicopter activities increased by during fiscal  with operating expenses increasing by only 
this led to an operating margin of as compared to in fiscal the improvement in margin results from increased revenue due primarily to rate increases in both the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
air log air log s flight activity for fiscal is above the level experienced in fiscal revenue for fiscal improved by from the prior year 
this larger percentage increase in revenue compared to flight activity is due primarily to rate increases averaging and which went into effect in january and june  respectively 
flight hours and revenue generated from larger  crew change aircraft in the gulf of mexico increased by and  respectively  from the prior year  while flight hours and revenue from smaller  production related aircraft increased by and  respectively 
the increase in activity from the smaller  production related aircraft is a result of management s focus on production related contract opportunities 
air log s operating margin of for fiscal compares to for the prior year and is reflective of the improvement in flight hours and the rate increases discussed above 
the rate increase of in june was the largest in air log s year history 
these rates are effective for all contracts and were phased in over several months 
a portion of the rate increase was needed to cover additional salary costs 
in light of salary increases announced by its competitors and the shrinking pool of qualified personnel  air log increased its wage rates effective july   for pilots  mechanics and other operational employees 
as a result  an additional million is reflected in salary costs for fiscal year during september  air log s fleet was grounded for three days as a result of the faa s closure of the united states airspace 
this grounding occurred on the three peak flying days of the week and management estimates that air log lost approximately  hours of flight time as a result 
air log received approximately million in january from the department of transportation as partial reimbursement for the revenues lost due to the grounding 
currently  the drilling rig utilization in the gulf of mexico is  down from a year ago 
consequently  utilization of air log s crew change fleet is at its lowest level in recent quarters  and the market for ad hoc work has diminished 
experts who analyze the industry predict that drilling activity in the gulf of mexico will increase during the next several quarters 
there can be no assurances given that this will occur  and in fact  if it does not air log will likely experience continued reduction in the demand for its services 
on january   the company received notification from the national mediation board nmb that the office and professional employees international union opeiu had filed for an election to represent the air logistics  llc mechanics and related employees 
the nmb authorized an election  which was held on march   with the majority of the mechanics voting against union representation 
on july   the international union of operating engineers iuoe was certified by the nmb as the collective bargaining representative of the air logistics of alaska  inc mechanics and related employees 
negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement are ongoing 
the company does not believe the negotiations with the iuoe will place it at a disadvantage with its competitors 
subsequent to year end  a customer accounting for approximately million of air log s revenue in fiscal notified the company of its intention to change helicopter operators 
the transition is expected to be completed within sixty days 
during fiscal this customer had aircraft on full time monthly contract crew change aircraft and smaller aircraft 
management has developed a plan to adapt for the loss of the contract  the implementation of which will depend partly on the trend in activity levels during the next sixty days 
bristow bristow s flight hours for fiscal decreased by from the prior year while revenues declined 
this net decrease in flight activity is comprised of increases in bristow s north sea market offset by declines in norway due to the deconsolidation discussed below 
the increase in north sea revenue stems from an increase in oil industry activity as well as rate increases that bristow has achieved on customer contracts both mid term and upon renewal 
additionally  the tightening of the supply of helicopters in the north sea has resulted in premium rates being charged for ad hoc flights 
the decrease in revenue from norway is due to an accounting change during the quarter ended june   whereby the results of bristow s norwegian joint venture are no longer consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the venture is instead treated as an unconsolidated entity and the investment accounted for under the cost method of accounting see notes a and c in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the company had continued to consolidate the joint venture  bristow s flight revenues would have increased by from the prior year 
bristow s operating margin improved from in fiscal to in the fiscal the improvement in margin for the year ended march  is due primarily to the activity and rate increases in the north sea as discussed above 
bristow concluded negotiations with the two unions representing its north sea workforce in november the results of the negotiations which cover the period from july through june cost an additional million during fiscal management does not believe that salary adjustments made to reflect current market levels will place it at a competitive disadvantage 
international this area saw flight hours and revenue increase during the current fiscal year by and  respectively  from the prior year 
an increase in activity was prevalent in nigeria and trinidad 
in nigeria  flight activity and revenues were up and  respectively  over the prior year due to the further development of deep water prospects 
flight activity and revenues in trinidad increased by and  respectively  over the prior year 
this increase was due to additional drilling work and a rate increase effective october fiscal as compared to fiscal operating revenues from helicopter activities increased by during fiscal  with operating expenses increasing by only 
this led to an operating margin of as compared to in fiscal much of this improvement in margin results from increased revenue attributed to the resurgence of activity in the gulf of mexico and international markets as oil companies are returning to pre fiscal exploration and development activity levels 
flight activity during the first quarter of fiscal in the gulf of mexico  north sea and certain international markets continue to show improvements  which management believes will continue throughout air log air log s flight activity for fiscal is above the level experienced in fiscal revenue for fiscal improved by from the prior year 
this larger percentage increase in revenue compared to flight activity is due primarily to a shift in the mix of aircraft generating revenues coupled with rate increases 
flight hours and revenue generated from larger  crew change aircraft in the gulf of mexico increased by and  respectively  from the prior year  while flight hours and revenue from smaller  production related aircraft increased by and  respectively 
the increase in crew change aircraft activity is due to expanded drilling programs by the oil and gas companies and correlates to the increase in drilling rigs under contract in the gulf of mexico at march  the increase in activity from the smaller  production related aircraft is due primarily to the previously announced contract for aircraft with a gulf of mexico production management company that started in october air log s operating margin of for fiscal compares to for the prior year  and is reflective of the improvement in flight hours from higher margin crew change aircraft discussed above offset by increased compensation costs 
on november   the office and professional employees international union opeiu petitioned the national mediation board nmb to conduct an election among the mechanics and related personnel employed by air logistics  llc and air logistics of alaska  inc the election for air logistics  llc was held on march  with the mechanics voting in favor of the company 
on january   the opeiu notified the company that it had begun organizing efforts with respect to the mechanics for a second time at air logistics  llc with respect to the alaska based group  the nmb dismissed the matter on january   but due to extraordinary circumstances  the nmb did accept another representation application covering the air logistics of alaska  inc mechanics and related employees 
the alaska election was held on july  with the mechanics voting in favor of the international union of operating engineers iuoe 
negotiations with the iuoe are in progress 
bristow bristow s flight hours for fiscal decreased by  from the prior year 
this net decrease in flight activity is comprised of decreases in bristow s north sea and norway markets 
the decrease in the north sea activity is related to the termination of contracts with two major customers  effective august  excluding the impact of this lost work  north sea flight hours and revenue for the remaining customer base increased by and  respectively  from the prior year as a result of increased utilization and rate increases negotiated with customers 
the north sea was more adversely affected during the prior period of low oil prices due to generally higher exploration and production costs in that area and has taken longer than other areas around the world to rebound during this cycle 
bristow s operating margin improved from in fiscal to in the fiscal profit margins improved in fiscal as fiscal included restructuring charges of million recognized in the second quarter to adjust bristow s staffing to the current volume of work  entailing a reduction in the north sea workforce by 
absent these charges  bristow s operating margin for fiscal would have been break even 
further cost reductions  including additional employee terminations  were implemented in fiscal as management worked to establish a more cost effective and competitive organization 
severance charges of million were incurred in the first quarter of fiscal related to the above mentioned employee terminations 
absent these charges  bristow s operating margin for fiscal would have been 
international this area saw flight hours and revenue increase during the current fiscal year by and  respectively  from the prior year 
an increase in activity was prevalent in brazil  mexico and nigeria 
in nigeria revenues were up over the prior year as drilling activities in nigeria continued to improve 
during march  the company s owned mexican affiliate was awarded a million three year contract to provide helicopter transportation services to the federal electric commission of mexico 
most of the aircraft needed to fulfill the contract requirements are being leased from air log 
the contract phased in over a two month period  which began march  this contract generated lease revenue of approximately million during the year 
during the year  the company imported a seventh aircraft to brazil to cover the increased ad hoc flying resulting from the international oil companies expanding into the brazilian market 
also during the current year  the company completed its investment  subject to approval by relevant government authorities  in a local brazilian operator at a cost of million 
this investment will serve to secure air log s presence in brazil and enhance the local operator s ability to do business with the international oil companies 
production management and related services gpm conducts production management and related services in the gulf of mexico for both major and independent oil companies 
gpm s services include furnishing personnel  engineering  production operating services  paramedic services  and the provision of boat and helicopter transportation of personnel and supplies between onshore bases and offshore facilities 
fiscal as compared to fiscal operating revenues for gpm decreased by during fiscal  primarily due to the loss of a contract with a major customer in may gpm s operating margin of is below the comparable in fiscal due primarily to the decrease in revenue and increased insurance costs 
fiscal as compared to fiscal operating revenues for gpm increased by during fiscal  primarily due to new contracts and an increased move toward outsourcing of production management personnel by the oil industry 
this increase continues a trend consistent with that of the company s helicopter activities and the oil service industry in general 
gpm was able to maintain its operating margin at  comparable to fiscal corporate and other corporate operating revenues are primarily generated from the intercompany leasing of aircraft to the operating segments  which eliminates in consolidation 
consolidated general and administrative costs increased by million as a result of increased activity 
these costs increased by million in fiscal as a result of increased activity and higher contributions to the management incentive plan from improved earnings 
earnings from unconsolidated entities increased in by million due primarily to fluctuations in earnings from equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
earnings from unconsolidated entities increased in by million due to fluctuations in dividends received from equity investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the improvement in dividends paid by these entities is directly attributable to the impact the oil and gas industry has had on their respective operations 
the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were  and for  and the variance between the federal statutory rate and the effective rate for these periods is due primarily to non taxable foreign source income available to reduce us taxable income 
the company s effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of foreign source income generated by the company and its ability to realize foreign tax credits 
changes in the company s operations and operating locations in the future could impact the company s effective tax rate 
on december   the company acquired of the common stock of cox  kraay associates and its wholly owned subsidiary pueblo airmotive  inc pueblo 
headquartered in tucson  arizona  pueblo is an aircraft engine and component overhaul company 
pueblo was formerly affiliated with a group of entities that the company joint ventures with in mexico 
the capabilities of and services offered by pueblo will provide the company with an in house option for the repair and overhaul of certain engine types as well as establish the company s entry into the third party market for these services 
pueblo currently has a small share of this market  generating revenues of million during its latest fiscal year 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and the results of pueblo from the date of acquisition are included in consolidated results 
the purchase price was comprised of cash of  and the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
the closing price of the stock on the date of acquisition was and has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the tangible net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
the company is in the process of obtaining information about the fair value of the tangible net assets  therefore the purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to change 
at march   the company has a million liability recorded for the defined benefit retirement plan 
during fiscal  this liability increased by million 
this liability is required to be recognized on the plan sponsor s balance sheet when the accumulated benefit obligations of the plan exceed the fair value of the plan s assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  the increase in the minimum liability is recorded through a direct charge to stockholders equity and is therefore reflected  net of tax  as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying statement of changes of stockholders investment 
the company s hull and general liability insurance program renewed on april  insurance premiums increased by approximately upon renewal due to contraction of the aviation insurance market post september   and the company s claims experience 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of march   a million decrease from march  working capital as of march  was million  a million increase from march  total debt was million as of march   a million decrease from march  cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in the current year and from to is primarily due to the improvement in earnings 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
during  the company received proceeds of million primarily from disposals of aircraft and purchased six bell s for million  seven bell s for million  four l s for million  nine ec s for million  one l for million and one augusta a for million and placed a deposit of million on an as l super puma 
subsequent to year end  the company purchased one ec for million 
these aircraft acquisitions were made with existing cash and were made to fulfill customer contract requirements 
the company has a purchase commitment to make the remaining payment of approximately million on the as l super puma at scheduled intervals before its delivery from the manufacturer in the second or third quarter of fiscal during  the company received million from four separate disposals of aircraft and purchased ten bell ls for million  two bell ls for million  seven bell bs for million  two bell s for million  three sikorsky ss for million and three bell s for million 
the majority of these aircraft purchases were made to fulfill customer contract requirements 
during  the company received proceeds of million primarily from thirteen separate disposals of aircraft 
during the same period  the company purchased seven bell s for million  four s s for million  two s s for million  five bell s for million and three super pumas for million 
cash flows used in financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in july  the board of directors reaffirmed its february authorization to repurchase up to million shares of the company s common stock in the open market or through private transactions 
the authorization has no time limit and authorizes management to make repurchases of common stock and or debt securities as they deem prudent 
as of march   bristow had a million million revolving credit facility with a united kingdom bank that is payable on demand 
as of march   bristow had million million of letters of credit utilized and no funds were drawn under this credit facility 
as of march   the company had a million unsecured working capital line of credit with a us bank that expires on august  no funds were drawn under this facility as of march  management believes that its normal operations  lines of credit and available financing will provide sufficient working capital and cash flow to meet debt service needs for the foreseeable future 
the company has the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march  millions of dollars payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiratio n per period less than over total year years years years other commercial commitments debt guarantee residual value guarantee letters of credit total commercial commitments critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon information available 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
income taxes the company has recognized foreign tax credits available to it to offset the united states income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the united states income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that is realizable  the company uses estimates of future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to the company in each statutory category 
the company periodically reassesses these estimates and records changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to the company s estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
carrying value of aircraft the company depreciates its aircraft over to years from the date the original aircraft is placed into service 
in assigning depreciable lives to its aircraft  the company has considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic factors that could impact commercial viability 
furthermore  salvage value  an amount typically expected to be recovered through sale upon aircraft retirement  ranges from to of cost 
to date  the company s experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recoverability of the carrying amount of an aircraft might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of an aircraft s carrying amount should be assessed might include i a significant decrease in the market value of an aircraft  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an aircraft and iii current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an aircraft 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that an aircraft s carrying amount may not be recoverable  the company would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the aircraft and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the aircraft  the company would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
international operations the company currently conducts helicopter operations in over countries  excluding the united states and the united kingdom 
these operations are subject to local governmental regulations and laws 
because of the impact and requirements of these local operating requirements  the company often is required to conduct business with a local national citizen in that country 
the structure of the operation will vary depending upon the local governmental requirements and the interest of the local national citizen 
the company attempts in most instances to obtain both operational and economic control over the operations 
however  this is not feasible in all instances and the level of influence and control over the operation can change due to changes in local governmental regulations or the interests of the local national citizen 
thus  management must use its judgment in determining how to account eg  consolidation  investment equity method or investment cost method for the operations in its financial statements 
the company bases its decisions on the structure of the operations and its ability to control or exercise significant influence over the operations 
these decisions require significant judgment and are subject to change based on changes in the operating structure or the interest of the local national citizen 
in addition  these foreign operating activities often present a greater degree of financial risk to the company as the operations are often conducted in countries or regions which are subject to political and economic instability 
the company will minimize its exposure in these regions through insurance on the assets physically located in the region and through the use of dollar denominated or split dollar local currency contracts 
however  there can be no assurances that the company can completely mitigate its exposure for operating in these parts of the world 
foreign currency transactions the company accounts for its operations involving foreign currencies in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
where contract negotiations allow  olog and bristow attempt to enter into contracts for foreign based helicopter services and related costs in their functional currencies to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the company s earnings 
for foreign contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar usd  the company is exposed to the impacts of exchange rate fluctuations 
bristow maintains its accounting records in its local currency  the british pound gbp  and attempts to negotiate its helicopter and other service contracts and related costs in its local currency 
the company is exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are deferred and recorded in equity as a component of other comprehensive income  primarily related to its consolidation of bristow and the related changes in exchange rates between the usd and the gbp  further  it is exposed to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded to current earnings  related to contracts for services provided and costs incurred which are denominated in currencies other than the usd and gbp 
the company currently maintains intercompany balances with and investments in certain consolidated subsidiaries  some of which are considered by management to be permanently invested  which are accounted for under sfas no 
to the extent that the company changes its consolidation policy or liquidates the related investments  amounts currently accounted for through equity as currency translation adjustments could become subject to accounting provisions under sfas no 
 which would require the recognition of such amounts in current earnings as foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
legal matters the company has received notices from the epa that it is one of approximately prps at one superfund site in texas  one of over prps at a site in louisiana and a prp at one site in rhode island 
the company believes  based on presently available information  that its potential liability for clean up and other response costs in connection with these sites is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
see item legal proceedings for additional information regarding epa notices 
recent accounting pronouncements effective april   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  that amends certain provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the pronouncements require that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the standards significantly changed the company s prior practices by i terminating the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for future business combinations  ii ceasing goodwill amortization  and iii requiring impairment testing of goodwill based on a fair value concept 
sfas no 
requires that impairment testing of the opening goodwill balances be performed within six months from the start of the fiscal year in which the standard is adopted and that any impairment be written off and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
it also requires that another impairment test be performed during the fiscal year of adoption of the standard and that impairment tests be performed at least annually thereafter  with interim testing required under certain circumstances 
any impairment charges recorded as a result of these subsequent tests will be recorded as operating expenses 
the standards must be implemented for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will cease to amortize goodwill in fiscal goodwill amortization was approximately million for each of the years ended march   and no amortization was recorded during fiscal related to the pueblo acquisition goodwill see note i 
the company has not completed its initial evaluation of goodwill impairment that is required with the adoption of the sfas no 
however  based on the preliminary evaluation procedures it has performed  the company does not believe that its existing goodwill will be impaired 
the initial transition evaluation is required to be and will be completed by september  the fasb also recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement will require the company to record the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
on april  although the company has not yet determined the transition amounts  the nature of its operations does not create significant asset retirement obligations  therefore  management does not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb additionally  certain dispositions may now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of the statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has million of debt outstanding  of which million carries a variable rate of interest 
management does not believe the remaining level of variable rate debt exposes it to a material amount of interest rate market risk 
however  the market value of the company s fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the company does not have any significant maturities of fixed rate debt occurring before fiscal the company s ability to refinance this fixed rate debt varies in response to significant changes in interest rates  among other factors 
the company does use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  the company will utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
the company has historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of certain spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
most of bristow s revenues and expenses are denominated in british pounds sterling pound 
as of march   the company did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
management does not believe that its limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk necessitates the extensive use of forward exchange contracts
