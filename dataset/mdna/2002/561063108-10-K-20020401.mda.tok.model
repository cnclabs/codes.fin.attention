impact of recently adopted accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board approved sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
as individual properties will qualify as components under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company expects the operations of all properties sold or classified as held for sale after december  to be shown as discontinued operations 
in addition  operations for such properties for all prior periods presented will be reclassified to discontinued operations 
the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations 
funds from operations management considers funds from operations ffo to be a standard supplemental measure of performance of an equity real estate investment trust 
the company uses the method of calculating ffo prescribed by the october white paper issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which utilizes net income or loss excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property  further adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation  amortization and impairment of real estate assets and including items from nonrecurring events except for those that are defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  including distributions 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or the ability to pay distributions but rather  as a supplemental tool to be used in conjunction with these factors in analyzing the company s overall performance 
the company reports ffo on both a basic and diluted basis 
the company no longer considers its convertible debentures and convertible notes to be common stock equivalents for purposes of calculating diluted ffo because management believes that conversion of these securities is remote at this time based upon the conversion price of the securities in relation to the current market price of the company s common stock 
prior years amounts have been restated to conform with the current year presentation 
the following table shows the components that comprise the company s ffo for each of the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands net income loss   depreciation of buildings and improvements    amortization of tenant allowances and improvements amortization of leasing costs gain on sale of real estate    impairment of real estate  loss on extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of change in accounting principle funds from operations  basic and diluted    weighted average shares outstanding basic    diluted    critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that require management estimates and judgment 
revenue recognition minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
the company records percentage rental revenue when lessees specified sale targets are achieved 
recoveries from tenants are recognized as revenue in the period that applicable costs are chargeable to tenants 
impairment of real estate the company reviews its properties on a quarterly basis for impairment and provides a provision if impairments are determined 
to determine if impairment may exist  the company reviews its properties and identifies those that have had either an event of change or event of circumstances warranting further assessment of recoverability 
if further assessment of recoverability is needed  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the property and its eventual disposition  on an individual property basis 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges over the company s anticipated holding period of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the property on an individual property basis  the company will recognize an impairment loss based upon the estimated fair value of such properties 
aggregate impairment losses are not reduced by unrealized appreciation of other assets

recent efforts to increase cash flow have centered on redevelopment opportunities at certain of the company s existing properties  disposition of non core assets and refinancing of unencumbered properties

inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its results from operations 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled base rent increases and ii percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise 
in addition  many of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increases in rents upon re rental at then current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and interest rate instruments 
based on the company s outstanding variable rate debt at december   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would no have no effect on the company s earnings or cash flows or the fair value of the debt outstanding at that date
