promark also faces significant competition from other gas marketers  some of whom are significantly larger in size and have greater financial resources than promark  canadian forest or forest 
regulation united states 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas  including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells and maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the abandonment of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in april  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation services separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
commencing in february  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which  among other things  i lifts the cost based cap on pipeline transportation rates in the capacity release market until september   for releases of pipeline capacity of less than one year  ii permits pipelines to charge different maximum cost based rates for peak and off peak times  iii encourages auctions for pipeline capacity  iv requires pipelines to implement imbalance management services  and v restricts the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances  overruns  and non compliance with operational flow orders 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect forest only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can we predict whether and to what extent the ferc s regulations will survive judicial review and  if so  whether the ferc s actions will achieve the stated goal of increased competition in natural gas markets 
however  we do not believe that we will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which and in which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
commencing in april  ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which imposed certain reporting requirements applicable to gas service providers operating on the ocs concerning their prices and other terms and conditions of service 
the purpose of order no 
is to provide regulators and other interested parties with sufficient information to detect and to remedy discriminatory conduct by such service providers 
ferc has stated that these reporting rules apply to ocs gatherers and has clarified that they may also apply to other ocs service providers including platform operators performing dehydration  compression  processing and related services for third parties 
the us district court recently overturned the ferc s reporting rules as exceeding its authority under ocsla 
the ferc has indicated an appeal is likely 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent these regulations might be reinstated  and what effect  if any  they may have on our financial condition or operations 
the rules  if reinstated  may increase the frequency of claims of discriminatory service  may decrease competition among ocs service providers and may lessen the willingness of ocs gathering companies to provide service on a discounted basis 
certain operations that we conduct are on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm and mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
the stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the times during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban any surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling 
lessees must also comply with detailed blm or mms regulations  as applicable  governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of ocs wells  calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and we can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the blm or mms  as applicable  may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
in march  the mms issued a final rule modifying the valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales 
when oil production sales are not in arms length transactions  the new royalty calculation will base the valuation of oil production on spot market prices instead of the posted prices that were previously utilized 
we do not believe that this rule will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress  states  the ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
we can give no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
we do not anticipate  however  that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
all current legislation is a matter of public record and we are unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be created 
in canada  oil exports are subject to regulation by the national energy board neb  an independent federal regulatory agency 
exports may be made pursuant to export orders with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years in the case of heavy crude 
natural gas exported from canada is also subject to regulation by the neb 
exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb 
natural gas exports for a term of less than two years must be made pursuant to an neb order  or  in the case of exports for a longer duration to a maximum of years pursuant to an export license from the neb with government of canada approval 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
the petroleum registry of alberta is a new initiative of both industry and the alberta government 
its purpose is to streamline data transfers between industry and government and industry to industry ie  partner to partner 
the initiative will make use of technology such as the internet to facilitate the transfer of data  reports and royalty payments 
implementation is expected to be october concurrent with the implementation of the registry  the government of alberta will be imposing a new ngl royalty system for products situated in the residue gas stream 
it is the goal of this policy to maintain royalty neutrality and as such  there should be minimal effect on canadian forest s royalties 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by forest to the provincial governments 
the trend in recent years has been for provincial governments to allow such programs to expire without renewal  and consequently few such programs are currently operative 
in alberta  certain producers of oil or natural gas are entitled to a credit against the royalties to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the credit is determined by applying a specified rate to a maximum of million cdn of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
the specified rate is a function of the royalty tax credit reference price rtcrp which is set quarterly by the alberta department of energy and ranges from to  depending on oil and gas par prices for the previous calendar quarter 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control that occurred when canadian forest was acquired by forest 
crown royalties on production from producing properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible 
canadian forest has drilled several wells in the foothills areas  which qualify for the alberta deep gas royalty holiday program 
wells qualify at a depth drilled in excess of meters 
canadian forest is in receipt of credits from this program and will continue to monitor receipts for the remaining wells 
regulation in northwest territories of canada 
the provincial governments have jurisdiction over the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the provinces of canada and the federal government has jurisdiction over the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the canadian territories 
the yukon  northwest territories and nunavut governments recently signed a northern cooperation accord for the purpose of cooperating to seek jurisdiction over the oil and gas resources in these territories 
if jurisdiction over the oil and gas resources in these territories were to be transferred to the territorial governments  the territorial governments would have the authority to regulate the grant of drilling permits  the construction of pipelines and other matters affecting oil and gas exploration and development activities 
we are unable to predict whether any transfer of jurisdiction to the territorial governments would affect our exploration and development activities in the northwest territories  although it is possible that the territorial governments would adopt policies or regulations that could delay or limit our proposed exploration and development activities  delay or prevent the construction of pipelines or result in the payment of higher royalties or taxes than would otherwise be the case under the current federal regulatory framework 
as a result of canadian forest s activity in the northwest territories  a large royalty tax credit has been accumulated to the extent of qualified capital expenditures 
this credit can be used to eliminate royalties on existing and future producing wells 
canadian forest s right to produce oil and gas from its northwest territories properties  along with the production rights of other industry participants in these properties  is subject to finalizing the commercial discovery licenses and production licenses for the wells to be produced 
until the particulars for these licenses and the related spacing units are finalized  canadian forest s share of production cannot be finally determined 
north american free trade agreement 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use based upon the proportion prevailing in the most recent month period  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  or iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
environmental matters 
extensive us federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies  such as the us environmental protection agency commonly called the epa issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply 
these laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
this regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations or earnings  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future 
the oil pollution act of opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a pipeline  vessel or onshore facility  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages from oil spills 
opa also requires operators of offshore ocs facilities to demonstrate to the mms that they possess at least million in financial resources that are available to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
this financial responsibility amount can increase up to a maximum of million if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at a facility exceeds applicable threshold volumes established by the mms under rules it issued in august pertaining to offshore facilities covered by opa 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
the us water pollution control act commonly called the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes in navigable waters 
many state discharge regulations and the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system generally prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into coastal waters 
although the costs to comply with these zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant  the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 
forest generates wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act  as amended commonly referred to as rcra and comparable state statutes 
the epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
moreover  certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes generated by forest that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous waste may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended commonly called cercla but also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner and operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances that have been released at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
in the ordinary course of forest s operations  substances may be generated that fall within the definition of hazardous substances 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
moreover  we may own or operate properties that in the past were operated by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
those properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to remediate such properties 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
in alberta  environmental compliance has been governed by the alberta environmental protection and enhancement act aepea since september  in addition to replacing a variety of older statutes which related to environmental matters  aepea also imposes certain environmental responsibilities on oil and natural gas operators in alberta and in certain instances also imposes greater penalties for violations 
british columbia s environmental assessment act became effective june  this legislation rolls the previous processes for the review of major energy projects into a single environmental assessment process which contemplates public participation in the environmental review 
although we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to fully cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant environmental related event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
we have established guidelines to be followed to comply with us and canadian environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  we have designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on forest and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
we also employ an environmental director whose responsibilities include causing our operations to be carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and implementing adequate safety precautions 
although we maintain pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards 
we are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures as a result of increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment 
forward looking statements the information in this form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts  that address activities  events  outcomes and other matters that forest plans  expects  intends  assumes  believes  budgets  predicts  forecasts  projects  estimates or anticipates and other similar expressions will  should or may occur in the future are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on management s current belief  based on currently available information  as to the outcome and timing of future events 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k  in part ii  item under the caption risk factors 
forward looking statements appear in a number of places and include statements with respect to  among other things estimates of our future natural gas and liquids production  including estimates of any increases in oil and gas production  planned capital expenditures and availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  our outlook on oil and gas prices  estimates of our oil and gas reserves  the impact of political and regulatory developments  our future financial condition or results of operations and our future revenues and expenses  and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
we caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of oil and gas 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in part ii  item under the caption risk factors 
the financial results of our foreign operations are also subject to currency exchange rate risks 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of such data by our reservoir engineers 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements express or implied  included in this form k and attributable to forest are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
this cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that forest or persons acting on its behalf may issue 
forest does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission  except as required by law

undeveloped acres are considered to be those acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or natural gas  regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
it should not be confused with undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of a lease 
a gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned

a net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional ownership working interests in gross acres equals one 
the number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof 
undeveloped acreage decreased at december  compared to december  primarily as a result of the sale of interests in tunisia and australia

while we believe that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to our consolidated financial position  the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow in the reporting periods in which any such actions are resolved 
on december   forest completed a merger transaction with forcenergy inc  in which forest was the surviving company 
prior to the merger with forest  forcenergy was a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the normal course of its business 
on march   forcenergy and its wholly owned subsidiary  forcenergy resources inc  filed voluntarily under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
forcenergy continued to operate as a debtor in possession subject to the bankruptcy court s supervision and orders until its plan of reorganization which was confirmed on january  became effective on february  obligations of forcenergy arising out of activities prior to march   the bankruptcy petition date  will be discharged in accordance with the plan of reorganization 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization  forcenergy established a reserve of forcenergy common stock to be distributed to claimants in the event their disputed claims are ultimately determined by the bankruptcy court to be allowed claims 
the reserved shares of forcenergy common stock became forest common shares in accordance with the terms of the merger 
if the shares in the reserve are inadequate to cover all allowed claims  then under the forcenergy plan of reorganization forest would be required to issue additional shares of common stock to the holders of these claims 
forest currently believes  however  that the shares in the reserve are adequate to cover all remaining disputed claims that may be subsequently allowed 
we cannot give assurances  however  that this will be the case

under this method of accounting  the recorded assets and liabilities of forest and forcenergy were carried forward to the combined company at their recorded amounts  and income of the combined company includes income of forest and forcenergy for the entire year 
the results of operations of forcenergy prior to december   the effective date of its reorganization and fresh start reporting  are not included in the financial statements of the combined company 
results of operations net earnings for were  compared to net earnings of  in the decrease in earnings was due primarily to higher deferred income tax expense in in  the income tax expense was lower due to a credit for previously unrecognized deferred tax assets 
earnings before income taxes were higher in than in as a result of higher product prices  offset partially by higher operating expense and lower production volumes 
net earnings for were  compared to net earnings of  in the improvement in earnings was due primarily to higher production volumes resulting from the merger with forcenergy and higher product prices 
marketing and processing revenue increased by to  in from  in and the related marketing and processing expense increased by to  in from  in the previous year 
the earnings contribution reported for marketing and processing activities increased to  in from  in the increase is due primarily to an increase in volumes marketed by promark in as well as higher margins on arrangements where the margin was determined on a percentage of natural gas prices 
marketing and processing revenue increased by to  in from  in  and the related marketing and processing expense increased by to  in from  in the previous year 
the gross margin for marketing and processing activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease in the margin was due primarily to lower margins on processing activities in the united states

hedged oil and condensate volumes were  barrels   barrels and  barrels in  and  respectively 
the aggregate net realized gains losses under energy swap agreements were   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and and were accounted for as increases reductions to oil and gas sales 
we also realized a gain of  in related to derivative instruments that did not qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
adopted january  this gain was recorded as other income rather than oil and gas revenue and has not been given effect in the average sales prices shown below 
general and administrative expense decreased to  in compared to  in general and administrative expense was 
per mcfe and 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate for the year was due primarily to operating synergies associated with the merger with forcenergy  as well as higher recoveries of overhead related to exploration and development activities and production operations 
general and administrative expense increased to  in compared to  in general and administrative expense was

the increase in the rate was due primarily to general and administrative expenses related to forcenergy operations in total overhead costs decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease in was due to operating synergies and higher overhead recoveries  the increase in compared to was due primarily to addition of forcenergy operations 
the amount of overhead capitalized increased to of total overhead in compared to in and the increase in the capitalization rate in was due primarily to an increase in the relative numbers of exploration and development personnel compared to administrative personnel following the merger with forcenergy 
the following table summarizes total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  in thousands overhead costs capitalized    general and administrative costs expensed    total overhead costs    number of salaried employees at end of year includes   and  in  and  respectively  related to marketing and processing operations 
merger and seismic licensing costs of  in and  in include banking  legal  accounting  printing and other consulting costs related to the merger  severance paid to terminated employees  expenses for office closures  employee relocation  data migration and systems integration  and costs of transferring seismic licenses from forcenergy to forest 
depreciation and depletion expense increased to  in from  in due primarily to a higher per unit rate 
the depletion rate increased to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  due primarily to capital spending and higher estimates for future development costs during the first nine months of  offset partially by a reduction in future development costs  credits to the full cost pool for property sales and increases in estimated proved reserves in the last three months of depreciation and depletion expense increased to  in from  in due primarily to increased production as a result of the merger with forcenergy and an increased per unit rate 
the depletion rate increased to per mcfe in compared to 
per mcfe in  due primarily to higher finding costs in and higher estimated future development costs in the inflationary environment for oilfield services at that time 
at december  forest had the following costs of undeveloped properties which were not subject to depletion united states canada international total in thousands the decrease during compared to was due primarily to wells in progress in alaska at december  for which reserves were recorded in  offset partially by costs incurred for wells in progress and lease acquisitions in canada and exploration activities in south africa 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to wells in progress in alaska and exploration activities in south africa  offset partially by surrendered and abandoned leases in the united states and canada 
in  forest recorded an impairment of international oil and gas properties of  of this amount  approximately  related to an unsuccessful well in albania 
impairments were also recognized in other countries based on expiration of certain concessions and evaluations of the viability of projects in those countries 
in  forest recorded an impairment of  related to unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled in switzerland and thailand 
writedowns of the full cost pools in the united states and canada may be required if oil and gas prices decline  undeveloped property values decrease  estimated proved reserve volumes are revised downward or estimated future development costs in the respective full cost pools increase such that the book values of our properties exceed the discounted future net cash flows from the reserves attributable to each of the cost pools 
additional impairments of international oil and gas properties may also be required in the future 
there was an impairment of contract value of  in related to the netback pool administered by promark 
the unamortized portion of the contract values recorded in the acquisition of promark were reduced to more closely match the remaining cash flows 
other expense of  in consisted primarily of a reserve of  for of receivables due from enron for physical sales of natural gas 
other income of  in consisted primarily of interest income earned by forcenergy 
other income of  in consisted primarily of a gain from the sale of gas processing facilities in canada 
interest expense of  in decreased  or compared to due to lower average debt balances  lower rates on variable and fixed rate debt and a net gain of  recognized under interest rate swap agreements 
interest expense of  in increased  or compared to due primarily to the merger with forcenergy 
foreign currency translation gains losses were  in   in and  in foreign currency translation gains and losses relate to translation by canadian forest of the senior subordinated notes  and are attributable to the increases and decreases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the period 
the value of the canadian dollar was 
per us at december  compared to 
at december   
at december  and 
at december  forest is required to recognize the noncash foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the senior subordinated notes because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of canadian forest is the canadian dollar 
the realized gain on oil and gas derivative instruments of  in was due primarily to oil and natural gas prices being  in the aggregate  lower than the prices established in the related derivative contracts 
this gain was partially offset by a  writeoff of of the asset value of derivative contracts where enron was the counterparty 
there was a net unrealized gain on derivative instruments of  in representing primarily the excess of the fair value over the intrinsic value of options designated as hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments were recorded separately in non operating income since the instruments do not qualify as hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which forest adopted on january  forest recorded current income tax expense of  in compared to current tax expense of  in and a current tax benefit of  in the increases in and are due primarily to increased pre tax profitability and higher state tax provisions 
deferred income tax expense was  in compared to  in and  in the increase in was due primarily to increased pre tax profitability and to the recognition in of the future income tax benefit of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to increased pre tax profitability 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in resulted from the redemption of  and  principal amount of and senior subordinated notes  respectively  at and of par value  respectively 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in resulted from redemption of  remaining principal amount of senior subordinated notes at of par value 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit  and through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of forest  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
securities issued 
in june  we issued  principal amount of senior notes due at par for proceeds of  net of related issuance costs 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our us credit facility 
in october  we issued an additional  principal amount of senior notes due at of par for proceeds of  net of related issuance costs 
the net proceeds were initially used to repay a portion of our us credit facility 
subsequently  borrowings were made under the us credit facility to repurchase approximately  principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
in december  we issued  principal amount of senior notes due at par for proceeds of  net of related issuance costs 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our us credit facility  to repurchase approximately  principal amount of our senior subordinated notes and for general corporate purposes 
securities repurchased 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share   principal amount of senior subordinated notes and  principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
bank credit facilities 
we have credit facilities totalling  consisting of a  us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and a  canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan bank canada 
under the credit facilities  forest  canadian forest and certain of their subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants and financial tests  including restrictions or requirements with respect to dividends  additional debt  liens  asset sales  investments  hedging activities  mergers and reporting responsibilities 
as of december   under the most restrictive of these covenants and financial tests  our available borrowing amount under the credit facilities was estimated to be approximately  if the rating on our bank credit facilities is downgraded  the available borrowing amount under the credit facilities would be determined by a borrowing base subject to semi annual re determination 
reduction of the borrowing base could result in a substantial reduction in the available borrowing amount 
in addition  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
our us credit facility is secured by a lien on  and a security interest in  a portion of our proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the united states and canada  a pledge of of the capital stock of canadian forest and its parent  canada ltd  and a pledge of of the capital stock of forest pipeline company 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under the us credit facility were  and there were no outstanding borrowings under the canadian forest credit facility 
at march   the outstanding borrowings under the us credit facility were  with an average effective interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings under the canadian credit facility of  with an average effective interest rate of 
at march   forest had used the credit facilities for letters of credit in the amount of  us and  cdn 
credit ratings 
currently  our credit facilities  our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies  moody s investor services and standard poor s s p s 
in addition  s ps has assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the rating agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure  and our general financial condition and prospects 
our credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit rating 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit rating 
for example  if our credit rating is downgraded from its current level  we will be subject to tests to determine our borrowing base and the amount of credit that is available 
the agreements governing our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes do not include adverse triggers that are tied to our credit rating 
the terms of our senior notes include provisions that will allow us greater flexibility if the credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied 
in this event  we would have no further obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of such financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands long term debt    operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    obligations related to international concessions   total contractual obligations     long term debt consists of our us and canadian lines of credit  subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
for a more detail discussion of our long term debt  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consists primarily of leases for office space 
consists primarily of firm commitments for gathering  processing and pipeline capacity 
commitments in areas that have secondary markets may be mitigated in the future if firm capacities are no longer required 
promark  on behalf of the promark netback pool  has firm commitments for pipeline capacity of approximately  canadian forest  as one of the producers in the promark netback pool  supplied of the gas to the promark netback pool in purchase commitments associated with promark s trading activities were excluded from the table as all purchase commitments are immediately offset by sales commitments 
for a more detailed discussion of promark s trading activities  see part ii  item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consists of unconditional obligations under work programs in albania and gabon 
in addition to these unconditional obligations  we are committed to make  of capital expenditures over the next six years pursuant to the terms of other foreign concessions 
nonperformance under any concession agreement could result in the loss of concession rights 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through  totaled  as of december  commercial commitments 
guarantees 
we hold a equity interest in an affiliate that owns and operates a petroleum pipeline system within the cook inlet area of alaska 
in our capacity as a shareholder  we have provided a guarantee for our proportionate interest of the obligations of this affiliate under a credit facility 
at december   the maximum amount available under the credit facility was  and  was outstanding 
our proportionate share of the amount outstanding was  this credit facility will expire in january in addition  in our capacity as a shareholder  we may have other contingent obligations in the event the affiliate experiences cash deficiencies or is unable to meet its indemnification requirements or its obligations to the operator of the pipeline 
we are unable to predict or quantify the amount of these obligations 
surety bonds 
in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we have obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately  in connection with their administration of offshore leases in the gulf of mexico  the mms annually evaluates each lessee s plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the mms reviews this information and applies certain financial tests including  but not limited to  current asset and net worth tests 
the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
we annually provide the mms with our financial information 
if we do not satisfy the mms requirements  we could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  forest has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
we cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto  but the amount could be substantial 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
it is normal for forest to report working capital deficits at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits are principally the result of accounts payable for capitalized exploration and development costs 
settlement of these payables is funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by drawdowns on long term bank credit facilities 
for cash management purposes  drawdowns on the credit facilities are not made until the due dates of the payables 
forest had a working capital deficit of approximately  at december  compared to a deficit of approximately  at december  the increase in the deficit was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of lower oil and gas prices  offset partially by an increase in other short term assets  primarily derivative instruments 
cash flow 
historically  one of our primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in the increase was due primarily to higher production revenue as a result of higher oil and gas prices 
cash used for investing activities in was  compared to  in the increase was due primarily to increased exploration and development activity in  offset partially by an increase in property sales in net cash used by financing activities in was  compared to  in the period included net repayments of bank debt of  cash used for redemption of senior subordinated notes of  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of  and net cash inflows of  from the issuance of two series of senior notes 
the period included net repayments of bank debt of  and net proceeds of  from forcenergy s issuance of series a cumulative preferred stock 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in compared to  in the period included higher production revenue due to higher oil and gas prices and increased production due primarily to the merger with forcenergy 
we used  for investing activities in compared to  in the increase was due primarily to higher exploration and development expenditures in as a result of the merger with forcenergy 
cash used by financing activities in was  compared to cash provided of  in the period included net repayments of bank debt of  offset partially by net proceeds of  from forcenergy s issuance of series a cumulative preferred stock 
the period included net proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes  net proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock  and  of cash attributable to fresh start accounting of forcenergy  offset by net repayments of bank borrowings of  capital expenditures 
expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development for the past three years were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties   undeveloped properties   exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    basis of forcenergy properties acquired total capital expenditures    forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are approximately  to  we intend to meet our capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of non strategic assets and  if necessary  borrowings under existing lines of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient capital to meet these capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if we experience lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or develop other needs for liquidity  or could be increased if we experience increased cash flow or access additional sources of capital 
in addition  while we intend to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that we can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
dispositions of assets 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we routinely dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with marginal value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
at the present time  forest is offering for sale certain marginal properties in each of our operating regions 
during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  of this amount  approximately  related to properties located in the offshore gulf of mexico area in which we sold of our interests to unocal in connection with a strategic joint venture program 
during  forest disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  also during  we disposed of gas processing facilities for net proceeds of  and disposed of a long term investment for net proceeds of  impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
during  the financial accounting standards board issued four new pronouncements statement  business combinations  requires that the purchase method of accounting be used to account for all business combinations and applies to all business combinations initiated or completed after june  the statement also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the provisions of this statement would be applied if we were to enter into any future business combination 
the adoption of this statement as of july  had no impact on our historical financial statements 
statement  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but tested for impairment at least annually 
other intangible assets are to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life will not be amortized until its useful life becomes determinable 
the effective date of this statement is january  the impact of the adoption and implementation of sfas no 
on forest s financial statements has not been determined  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of january   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  that will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
we currently record estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and similar activities as part of our provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and gas properties without recording a separate liability for such amounts 
we have not completed our assessment of the impact of sfas no 
on our financial condition and results of operations  but expect that adoption of the statement will result in increases in the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and in the recognition of additional liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses while resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
sfas no 
also expands the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  regarding presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement 
the scope for reporting a discontinued operation has been expanded to include a component of an entity 
a component comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity 
it could be a segment  a reporting unit  a consolidated subsidiary  or an asset group 
forest adopted sfas no 
as of january  because we have elected the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities  the impairment provisions of sfas no 
do not apply to our oil and gas assets  which are instead subject to ceiling limitations 
for our non oil and gas assets  the method of impairment assessment is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements

in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating forest 
oil and gas price declines and their volatility could adversely affect forest s revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
forest s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
increases and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that forest can produce economically 
any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports  or general economic conditions 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas  we enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of one year or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the arrangements 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
for example  a subsidiary of enron corp 
that is a counterparty on several of our derivative contracts filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in december we have fully impaired the million value of the related derivative asset at december  we cannot give any assurance as to whether we will be able to collect any amounts due us on such contracts 
in addition  we may continue to be liable for payments of any amounts which may become due to the counterparty and its affiliates that are parties to such contracts  regardless of the bankruptcy proceeding 
we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
for further information concerning prices  market conditions and energy swap and collar agreements  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk of this form k  and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain parties with whom we have long term and short term contracts may fail to perform 
we have long term and short term contracts  including agreements for the sale of oil and natural gas 
the other parties to these contracts could fail to perform their contractual obligations as a result of circumstances that are beyond our control 
our ability to enforce these contractual obligations may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and other creditors rights laws 
for example  in we sold natural gas to a subsidiary of enron corp 
that filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
this sale was on a month to month basis 
we have fully reserved the amounts due to us under the enron contracts and  because of the bankruptcy  cannot give any assurance as to whether we will be able to collect the amounts due 
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing to execute our operating strategy 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the use of bank credit facilities  the issuance of debt and equity securities and the use of cash provided by operating activities 
we continue to examine the following alternative sources of long term capital bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  the issuance of nonrecourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  sales of prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices and the value and performance of forest 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we spend and will continue to spend a substantial amount of capital for the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas reserves 
our capital expenditures during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we expect our total capital expenditures in to be at least million 
if low oil and natural gas prices  drilling or production delays  operating difficulties or other factors  many of which are beyond our control  cause our revenues and cash flows from operations to decrease  we may be limited in our ability to spend the capital necessary to complete our drilling and development program 
in addition  if our borrowing base under our credit facility is redetermined to a lower amount  this could adversely affect our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures 
after utilizing our available sources of financing  we may be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such expenditures 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
a curtailment of capital spending could adversely affect our ability to replace production and our future cash flow from operations 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in certain situations  hydrocarbon reservoirs underlying our properties may extend beyond the boundaries of our own acreage to adjacent acreage owned by others 
in this case  our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by the operators on those adjacent properties 
also  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped compared to at december  the increase in the percentage of undeveloped reserves is attributable primarily to our discovery at redoubt shoal  alaska 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
in estimating our proved reserves we have assumed that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in this form k is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor for forest 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with forest or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor 
leverage will materially affect our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was approximately million  including approximately million outstanding under our global bank credit facilities with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and jp morgan bank canada 
our long term debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds  to dispose of assets  or to pay dividends  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the agreements governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default including an event of default under other agreements or a change of control 
in addition  we may alter our capitalization significantly in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may increase our level of debt significantly 
a high level of debt increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations  our future performance and our ability to raise additional capital 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of any equity offering 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future debt or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
in addition  if our bank credit facility rating is downgraded  our ability to borrow under our credit facilities would be subject to a borrowing base that would re determined semi annually 
if  following such a re determination  our outstanding borrowings exceeded the amount of the re determined borrowing base  we would be forced to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings in excess of the re determined borrowing base 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we are not able to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or to arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  our credit ratings and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling test writedown 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values  if estimated future development costs increase or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test writedowns in the future 
we may incur significant abandonment costs or be required to post substantial performance bonds in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells  platforms and pipelines 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on our oil and gas properties  pro rata to our working interest 
we provide for expected future abandonment liabilities by accruing for such costs as a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization as production occurs 
we also account for these future liabilities by including all projected abandonment costs as a reduction in the future cash flows from our reserves in our reserve reporting 
as of december   total undiscounted future abandonment costs were estimated to be approximately million  primarily for properties in offshore gulf of mexico and alaska waters 
approximately million in abandonment costs are anticipated to be incurred in  all of which are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
estimates of abandonment costs and their timing may change due to many factors  including actual drilling and production results  inflation rates  changes in abandonment techniques and technology  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
gulf of mexico reservoirs experience steep declines  while the declines in long lived fields in other regions are relatively slow 
production from gulf of mexico reservoirs represented approximately of our total production in our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
forest s future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  geological pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in experienced labor  and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
our redoubt shoal prospect in alaska is an important property on which we have spent and have budgeted to spend substantial amounts 
our discovery at redoubt shoal in the cook inlet of alaska is an important property on which we have recorded mmbbls of estimated proved reserves and where we expect to spend substantial amounts in to bring the discovery on production 
in order to complete the construction of our facilities and conduct ongoing operations in the cook inlet area  we will need to obtain various federal and state governmental approvals  permits and licenses and enter into agreements with individual landowners 
we cannot control the timing or the issuance of these approvals  and there also exists the possibility that a third party will commence a legal challenge to such approvals and permits 
we may encounter difficulties commencing production 
once production begins  it will be through a single production facility 
since a significant portion of our oil recovery at redoubt shoal will come from a secondary recovery water injection program  there is risk that ultimate recovery will vary from our estimates based on the performance of the water injection program 
in addition  the area in which we operate in alaska may experience volcanic activity  tremors and earthquakes 
depending on the severity of these types of disturbances  they could cause substantial damage to our facilities and interrupt production 
a delay in the commencement of production or curtailment of production for a significant period of time could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may be restrained in our ability to market production due to the availability  proximity and capacity limits of pipelines 
our industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas involves risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
for example  a substantial portion of our oil and gas operations is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the gulf of mexico area experiences tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the profitability of our gas marketing activities may be limited 
our operations include gas marketing through our subsidiary  promark 
promark s gas marketing operations consist of the marketing of gas production in canada  the purchase and direct sale of third parties natural gas  the handling of transportation and operations of third party gas and spot purchasing and selling of natural gas 
the profitability of such natural gas marketing operations depends on our ability to assess and respond to changing market conditions  including credit risk 
profitability also depends on our ability to maximize the volume of third party natural gas that we purchase and resell or exchange and to obtain a satisfactory fee for service or margin between the negotiated purchase price and the sales price for such volumes 
if we are unable to respond accurately to changing conditions in the gas marketing business  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
promark does not buy or sell gas to hold as a speculative position 
all transactions are immediately offset  establishing the margin to be earned 
promark is exposed to credit risk because the counterparties to agreements might not perform their contractual obligations 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have significant oil and gas operations in canada 
the expenses of such operations  which represented approximately of consolidated cash costs of oil and gas operations  are payable in canadian dollars 
most of the revenue from canadian natural gas and oil sales  which represented of total oil and gas revenue in  is based upon us dollars price indices 
as a result  canadian operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian and us dollars 
forest is also required to recognize foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the debt issued by our canadian subsidiary because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of such subsidiary is the canadian dollar 
we have also acquired additional oil and gas assets in other countries 
although there are no material operations in these countries  our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
in south africa we have an interest in offshore properties with the potential for gas production 
no proved reserves have been assigned to these properties as commercial use has not been established 
if we are unable to arrange for commercial use of these properties  we may not be able to recoup our investment and will not realize our anticipated financial and operating results for these properties 
competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
forest competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
forest also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our future acquisitions may not contain economically recoverable reserves 
our recent growth is due in part to our merger with forcenergy in and acquisitions of producing properties 
a successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  the review will not permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every platform or well 
even when a platform or well is inspected  structural and environmental problems are not necessarily discovered 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that we will acquire such properties at acceptable prices 
there are uncertainties in successfully integrating our acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and retaining and assimilating the employees 
in addition  although we perform a diligent review of the properties acquired in connection with such acquisitions in accordance with industry practices  such reviews are inherently incomplete 
these reviews may not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to fully assess the deficiencies and potential associated with the properties 
any of these or similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results 
the marketability of our production depends largely upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity  operation and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
transportation space on such gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to such facilities or due to such space being utilized by other companies with priority transportation agreements 
the available capacity  or lack of available capacity  on these systems and facilities  could result in the shutting in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
our access to transportation options can also be affected by us federal and state and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand 
these factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control 
if market factors dramatically change  the financial impact on forest could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  the federal oil pollution act opa  as amended  requires operators of offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be incurred in connection with potential oil spills 
under the opa and other federal and state environmental statutes  owners and operators of certain defined facilities are strictly liable for such spills of oil and other regulated substances  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
us and us laws regulate production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products from oil and gas and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
the significant ownership position of anschutz could limit forest s ability to enter into certain transactions 
as of february   the anschutz corporation owned approximately of our common stock and its principal owner currently serves as the chairman of the executive committee of our board of directors 
three of forest s directors are officers of anschutz 
therefore  anschutz may substantially influence matters being considered by forest and its board of directors 
applicable law requires that the holders of two thirds of the outstanding forest common shares approve a future merger with a third party  therefore  control of forest most likely could not be transferred to a third party without anschutz s consent and agreement 
a third party probably would not offer to pay a premium to acquire forest without the prior agreement of anschutz  even if the board of directors should choose to attempt to sell forest in the future 
in addition  shareholder approval would be required by new york stock exchange rules for the issuance of common stock to a third party in an amount in excess of of the outstanding common stock 
anschutz s opposition to such a transaction could significantly reduce the likelihood of its approval 
anschutz engages in the oil and gas business and we have entered into oil and gas transactions with anschutz in the past 
anschutz is actively engaged in the oil and gas exploration and production business and may compete with us in certain geographic areas 
we have periodically entered into transactions with anschutz that are approved by disinterested members of our board of directors 
forest can give no assurance that any transaction with anschutz  regardless of board approval  will ultimately be in forest s best interests or that forest will not be significantly disadvantaged by such a transaction 
we do not pay dividends 
we have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock in a number of years and have no intention to do so in the near future 
in addition  we are limited in the amount we can pay by our global credit agreement and the indentures pursuant to which our subordinated notes were issued 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws and provisions of the new york business corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our directors are elected to staggered terms 
also  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights of those shares as the board may determine 
additional provisions include restrictions on business combinations and the availability of authorized but unissued common stock 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other and with the rights plan described below  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
the existence of the rights plan may impede a takeover of forest not supported by the board of directors  including a proposed takeover that may be desired by a majority of our shareholders or involving a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies alternatives exist among accounting methods we use to report our financial results 
the choice of an accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
in addition  application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  depreciation and amortization  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions and the potential effects thereof are further described in risk factors in this item and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
full cost method of accounting 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
a reserve is also provided for estimated future development costs related to proved reserves and for estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment as a component of depletion expense 
changes in estimates of reserves  future development costs or future abandonment costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
unusually significant investments in unproved properties  including related capitalized interest costs  are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
where proved reserves are established  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limitation which is based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
to the extent the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  the excess is charged to earnings 
changes in estimates of discounted future net revenues will affect the calculation of the ceiling limitation 
we did not have any writedowns related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately  in the us and  cdn in canada 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and approximately per mcf in canada and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us and approximately per barrel in canada 
a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation in the us and canada and could result in a ceiling test writedown 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion and amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
as of december   costs related to these international projects of approximately  were not being depleted pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
in  we recorded an impairment of  related to the concessions in albania  australia  italy  romania  tunisia and thailand 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
a reserve is provided for estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities as a component of depletion 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
we believe the full cost method is the appropriate method to use to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities 
we conduct significant exploration programs in the gulf of mexico  the cook inlet area of alaska  frontier areas in canada and in various international regions 
we believe the full cost method more appropriately treats the costs of these exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
we account for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon our ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether we have taken our ownership share of such volumes 
we record a receivable or a liability to the extent we receive less or more than our share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue is recorded based on volumes taken by us or allocated to us by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than our ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates are adjusted to reflect any overproduced or underproduced positions 
receivables or payables are recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between forest and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
forest prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on our actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
at december   forest had taken approximately mmcf more than its entitled share of production 
the estimated value of this imbalance of approximately  was recorded as a long term liability 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize its united states net deferred tax asset at december   the company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards in to based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada and  through promark  our marketing subsidiary  we market natural gas for third parties in canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to manage commodity prices and to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  we enter into long term contracts and use a hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  forest enters into energy swaps  collars and other financial instruments 
all of our energy swaps and collar agreements and a portion of our basis swaps in place at december  have been designated as cash flow hedges 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
we periodically assess the estimated portion of our anticipated production that is subject to hedging arrangements  and we adjust this percentage based on our assessment of market conditions and the availability of hedging arrangements that meet our criteria 
hedging arrangements covered  and of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
long term sales contracts 
a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool 
at december   the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn canadian forest  as one of the producers in the promark netback pool  is obligated to deliver a portion of this gas 
in canadian forest supplied of the gas for the promark netback pool 
in addition to its commitments to the promark netback pool  canadian forest is committed to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn hedging program 
in a typical swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
we enter into swap agreements when prices are less volatile or when collar arrangements are not attractively priced 
as of december   forest had entered into the following swaps natural gas oil bbtu s per day average hedged price per mmbtu barrels per day average hedged price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  between january  and march  we entered into oil swaps for  barrels per day in at an average hedged price of per barrel and for  barrels per day in the first quarter of at an average hedged price of per barrel  and also entered into additional natural gas swaps covering an aggregate of bbtu s per day for the period april through june at a weighted average price of per mmbtu and covering an aggregate of bbtu s per day for the period november through march at a weighted average price of per mmbtu 
we also enter into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
collars are also settled in cash  either on a monthly basis or at the end of their terms 
by entering into collars we effectively provide a floor for the price that we will receive for the hedged production  however  the collar also establishes a maximum price that we will receive for the hedged production if prices increase above the ceiling price 
we enter into collars during periods of volatile commodity prices in order to protect against a significant decline in prices in exchange for forgoing the benefit of price increases in excess of the ceiling price on the hedged production 
as of december   forest had entered into the following collars for natural gas average floor price per mmbtu average ceiling price per mmbtu bbtu s per day first quarter between january  and march   we entered into oil collars for  barrels per day for all of at an average ceiling price and floor price of and  respectively 
we also use basis swaps in connection with natural gas swaps to fix the differential price between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is sold 
as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps with weighted average volumes of bbtu s per day in between january  and march   we entered into additional basis swaps covering weighted average volumes of bbtu s per day from april through june and bbtu s per day from november through march the fair value of our cash flow hedges as of december  was a gain of approximately  trading activities 
profits or losses generated by the purchase and sale of third parties gas are based on the spread between the prices of natural gas purchased and sold 
promark does not enter into agreements to buy or sell natural gas to hold as a speculative or open position 
all transactions represent physical volumes and are immediately offset  thereby fixing the margin and eliminating the market risk on the related agreements 
at december   promark s trading operations had the following purchase and sales commitments in place for and natural gas bcf purchase price per mcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps that were not designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtu s per day in the fair value of our derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges as of december  was a gain of approximately  foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
canada 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of canadian forest 
as a result  canadian forest is exposed to foreign currency translation risk related to translation of the principal amount of the senior subordinated notes that it issued in late and early because these notes are denominated in us dollars 
the  principal amount of the debt is due in operations outside of north america 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest have been primarily us dollar denominated
