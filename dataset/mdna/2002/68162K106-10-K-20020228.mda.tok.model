inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of personnel  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under the company s credit facility 
inflation did not have a material effect on the company s financial results in however  declining market interest rates on the company s variable rate debt had a favorable impact on the company s cost of borrowings in when raw material prices decline  as in  customer demands for lower costed product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices therefore adversely affected the company s net sales and net income in olympic s primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt
