item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global pharmaceutical company that participates in three healthcare markets biopharmaceuticals  vaccines and blood testing 
the biopharmaceuticals segment consists of therapeutic products and services  with an emphasis on the treatment of cancer and infectious disease  using the development and acquisition of technologies related to therapeutic proteins and small molecules 
the biopharmaceuticals segment also includes collaborations with berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany  related to betaseron  and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  a johnson johnson company  related to pdgf 
the vaccines segment consists principally of adult and pediatric vaccines for viral infections including flu  rabies and tick borne encephalitis  and bacterial infections  including meningococcus c and haemophilius influenzae type b 
we sell these vaccines primarily in germany  italy  the united kingdom  canada and other international markets 
our vaccines segment is also involved in the development of novel vaccines and vaccination technology 
the blood testing segment consists of an alliance with gen probe incorporated and our one half interest in the pretax operating earnings of our joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  a johnson johnson company 
our alliance with gen probe is focused on commercializing and selling nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology to screen donated blood and plasma products for viral infection 
our joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics sells a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provides supplemental tests and microplate based instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
we view certain other revenues and expenses as not belonging to any one segment 
as a result  we have aggregated these items into an other segment 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  inventories  derivatives  intangible assets  product discounts  rebates and returns  bad debts  collaborative  royalty and license arrangements  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments we invest in debt and equity securities 
the price of these securities is subject to significant volatility 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
generally  we believe that an investment is impaired if its market value has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for product lot failures  recalls and obsolescence 
the manufacturing processes for many of our products are complex 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures or recalls and  therefore  additional inventory reserves 
in addition  we operate in a highly competitive environment  with rapidly changing technologies 
new technology frequently results in product obsolescence 
as a result  we may be required to record additional inventory reserves 
derivatives we use various derivatives to reduce foreign exchange and equity securities risks 
we maintain our derivatives with major financial institutions 
we manage the risk of counterparty default on our derivatives through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial conditions 
an adverse change in the financial condition of our counterparties could deem our derivatives ineffective  resulting in a premature charge to operations 
on the date that we enter into derivative contracts  we designate them as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge  or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedge 
currently  we utilize fair value and cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedge and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge 
for fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative are generally offset in the income statement by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
for cash flow hedges  we report changes in the fair value of the derivative in other comprehensive income to the extent of effectiveness 
also related to cash flow hedges  we reclassify any amounts recorded in other comprehensive income to earnings in the period in which the derivative matures and the underlying asset or liability is sold 
we deem all time value changes as ineffective and recognize them immediately in earnings 
product returns for existing and acquired products  we maintain accruals for product returns based on historical return information 
for new products  we estimate our accruals for product returns based on the specific terms for product returns and our projected sales figures for those products 
if actual product returns are greater than our estimates  additional product return accruals may be required 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
collaborative  royalty and license arrangements we defer and recognize up front refundable fees as revenues upon the later of when they become nonrefundable or when performance obligations are completed 
in situations where we have no continuing performance obligations  we recognize up front nonrefundable fees as revenues when receivable 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  we defer and amortize up front nonrefundable fees over the performance period 
the terms of such arrangements may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
specific to royalty revenues  we estimate royalty revenues based on product sales information provided by the third party or previous period actual product sales 
in the subsequent quarter  we record an adjustment equal to the difference between those royalty revenues recorded in the previous quarter and the contractual percentage of the third party s actual product sales for that period 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period that we made such determination 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments would be charged to income in the period that we made such determination 
litigation and other contingencies we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
information may become available to us after that time  for which additional accruals may be required 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  inc  a company that develops drugs including tezacitabine to treat cancer 
we will account for the acquisition as an asset purchase and include matrix pharmaceutical s operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning on march  matrix pharmaceutical s operating results for the remaining business days in february were not significant to our consolidated operating results 
matrix pharmaceutical will be part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
on september   we acquired pathogenesis corporation  a company that developed and marketed drugs to treat infectious diseases  particularly serious lung infections 
we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and included pathogenesis operating results  including the seven business days from september to   in our consolidated operating results beginning on october  pathogenesis operating results for the seven business days in september were not significant to our consolidated operating results 
pathogenesis is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
on december   we completed the sale of chiron vision  our ophthalmics business to bausch lomb incorporated  and on november   we completed the sale of chiron diagnostics  our in vitro diagnostics business  to bayer corporation 
our consolidated statements of operations reflect the after tax results of chiron vision and chiron diagnostics as discontinued operations 
certain minor arithmetical variances between the narrative and the consolidated financial statements may arise due to rounding 
results of operations biopharmaceuticals product sales biopharmaceutical product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
biopharmaceutical product sales in consisted principally of betaseron  tobi  proleukin and pdgf 
biopharmaceutical product sales in and consisted principally of betaseron  proleukin and pdgf 
betaseron we manufacture betaseron for sale outside of europe by berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany 
betaseron is approved for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in over countries  including the us and the european union  and for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in approximately countries  including the european union  canada  australia and new zealand 
we recognize a portion of revenue for product sales of betaseron upon shipment to berlex laboratories and schering  and the remainder based on a contractual percentage of sales by berlex laboratories and schering 
we also earn royalties on schering s european sales of betaferon  which we record in royalty and license fee revenues for the biopharmaceuticals segment 
betaseron product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in betaseron product sales in as compared with  and in as compared with  primarily related to fluctuations in berlex laboratories and schering s inventory levels and increased underlying sales to end users in the us and other countries driven by increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis 
as discussed in royalties and license fee revenues below  betaferon royalties also increased in as compared with  and in as compared with the increase in betaseron product sales in as compared with also included the effects of the second quarter conclusion of certain promotional pricing campaigns 
inventory levels may continue to fluctuate as berlex laboratories changes its distribution structure in the us pursuant to the agreement with schering  we will begin to supply betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for the european market 
this will result in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  with a commensurate decrease in royalty revenues  in tobi we obtained tobi as part of our acquisition of pathogenesis corporation on september  we sell tobi directly in the us and certain international markets 
the us food and drug administration approved tobi for cystic fibrosis lung infections in december pathogenesis launched tobi in the us in january tobi was approved in canada in february tobi cleared the mutual recognition process required for marketing in the european union in august and was subsequently launched in several european countries 
we recognized tobi sales of million and million including million from the last seven days in september in and  respectively 
sales of tobi by chiron and pathogenesis were million and million in and  respectively 
the growth was due to i increased tobi use in the us and canada by patients with cystic fibrosis and ii increased tobi sales related to the launch in various european countries 
we continue to pursue the use of tobi to treat other serious lung infections and to seek approval in other countries 
wholesaler inventory management practices and foreign exchange rate fluctuations may influence future tobi sales 
proleukin proleukin is approved in over countries for the treatment of metastatic stage renal cell carcinoma and in canada and the us for the treatment of metastatic stage melanoma  for which it became the first approved therapy in more than years when the us food and drug administration approved it in sales of proleukin were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
proleukin product sales in as compared with  and in as compared with  primarily were affected by i fluctuations in wholesaler inventory management practices  ii the increasing cost sensitivity from reimbursement authorities  particularly in europe  and iii a weaker exchange rate of the euro as compared with the us dollar 
we expect these factors to continue into pdgf we manufacture pdgf for ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  a johnson johnson company 
pdgf is the active ingredient in regranex gel  a treatment for diabetic foot ulcers 
the us food and drug administration approved regranex gel in december ortho mcneil pharmaceutical launched it in early regranex gel was approved to treat diabetic foot ulcers in canada in december and europe in march net sales of pdgf to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical were million and million in and  respectively 
there were no commercial sales of pdgf to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical from the first quarter through the first quarter  as our sales had filled ortho mcneil pharmaceutical s inventory requirements 
the increase in pdgf product sales in as compared with primarily was due to the resumption of commercial sales to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical 
in addition  net sales of pdgf in included a decrease in the product returns allowance of million primarily due to additional historical return information provided by johnson johnson 
historically  our sales of pdgf have fluctuated based upon the inventory management practices of ortho mcneil pharmaceutical 
the balance of product sales recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other products  which individually were not material 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our biopharmaceutical products to continue into the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item  business competition above 
collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
novartis under the terms of a november agreement with novartis ag  we granted novartis a license to utilize our combinatorial chemistry techniques 
in exchange for this license  novartis paid us million over a five year period

we recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million and million in and  respectively  under this arrangement 
medivir in  medivir ab licensed certain of our combinatorial chemistry technology in the research and development of pharmaceuticals for human use 
revenue recognized under this agreement was million in the balance of collaborative agreement revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  the collaboration agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the collaborative partners commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the collaborative partners will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
also  our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
we have no assurance that new relationships will be established or that current collaborative agreement revenues will not decline

betaferon we earn royalties on schering ag s european sales of betaferon 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  under this arrangement 
as discussed in product sales betaseron above  the increases in betaferon in as compared with  and in as compared with  primarily related to increased utilization of beta interferon therapy for multiple sclerosis  offset by a weaker exchange rate of the euro as compared with the us dollar 
betaferon is the only product that is approved in europe for the treatment of both relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
as discussed in product sales betaseron above  we will begin to supply betaferon to schering in the fourth quarter for the european market 
this will result in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  with a commensurate decrease in royalty revenues  in novo nordisk we estimate recombinant insulin and glucagon royalty revenues based on previous period actual recombinant insulin and glucagon product sales by novo nordisk as 
we recognized million  million and million in  and  respectively  under this arrangement 
the decrease in as compared with primarily related to a million positive adjustment related to a royalty audit recovery in depocyt in the fourth quarter  we recognized a license fee of million upon the resumption of phase clinical trials for depocyt in december in the second quarter  we recognized a license fee of million upon the grant of a european and canadian depocyt license to skyepharma plc in april glaxo in march  we granted glaxo group limited now part of glaxosmithkline plc rights under certain of our hepatitis c virus patents  for which we recognized a license fee in the first quarter japan tobacco in january  we granted japan tobacco  inc rights under certain of our hepatitis c virus patents

results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
also  the license agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the licensees commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the licensees will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
other revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized other revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contract manufacturing revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized contract manufacturing revenues of million in and million for both and  respectively

the balance of other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material 
other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining additional revenues or that these revenues will not decline 
gross profit biopharmaceutical gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in biopharmaceutical gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to a more favorable mix of biopharmaceutical product sales  including tobi  offset by a decrease in gross profit margins caused by the timing of betaseron shipments 
the increase in biopharmaceutical gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to a favorable mix of biopharmaceutical product sales 
we are obligated to pay royalties on sales of certain therapeutic products in the us and in europe to the former limited partners of cetus healthcare limited partnership see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
one of these agreements expired on december  as a result  we expect gross profit margins in to be slightly higher than however  biopharmaceutical gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods as the biopharmaceutical product and customer mixes change 
research and development our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with was due to the furtherance of our clinical trials related to tifacogin recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor for severe sepsis  proleukin for hiv and progress in various other development platforms  including those obtained as part of the acquisition of pathogenesis corporation on september  in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with inhale therapeutic systems  inc related to  among other things  the development of an inhaled tobi product for the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients 
the increases were offset by the conclusion of phase clinical trials for fibroblast growth factor for coronary and peripheral artery diseases and a reduction in gene therapy activities with the sale of the san diego facility in january see gain loss on sale of assets below 
the increase in as compared with was due to the furtherance of clinical trials related to proleukin for hiv and tifacogin for severe sepsis  offset by the timing of various other clinical trials  including fibroblast growth factor for coronary and peripheral artery diseases

beginning in  we allocated certain legal costs to the other segment  whereas in  we allocated these certain legal costs to all segments 
vaccines product sales we sell pediatric and adult vaccines in germany  italy  the united kingdom  canada and other international markets 
certain of our vaccine products  particularly our flu vaccine  are seasonal and typically have higher sales in the second half of the year 
in addition  we expect menjugate sales to continue to fluctuate as public health authorities potentially adopt broad vaccination programs 
vaccine product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in product sales in as compared with  and in as compared with  primarily were due to sales of menjugate  our conjugate vaccine against meningococcal meningitis caused by the bacterium n 
meningitidis serogroup c 
menjugate sales commenced in and amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
during  shipments to the united kingdom continued and shipments to canada commenced  which offset the significant shipments that occurred during in  we shipped million of menjugate to the national health service under a tender to begin a universal vaccination program in the united kingdom 
we are exploring opportunities for additional menjugate sales in other countries 
sales of all other vaccine products were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contributing to the increase in other vaccine product sales as compared with was an increase in i tick borne encephalitis vaccine sales  attributed to regulatory problems of certain of our competitors  ii influenza vaccine sales  as we were the first to the german market this season and iii rabies vaccine sales  due to greater market penetration 
contributing to the increase in other vaccine product sales as compared with was an increase in flu vaccine sales  attributed to i increasing demand  ii manufacturing problems of certain of our competitors and iii the launch of fluad  our adjuvanted influenza vaccine  in germany and austria 
in may  we received approval in certain western european countries to market fluad 
the increase also was attributable to the re launch of our tick borne encephalitis vaccine 
in the first half of  our tick borne encephalitis vaccine inventory failed to meet manufacturing specifications for purity and a portion of inventory was written off 
we expect competitive pressures related to many of our vaccine products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  including  but not limited to  new combination vaccines  as listed in part i  item  business competition above 
royalty and license fee revenues our vaccines segment earns royalties on third party sales of and license fees on several products 
the vaccines segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively

the decrease in vaccine gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to sales of menjugate  including the fourth quarter commencement of royalties based on menjugate sales paid to novartis ag under the december limited liability company agreement see note  related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  offset by a favorable mix of other vaccine product sales 
the increase in vaccine gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to i sales of menjugate  ii manufacturing efficiencies resulting from increased production and iii a favorable mix of other vaccine product sales 
we recorded a significantly higher gross profit on menjugate sales  because a significant portion of menjugate production occurred in as we had not received approval to market menjugate at the end of fiscal year  we expensed manufacturing costs to research and development 
vaccines gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods as the vaccines product and customer mixes change 
research and development our vaccines segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development spending in as compared with primarily was due to the timing of clinical trials related to our various vaccine programs  partially offset by some spending under our collaboration agreement with rhein biotech nv and greencross vaccine corporation

acquired intangible assets also included the assembled workforce  which we were amortizing on a straight line basis over years 
we were amortizing goodwill on a straight line basis over years 
as circumstances dictate  we evaluate the useful life and value of each intangible asset  which may result in future adjustments to the amortization periods or book values 
as discussed in new accounting standards below  we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  this statement requires  among other things  that the assembled workforce be reclassified to goodwill and that goodwill including assembled workforce no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with this statement

we recognize product revenues based on the details of each contract 
in the us  we recognized revenues from sales of nucleic acid tests under an investigational new drug application beginning in the second quarter in the third quarter  we assumed primary account responsibility for a key us customer  which resulted in increased product sales 
in the third quarter  all of our us customers renewed their agreements  most with moderate price increases  for nucleic acid testing products 
on february   the us food and drug administration approved the procleix hiv hcv assay 
we expect that commercial pricing for sales of the procleix hiv hcv assay to our us customers will result in a significant increase in revenue recognized in from such sales 
outside the us  the french government adopted nucleic acid testing for blood screening effective july as a result  we began recognizing revenues from the commercial sales of assays and instruments and the provision of services 
in australia  we signed  and began recognizing revenue under  an exclusive contract with the australian red cross blood service to provide blood testing products for nucleic acid testing screening in the fourth quarter ortho clinical diagnostics under the ortho clinical diagnostics  inc contract  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens for immunodiagnostic products 
we recognized product sales under this contract of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations between and  as well as and  primarily were due to the timing of manufacturing services 
under a june agreement among chiron  ortho clinical diagnostics  inc and bayer corporation  chiron will manufacture bulk antigens for ortho clinical diagnostics  inc for inclusion in products to be sold by bayer 
we expect competitive pressures related to our blood testing products to continue into the future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item business competition above 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses our share of earnings from our joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared with primarily was due to increased profitability of ortho clinical diagnostics foreign affiliates

the balance of collaborative agreement revenues recognized in our blood testing segment  not related to the ortho clinical diagnostics contract  consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
we have no assurance that new relationships will be established or that current collaborative agreement revenues will not decline 
royalty and license fee revenues our blood testing segment earns royalties on third party utilization of our hepatitis c virus and hiv patents for use in blood screening  as well as third party sales of hepatitis c virus and hiv immunodiagnostic and probe diagnostic products 
the blood testing segment recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million in f 
hoffmann la roche settlement in october  we entered into three license agreements with f 
hoffmann la roche limited and several of its affiliated companies related to the settlement of certain litigation in the us and certain other countries for the use of our hepatitis c virus and hiv intellectual property 
two agreements relate to in vitro diagnostic products 
see other royalty and license fee revenues below 
the third agreement for blood screening was superseded in may by two new agreements  one for each of hepatitis c virus and hiv 
revenues under these agreements were million in our blood testing segment did not recognize any royalty and license fee revenues during under these agreements 
royalties will continue under these new agreements through the lives of the hepatitis c virus and hiv patents covering f 
hoffmannn la roche s nucleic acid testing products 
currently  the applicable issued hepatitis c virus patents begin to expire in for the us and in for europe 
currently  the applicable issued hiv patent in europe expires in if and when a patent is issued under pending us applications  the hiv patent life in the us will be seventeen years from the date of issuance 
bayer in june  chiron and ortho clinical diagnostics  inc entered into an agreement with bayer corporation 
under this agreement  bayer will manufacture and sell certain of ortho clinical diagnostics hepatitis c virus and hiv immunodiagnostic products for use on bayer s instrument platforms 
bayer paid us a license fee of million  which we deferred due to our continuing manufacturing obligations and began recognizing as revenue in the third quarter we will recognize the remaining amount ratably through royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
gross profit blood testing gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in blood testing gross profit margins in as compared with primarily related to payments to gen probe incorporated upon resolution of certain contractual disputes in the fourth quarter  as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings above 
this decrease was offset by proportionately higher sales of nucleic acid testing products in as compared with in july  we began recognizing nucleic acid testing product sales for one of our key us customers  which previously were recorded as collaborative agreement revenues 
in addition  all of our us customers renewed their agreements during the third quarter  most with moderate price increases  for nucleic acid testing products 
the increase in blood testing gross profit margins in as compared with primarily was related to a favorable mix of blood testing product sales 
as discussed above  we began recognizing nucleic acid testing product sales for one of our key us customers  which previously were recorded as collaborative agreement revenues  in july secondly  our remaining us customers renewed their agreements during the third quarter  which resulted in price increases for nucleic acid testing products 
in addition  we recognized nucleic acid testing product sales in related to australia 
blood testing gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods as the blood testing product and customer mixes change 
research and development our blood testing segment recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with was due to an increase in development costs related to nucleic acid testing technology  as chiron and gen probe incorporated completed submission of data to the us food and drug administration for the procleix instruments and assays in january see product sales above 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with was due to an increase in development costs related to nucleic acid testing technology 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative our blood testing segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with primarily was due to sales and marketing activities associated with the nucleic acid testing business 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with primarily was also due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with nucleic acid testing technology and  to a lesser extent  our worldwide implementation of an integrated information system in april  partially offset by a change in the method of allocating certain legal costs to segments  as discussed previously 
we expect continued growth in selling  general and administrative expenses related to nucleic acid testing technology as we expand our sales opportunities for additional nucleic acid testing adoptions in other countries 
other collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
our other segment recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  under an agreement with novartis ag 
under the december limited liability company agreement see note  related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  novartis agreed to provide  at our request  research funding for certain projects 
the funded projects consisted of certain adult and pediatric vaccines  insulin like growth factor i  factor viii and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase 
there were two amendments in the past three years 
in december  chiron and novartis amended this agreement to increase the maximum amount of funding provided by novartis from million to million 
based upon a december amendment  novartis agreed to fund through december   at our request and subject to certain annual and aggregate limits  up to of the development costs incurred between january  and december  on these projects 
this agreement expired on december  collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
we have no assurance that new relationships will be established or that current collaborative agreement revenues will not decline

hoffmann la roche settlement in october  we entered into three license agreements with f 
hoffmann la roche limited related to the settlement of litigation in the us and certain other countries for use of our hepatitis c virus and hiv nucleic acid testing intellectual property for use in clinical diagnostics 
under the hepatitis c virus agreement  we received million  of which we recognized million in the fourth quarter we deferred the remaining million  which becomes nonrefundable through in the first quarter  we began recognizing portions of the million based upon the greater of i the scheduled quarterly minimum non refundable amount or ii the actual earned credits as royalties on future sales related to f 
hoffmann la roche s use of our hepatitis c virus patent in its in vitro diagnostic products 
the agreement also provides for royalties on future sales related to f 
hoffmann la roche s use of our hepatitis c virus patent in its in vitrodiagnostic products  which commenced in the first quarter under the hiv agreement  we received million in the fourth quarter  which we deferred  and received million in the first quarter these amounts included a refundable license fee and royalties for past sales related to f 
hoffmann la roche s use of our hiv patent in its in vitro diagnostic products in europe 
these amounts became nonrefundable in january when the european patent office board of technical appeals upheld our hiv patent 
as a result  we recognized the entire million as revenue in the first quarter the agreement also provides for royalties on future sales related to f 
hoffmann la roche s use of our hiv patent in its in vitro diagnostic products  which also commenced in the first quarter when the european patent office board of technical appeals upheld our hiv patent

hoffmann la roche in october and two additional agreements entered into with f 
hoffmann la roche in may  which superseded the october agreement 
bayer in connection with the sale of chiron diagnostics to bayer corporation  we granted bayer rights under hiv and hepatitis c virus patents for use in nucleic acid diagnostic tests excluding blood screening 
in exchange for these rights  bayer paid us a license fee of million  which became nonrefundable in decreasing amounts over a period of three years 
we recognized license fee revenues in   and  which represented the portions of the million payment that became nonrefundable during those periods 
we recognized the remaining revenue in the fourth quarter in addition  the cross license agreement provides for royalties to us on hiv and hepatitis c virus products sold by bayer  which increased in as compared with  and were consistent in and organon teknika in january  we granted organon teknika bv rights under certain of our hiv patents 
the agreement provides for royalties on future sales by organon teknika of assays for the detection of nucleic acid sequences for use in in vitro diagnostic excluding blood screening products  which commenced in the first quarter abbott laboratories in  we entered into a cross license agreement with abbott laboratories  inc  under which we granted abbott laboratories rights under our hepatitis c virus patents 
in exchange for these rights  abbott laboratories paid us a license fee  which became nonrefundable and was recognized as revenue in the second quarter in addition  the cross license agreement provides for payment of royalties to us on hepatitis c virus products sold by abbott laboratories 
the balance of royalty and license fee revenues for in the table above consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
f 
hoffmann la roche pcr agreement under a july agreement between f 
hoffmann la roche limited and cetus corporation a company acquired by chiron  we received royalties on sales of polymerase chain reaction products and services sold by f 
hoffmannn la roche and its licensees 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  under this agreement 
f 
hoffmannn la roche s royalty obligations  with certain limited exceptions for future products  expired in the fourth quarter however  we estimated royalties on polymerase chain reaction product sales based on previous period actual sales 
in the following quarter  we recorded an adjustment equal to the difference between those estimated royalty revenues recorded in the previous quarter and the contractual percentage of actual polymerase chain reaction product sales for that period 
as a result  we recorded the adjustment for the final fourth quarter royalties in the first quarter in addition  we recorded a similar positive adjustment of million in royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we have no assurance that we will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
research and development in  our other segment recognized research and development expenses of million 
research and development spending in our other segment fluctuates based on the timing of license and collaboration agreements 
the research and development spending in included a million license fee related to our fibroblast growth factor patent and license agreement with scios  inc under this agreement  in  we also advanced scios an additional million in exchange for a promissory note  which may be forgiven if certain conditions are met 
we may pay an additional million in licensing fees if certain development objectives are met 
selling  general and administrative in  and  our other segment recognized selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with primarily was due to lower patent litigation costs upon substantial conclusion of the f 
hoffmann la roche limited litigation in october and lower payroll taxes related to stock option exercises during a period of lower average chiron stock prices 
in march  we posted an all time high in our stock price 
the fourth quarter also included costs associated with the integration of pathogenesis corporation 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was due to i costs associated with the integration of pathogenesis  ii increased payroll related expenses and patent litigation costs  iii our worldwide implementation of an integrated information system in april and iv a change in the method of allocating certain legal costs to segments  as discussed previously 
write off of purchased in process technologies the write off of purchased in process technologies was million in on september   we acquired pathogenesis corporation and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased in process technologies for million 
we wrote this off entirely in the fourth quarter the write off of purchased in process technologies represented the fair value at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of the portion of certain in process research and development projects that were not reliant upon core technology 
core technology represents technology that has been utilized in approved or commercialized products 
we did not include certain research and development projects deemed too early in terms of completion metrics and any future yet to be defined technologies in the calculation of in process technologies 
we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were written off 
in valuing the purchased in process technologies  we used probability of success adjusted cash flows and a discount rate 
we assumed cash inflows from any one in process product to commence between and based on current information  we believe that the revenue projections underlying the purchase price allocation are substantially accurate 
as with all pharmaceutical products  the probability of commercial success for any one research and development project is highly uncertain 
amortization expense our other segment recognized amortization expense of million and million in and  respectively 
as discussed above  we acquired pathogenesis corporation on september  and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased technologies  acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
purchased technologies represented the fair value of research and development projects  which we will develop further and support after the acquisition date 
we are amortizing purchased technology on a straight line basis over years 
acquired intangible assets included the fair value of trademarks and trade names  patents and databases  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over to years 
acquired intangible assets also included the assembled workforce  which we were amortizing on a straight line basis over years 
we were amortizing goodwill on a straight line basis over years 
as circumstances dictate  we evaluate the useful life and value of each intangible asset  which may result in future adjustments to the amortization periods or book values 
as discussed in new accounting standards below  we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  this statement requires  among other things  that the assembled workforce be reclassified to goodwill and that goodwill including assembled workforce no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with this statement 
the goodwill and assembled workforce amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively 
restructuring and reorganization we previously recorded restructuring and reorganization charges related to i the integration of our worldwide vaccines operations  ii the closure of our puerto rico and st 
louis  missouri facilities and iii the ongoing restructuring of our business operations 
the integration of our worldwide vaccines operations consisted of termination and other employee related costs recognized in connection with the elimination of positions in our italian manufacturing facility  all of which had terminated as of december   and facility related costs 
the closure of our puerto rico and st 
louis facilities and the ongoing restructuring of our business operations consisted of termination and other employee related costs recognized in connection with the elimination of positions in manufacturing  research  development  sales  marketing and other administrative functions  and facility related costs 
employee termination costs included wage continuation  advance notice pay and medical and other benefits 
facility related costs included losses on disposal of property  plant and equipment  lease payments and other related costs 
during  we decided to retain of those positions to support future contract manufacturing activities 
therefore  we adjusted the number of positions for elimination to again during  we decided to retain of those positions to support future contract manufacturing activities 
therefore  we adjusted the number of positions for elimination to included in the positions were positions at our amsterdam facility 
we transferred these positions to a buyer in january see gain loss on sale of asset below in connection with the december sale of the amsterdam facility 
for the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring and reorganization charges of million  which included a charge of million and a charge reversal of million 
the charge of million primarily related to revised estimates of termination and other employee related costs in connection with the elimination of the positions  of which had terminated as of december  the charge reversal of million primarily related to revised estimates of facility related costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring and reorganization charge reversals of million  which included a charge reversal of million and a charge of million 
the charge reversal of million primarily related to revised estimates of termination and other employee related costs recorded in connection with the retention of of the positions 
as described above  we adjusted the number of positions for elimination to  of which had terminated as of december  the charge of million primarily related to revised estimates of facility related costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring and reorganization charges of million  which included a charge of million and a charge reversal of million 
the charge of million primarily related to termination and other employee related costs recognized in connection with the elimination of positions at our italian manufacturing facility  of which of these positions had terminated as of december  the charge reversal of million related to i revised estimates of facility related accruals recorded in connection with the closure of the st 
louis facility and ii revised estimates of termination and other employee related costs recorded in connection with the transfer of positions at our amsterdam facility to the buyer and the retention of of the positions 
as described above  we adjusted the number of positions for elimination to  of which had terminated as of december  we expect to substantially settle the restructuring and reorganization accruals within one to six years of accruing the related charges 
we expect employee and facility related cost savings due to these restructuring activities in cost of sales  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense through we believe that we have begun to achieve these cost savings 
other operating expenses in  we recognized a reduction in other operating expenses of million resulting from a reversal in estimated tax accruals related to certain employee payments recorded in we entered into tax indemnification agreements with certain officers and accrued an amount based upon the officers related notional excise tax obligation 
as the statute of limitations expired  based upon the officers tax return filing dates  we reversed the related excise tax accrual to the extent that claims were not made against it 
gain loss on sale of assets in january  we sold various assets of our san diego facility  resulting in a net gain of million 
in february  we sold substantially all assets of an australian subsidiary  resulting in a net loss of million 
in december  we sold our manufacturing facility in amsterdam  resulting in a gain of million 
gain on sale of intangible assets in december  we sold certain assets that we had developed or acquired in connection with the research and development of a cytomegalovirus vaccine to aventis pasteur msd and recognized a gain of million 
interest expense in  and  we recognized interest expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared with primarily was due to the conversions of million of the convertible debentures to common stock in october and million of the convertible debentures to common stock in may  offset by interest expense recognized on the liquid yield option notes that were issued in june the decrease in interest expense in as compared with primarily was due to the convertible debenture conversions discussed previously  as well as the repayment of the note payable to novartis ag on january  other income  net other income  net  primarily consisted of interest income on our cash and investment balances and other non operating gains and losses 
in  and  we recognized interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in as compared with primarily was due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances following the million received upon issuance of the liquid yield option notes in june we do not expect interest income in the following periods to be commensurate with due to lower interest rates 
the increase in interest income in as compared with was due to gains realized on the termination of currency swaps related to our german subsidiary and higher average interest rates 
we invest in a diversified portfolio of financial investments  including debt and equity securities 
the price of these securities is subject to significant volatility 
we perform periodic reviews for temporary or other than temporary impairment of our securities and record adjustments to the carrying values of those securities accordingly 
generally  we believe that an investment is impaired if its market value has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period  at which point we write down the investment 
in  and  we recognized losses attributable to the other than temporary impairment of certain of these debt and equity securities of million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the six month review of our equity securities through february   we anticipate that  for the first quarter  we may recognize losses attributable to the other than temporary impairment of certain equity securities of million 
in  and  we recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively  related to the sale of certain equity securities 
in  we recognized a net loss of million related to the sale of certain debt securities 
in addition  in  we recognized an unrealized gain of million related to equity securities classified as trading 
on december   we completed the sale of our interest in general injectibles vaccines  inc  a distribution business  to henry schein  inc and received payment in full of certain advances we made to general injectibles vaccines 
the agreement also provided for us to receive additional payments  calculated as a pre determined percentage of henry schein s gross profit  through we received million and million in and  respectively 
in january  we hedged a portion of our exposure to the british pound related to menjugate sales 
we settled this hedging contract upon substantial conclusion of menjugate sales in the united kingdom in the second quarter this settlement resulted in a gain of approximately million 
income taxes the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  which reflects the amortization of goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets related to the pathogenesis corporation acquisition 
the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations 
the adjusted annual tax rate was of pretax income from continuing operations  when taking into account i the write off of purchased in process technologies and amortization expense on goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets related to the pathogenesis acquisition and ii million of past royalty revenues related to the f 
hoffmann la roche limited settlement 
the decrease in the adjusted annual tax provision in as compared with primarily was due to increases in the amount of tax credits utilized in as compared with  as well as increases in the tax benefits derived from export sales activities 
our reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations 
the adjusted annual tax rate was of pretax income from continuing operations  when adjusted for the impact of the reversal of a prior year valuation allowance  which resulted in the recognition of additional domestic deferred tax benefits of million 
the increase in the adjusted annual tax provision in as compared with primarily was due to an increase in income earned in foreign countries with marginal income tax rates higher than the marginal us income tax rate  coupled with a decrease in net operating loss carryforwards available to offset such foreign income 
the effective tax rate may be affected in future periods by changes in estimates with respect to our deferred tax assets and other items affecting the overall tax rate 
discontinued operations in a strategic effort to focus on our core businesses of biopharmaceuticals  vaccines and blood testing  we completed the sale of chiron diagnostics and chiron vision in and  respectively 
the gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations consisted of the following as of december in thousands reversal of reserves for retention and severance obligations  reversal of reserves for indemnity obligations    gain on the sale of real estate assets   other  income tax benefit provision   chiron diagnostics under the terms of the bayer corporation agreement  we were responsible for retention and severance payments to specific us and international employees 
accordingly  we reserved for such retention and severance obligations 
in  we reversed approximately million reserved for retention and severance obligations based upon a final reconciliation from bayer 
we recorded this amount as a component of gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
chiron vision under the terms of the bausch lomb incorporated agreement related to the sale of chiron vision  we provided customary indemnities 
accordingly  we reserved for such contractual obligations to indemnify bausch lomb against certain potential claims 
in  we reversed the remaining reserves of million upon the sale of the remaining real estate assets  as discussed below 
in and  we reversed approximately million and million  respectively  of such reserves as such obligations had expired unused 
we recorded these amounts as components of gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
we retained certain chiron vision assets  including certain chiron vision real estate assets with a carrying value of million  upon the completion of the sale 
in july  we sold a portion of the real estate assets and recognized a net gain on the sale of these assets of million 
in april  we sold the remaining real estate assets and recognized a net gain on the sale of these assets of million 
we recorded these amounts as components of gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
income taxes in connection with the sale of chiron diagnostics and chiron vision  we recorded cumulative net deferred tax assets of million and million in and  respectively  principally attributable to the timing of the deduction of certain expenses associated with these sales 
we also recorded corresponding valuation allowances of million and million in and  respectively  to offset these deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets to which the valuation allowance relates will not be realized 
we will report the future recognition of these deferred tax assets as a component of gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations included an income tax benefit provision of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the tax benefit in related to the reversal of reserves and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were set up at the time of the sale  as discussed above 
the tax provision in resulted from the estimated tax provision to tax return true up adjustment on the chiron diagnostics final purchase price adjustment 
the tax benefit in included the utilization of additional foreign sales corporation benefits and foreign tax credits resulting from the estimated tax provision to tax return true up adjustments for chiron diagnostics and chiron vision 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards which we will refer to as sfas in this section no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it excludes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of a long lived assets to be held and used and b long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas also supercedes the business segment concept in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  in that it permits presentation of a component of an entity  whether classified as held for sale or disposed of  as a discontinued operation 
however  sfas retains the requirement of accounting principles board opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  we believe that the implementation of the impairment provisions of this standard will not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position  since the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of this standard for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas as it relates to assets held for sale or other disposal will have on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas requires that the assembled workforce be reclassified to goodwill and that goodwill including assembled workforce and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which is superceded by sfas as discussed above 
we adopted the provisions of sfas immediately  and sfas effective january  sfas required  upon adoption of sfas  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that we acquired in a purchase business combination prior to june   and make any necessary reclassifications to conform with the new criteria in sfas as a result  we reclassified assembled workforce with a net carrying value of million to goodwill on january  upon adoption of sfas  we also began reassessing the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets excluding goodwill and assembled workforce acquired in purchase business combinations  and are required to make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first quarter in addition  if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we must test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with sfas by march  we will measure any impairment loss as of january  and recognize it as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter based upon our review to date  we do not anticipate any adjustments to amortization periods 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas adoption requires us to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of january  to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units as of january  we are in the process of determining the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of january  this second step must be completed as soon as possible  but no later than december  we will recognize any transitional impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  we must perform an impairment test at least annually 
any impairment loss from the annual test will be recognized as part of operations 
at december   we had unamortized goodwill including assembled workforce of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill including assembled workforce was million for the year ended december  based upon our review to date  we do not anticipate any transitional impairment losses 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires liability recognition for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we must adopt the provisions of sfas effective january   with earlier application encouraged 
we are currently analyzing the effect  if any  the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 
we understand that the financial accounting standards board is considering new rules on the accounting for certain off balance sheet lease financing 
such rules may require that  among other things  certain off balance sheet lease financing be recorded on the balance sheet 
the financial accounting standards board expects to issue the new rules in april as new information is released  we will continue to monitor the impact of these rules on our june lease agreement see liquidity and capital resources commitments below 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have generally been funded from operations  cash and investments on hand  debt borrowings and issuance of common stock 
our cash and investments in marketable debt securities  which totaled  million at december   are invested in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments  including money market instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government or government agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited 
investments are generally not collateralized and primarily mature within three years 
sources and uses of cash we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities largely was due to i higher tax payments  ii the timing of royalty and license fee payments under the f 
hoffmann la roche limited settlement agreements see blood testing royalty and license fee revenues and other royalty and license fee revenues above and iii million of cash received upon the settlement of a cross currency interest rate swap in we made million million domestic and million foreign in tax payments in as compared with million in domestic tax payments in included approximately million related to the filing of our fiscal year tax return in september foreign tax payments in primarily related to tax payments made by our italian subsidiary 
our italian subsidiary posted profits in both and  and is taxed at a substantially higher tax rate than our domestic and other foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  our italian subsidiary made significant tax payments in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was offset partially by a million license fee payment received from bayer corporation in june  as discussed in blood testing royalty and license fee revenues above 
unutilized net operating loss carryforwards and federal business credits attributed to the acquisition of pathogenesis corporation amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  and are available to offset future domestic taxable income through as a result  we do not expect domestic tax payments in following years to be commensurate with those in we anticipate that research and development expenditures in will increase due to the research and development activities related to proleukin for hiv  as well as advances in research and development platforms acquired from pathogenesis in september net cash from operating activities will fund these research and development activities 
investing activities in  net cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of investments in marketable debt securities of million  capital expenditures of million  purchases of equity securities and interests in affiliated companies of million  cash paid for acquisition costs of pathogenesis corporation of million and other uses of cash of million

in february  our board of directors approved a million capital expansion project  which includes the construction of a parking structure and a research and development facility including a supporting central utility facility in emeryville  california 
related to the parking structure  we had committed to million in design and construction services  under which we had incurred costs of million  as of december  related to the research and development facility  we are evaluating various financing alternatives to fund this expansion 
we expect to begin construction on the research and development facility in the second half of see also discussion under commitments below 
based on current estimates provided in the april agreement with rhein biotech nv and greencross vaccine corporation see results of operations vaccines research and development above  we committed approximately million euro million at december   primarily for the expansion of our italian manufacturing facilities 
these expenditures began in the fourth quarter and are expected to continue through we currently are evaluating various financing alternatives to fund this expansion 
the purchases of equity securities and interests in affiliated companies consisted of a million capital contribution under a limited partnership agreement  a million capital contribution under a limited partnership agreement and a million capital contribution under a joint venture agreement

in  we paid approximately million to purchase the outstanding shares of common stock of pathogenesis at per share 
the purchases of equity securities and interests in affiliated companies primarily consisted of a million capital contribution under the joint venture agreement with s bio which  as discussed above  we wrote off entirely due to the early stage of s bio s research and development activities  a million capital contribution under the limited partnership agreement and a million payment to purchase common stock upon the exercise of warrants 
financing activities in  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of the liquid yield option notes  million in proceeds from the reissuance of treasury stock primarily related to stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and million in proceeds from put options 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by million for the payment of issuance costs on the liquid yield option notes  million for the acquisition of treasury stock  million for the repayment of debt and million for the repayment of short term borrowings 
we issued zero coupon liquid yield option notes in june for proceeds of million 
the liquid yield option notes mature on june  at the option of the holder  we may be required to redeem all or a portion of the liquid yield option notes on june  and  and every five years thereafter 
in addition  upon a change in control of chiron occurring on or before june   each holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder s liquid yield option notes for cash at a price equal to of the issue price for such liquid yield option notes plus any accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal and accrued original issue discount thereon to the date of purchase 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock on the open market to offset the dilution associated with the operation of our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and the granting of share rights 
in  our board of directors approved a total million share increase 
the board has authorized such repurchases through december  as of december   we may repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
in january  we initiated a put option program to complement our ongoing stock repurchase program 
under this program  we enter into contracts with third parties to sell put options on chiron stock  entitling the holders to sell us a specified number of shares at a specified price on a specified date 
for the year ended december   we collected premiums of million and  for contracts that expired  purchased million shares in connection with the put option program 
as of december   we have an outstanding contract with a third party to sell put options on chiron stock  entitling the holder to sell us million shares

in  debentures with a face value of million were converted into million shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share 
the remaining unconverted debentures were redeemed in cash 
we are currently evaluating a number of business development opportunities 
to the extent that we are successful in reaching agreements with third parties  these transactions may involve selling a significant portion of our current investment portfolio 
commitments our commitments as of december  were as follows total due in due in due in due in due in due thereafter in thousands operating leases      research and development facility   capital expansion project   technology services agreement     rhein biotech    purchase and capital commitments   letter of credit   research and development arrangements    insurance related items   defined benefit pension plan   total       we lease laboratory  office and manufacturing facilities  land and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through future minimum lease payments  including those for the leaseback of office and warehouse space in the amsterdam facility  are estimated to be approximately million in the aggregate 
in june  we entered into a seven year agreement with a group of financial institutions which we will refer to as the lessors in this section to lease a research and development facility 
construction was completed on this facility in the total cost of the facility covered by this lease was million 
we account for this lease as an operating lease and  as a result  record neither an asset nor a liability on our balance sheet 
the future minimum lease payments stated in above include only our annual lease payments of million for and million for the first six months of our annual lease payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to the london interbank offered rate on the million lease financing 
since the lease payments are clearly and closely related to the host contract the lease agreement  in this case  this lease transaction is not subject to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for tax purposes  the lease is considered a capital lease the annual lease payments are characterized as interest expense with the tax depreciation on the facility reducing our taxable income and  therefore  our current tax liability 
the lease provides a million residual value guarantee from chiron to the lessors in the event of property value declines 
based upon the current local real estate market  we believe that our research and development facility has not experienced a property value decline 
however  we have no assurance that the property value will not decline between now and the termination of the lease on or before july  consequently  our maximum payment obligation is million upon termination of the lease on or before july  on or before july   we can choose to either purchase the facility from the lessors or sell the facility to a third party 
this option accelerates if we default on our lease payments 
if we purchase the facility  we must pay the lessors million  record the facility on our balance sheet at its cost and depreciate it over the remaining estimated useful life of the facility 
in addition  if we finance the purchase of the facility  we would incur interest expense 
if we sell the facility on the designated sale date  the sales proceeds would be distributed as follows to the lessors for their residual interest in the cost of the facility cost of the facility less the residual value guarantee or million  and to chiron for amounts paid under the residual value guarantee on or before july  if we do not sell the facility by the designated sale date  the lessors may market the facility for sale 
when the lessors sell the facility  the sales proceeds first would be distributed to the lessors for marketing and operating costs  then in the order as indicated in the previous sentence 
if the facility is sold for more than million  we receive the remaining proceeds and  possibly  recognize a gain 
likewise  if the facility is sold for less than million  we recognize a loss up to the residual value guarantee 
as of december   novartis ag had guaranteed under provisions of the investment agreement payments on this lease commitment  including payment of the residual value guarantee  to a maximum of million 
credit rating agencies treat this operating lease as debt 
in february  our board of directors approved a million capital expansion project  which includes the construction of a parking structure and a research and development facility including a supporting central utility facility in emeryville  california 
related to the parking structure  we had committed to million in design and construction services  under which we had incurred costs of million  as of december  we may cancel these commitments at any time 
related to the research and development facility  we are evaluating various financing alternatives to fund this expansion 
we expect to begin construction on the research and development facility in the second half of effective july   chiron and ibm corporation entered into a ten year information technology services agreement under which ibm will provide us with a full range of information services 
we can terminate this agreement subject to certain termination charges 
if we do not terminate this agreement  payments to ibm are expected to be approximately million 
payments to ibm are subject to adjustment depending upon the level of services and infrastructure equipment provided by ibm  as well as inflation 
based on current estimates  our commitment related to the agreement with rhein biotech nv and greencross vaccine corporation is approximately million euro million at december  in future periods  we expect to incur substantial capital spending 
at december   we had various outstanding firm purchase and capital project commitments totaling approximately million 
at december   we had million outstanding under a letter of credit  which is required by german law  related to ongoing legal proceedings in germany see part i  item legal proceedings above 
we participate in a number of research and development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and market certain technologies and products 
chiron and our collaborative partners generally contribute certain technologies and research efforts and commit  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses  to share costs related to certain research and development activities  including those related to clinical trials 
we may also be required to make payments to certain collaborative partners upon their achievement of specified milestones 
we estimate future noncancelable funding commitments under collaborative arrangements to be approximately million in the aggregate 
we had various performance bonds and insurance related letters of credit in the amount of million 
we have a non contributory retirement program covering substantially all employees of our wholly owned german subsidiary 
the benefits are based primarily on years of service and employee compensation 
the program is a defined benefit pension plan and is not externally funded 
we recognized a non current liability of million related to this program 
the actuarial valuation does not allocate the liability across future years  therefore  we have included the entire liability in for presentation purposes 
borrowing arrangements under a revolving  committed  uncollateralized credit agreement with a major financial institution  we can borrow up to million in the us this credit facility is guaranteed by novartis ag under a november investment agreement  provides various interest rate options and matures in february there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at december  and in december  chiron and novartis amended the november investment agreement to reduce the maximum amount of our obligations that novartis would guarantee from million to million 
we also have various credit facilities available outside the us borrowings under these facilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
one facility is maintained for all of our european subsidiaries and allows for total borrowings of million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  and our italian subsidiary also has various facilities  related to its receivables  which allow for total borrowings of million euro million at december  
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  at december   million were outstanding under this facility 
a third facility is maintained for our owned indian subsidiary and allows for total borrowings of million indian rupee million at december  
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were outstanding under this facility 
outstanding borrowings under the indian credit facility were collateralized by machinery and equipment with a net book value of million and trade receivables and inventory with a total net book value of million at december  market risk management our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  the fair value of equity securities held and our stock price 
we attempt to limit our exposure to some or all of these market risks through the use of various financial instruments 
these activities are discussed in further detail in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
euro conversion on january   eleven european union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
beginning on january   the legacy currencies were replaced with the euro 
we had completed system upgrades to assist in our euro readiness effort 
the cost of the upgrades was not material to our results of operations and financial position 
the euro did not have a material effect on our product pricing and gross profit percentages 
factors that may affect future results as a global pharmaceutical company  we are engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this k and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by us from time to time reflect our current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond our control  which could cause actual results to differ 
promising technologies ultimately may not prove successful we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of these programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it lacks the intended therapeutic or prophylactic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
further  success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment  adversely affecting short term profitability  to bring such products to market 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
regulatory approvals we must obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of our products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis 
in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
see part i  item business government regulation above 
product candidates that appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
manufacturing most of our products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process  that is  to show that the process works and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process  including quality control  labeling and packaging  may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures or product recalls 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products that require novel manufacturing processes 
accordingly  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval  which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
specific to our product  tobi  we rely on others to supply raw materials and to manufacture tobi according to regulatory requirements 
we believe either one of our two suppliers of bulk powdered tobramycin will be able to supply sufficient quantities to meet our current needs and we have a supply agreement in place for a minimum term of years with one of the suppliers 
we also have an agreement in place for the formulation of tobi for a minimum term of years 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future supplies of bulk tobramycin on favorable terms  that contract manufacturers will be able to provide sufficient quantities of tobi or that the products supplied will meet specifications 
in addition  any prolonged interruption in our operations or in our contractors manufacturing facilities could result in cancellations of shipments 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including equipment malfunctions or failures  damage to a facility due to natural disasters or suspension of power supplied to these facilities arising out of regional power shortages 
our difficulties or delays or those of our contractors manufacturing of existing or new products could increase costs and cause loss of revenue or market share 
raw materials for manufacturing we use raw materials and other supplies that generally are available from multiple commercial sources 
certain manufacturing processes  however  use materials that are available from sole sources or that are in short supply or difficult for the supplier to produce and certify in accordance with our specifications 
some of our biopharmaceutical products are biologics 
from time to time  concerns are raised with respect to potential contamination of biological materials that are supplied to us 
these concerns can further tighten market conditions for materials that may be in short supply or available from limited sources 
moreover  regulatory approvals to market our products may be conditioned upon obtaining certain materials from specified sources 
our ability to substitute material from an alternate source may be delayed pending regulatory approval of such alternate source 
although we monitor the ability of certain suppliers to meet our needs and the market conditions for these materials  there is a risk that material shortages could impact production 
patents held by third parties may delay or prevent commercialization third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the us and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain products and products in development by us and our corporate partners 
it is likely that third parties will obtain these patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be broad enough to prevent or delay us and our corporate partners from manufacturing or marketing products important to our current and future business 
we cannot accurately predict the scope  validity and enforceability of these patents  if granted  the extent to which we may wish or need to obtain licenses to these patents  and the cost and availability of these licenses 
if we do not obtain these licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around these patents 
alternatively  we could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
we could also incur substantial costs in licensing or challenging the validity and scope of these patents 
product acceptance we may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
we have no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products 
in addition  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of our products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of our product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over our product 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  and biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than ours 
accordingly  even if we are successful in launching a product  we may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  or the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages 
the technologies applied by our competitors and us are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
chiron s patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues we seek to obtain patents on our inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use our inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by us and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate us for the use of the invention 
we have no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to us will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets 
we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will be granted  or the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the us and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor the enforceable scope of its claims 
we have engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of our patents and expect to continue to do so 
an adverse outcome of litigation could result in the reduction or loss of royalty revenues 
even if we are successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to resolve patent litigation successfully may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by our patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
availability of reimbursement  government and other pressures on pricing in the us and other significant markets  sales of our products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
costs associated with expanding the business we expect to grow our business in areas in which we can be most competitive  either through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
in connection with these efforts  we may incur significant charges  costs and expenses which could impact our profitability  including impairment losses  restructuring charges  the write off of purchased in process technologies  transaction related expenses  costs associated with integrating new businesses and the cost of amortizing goodwill and other intangibles 
some transactions may require the consent of our shareholders or a third party  or the approval by various regulatory authorities 
we have no assurance that such in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions will be successful 
other new products and sources of revenue many products in our current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
our ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of our technologies  and on our ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
we have no assurance that we will establish such other sources of revenue 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we have significant cash balances and investments 
our financial results  therefore  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  we sell products in many countries throughout the world  and our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
corporate partners an important part of our business strategy depends upon collaborations with third parties  including research collaborations and joint efforts to develop and commercialize new products 
as circumstances change  chiron and our corporate partners may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
we may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  we may disagree with our corporate partners as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the corporate partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect our corporate partners  causing them to reprioritize their efforts related to the research collaborations and other joint efforts with us 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact our profitability 
stock price volatility the price of our stock  like that of other pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  results of clinical trials conducted by us or by our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners  corporate restructuring by us  licensing activities by us  and the acquisition or sale by us of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with our research and development collaborations  from time to time we may invest in equity securities of our corporate partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect our stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
income taxes we are taxable principally in the us  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws  which could increase our future tax provision 
we have negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes that are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  income taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while we believe that all material tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we are presently under audit in several jurisdictions  and we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  we have assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of our former subsidiaries  chiron vision subject to certain limitations and chiron diagnostics 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact our entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in western european countries 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of those countries 
our primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is associated with the value of the euro 
an increase in the value of the us dollar vis vis the euro will result in a lower value of our non us dollar based revenues 
to manage foreign currency exchange risks  we enter into forward foreign currency contracts and purchase foreign currency option contracts 
we do not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional principal amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
at december   these exposures amounted to million and were partially offset by forward foreign currency contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the forward foreign currency contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a adverse movement against our portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus our portfolio of transaction exposures has not occurred in the last quarters 
foreign currency transaction gains from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were million and million in and  respectively  but were not significant in in  we hedged a portion of our exposure to the british pound related to menjugate sales 
we settled this forward foreign currency contract upon substantial conclusion of menjugate sales in the united kingdom in the second quarter the settlement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which we recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may selectively hedge anticipated currency exposures by purchasing foreign currency option contracts 
our primary anticipated exposures are related to foreign revenues received from selling products in western european countries 
to limit hedging costs  we generally purchase out of the money foreign currency option contracts 
at december   exposures associated with certain euro denominated revenues amounted to million and were partially offset by foreign currency option contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
based on exposures at december   a adverse movement against our portfolio of anticipated transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus our portfolio of anticipated transaction exposures has not occurred in the last quarters 
we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding at december  interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates in both our investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments with interest rates tied to the london interbank offered rate 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our liquid yield option notes because the liquid yield option notes bear interest at fixed rates 
our investment portfolio amounted to approximately  million at december  as of that date  we also had million of floating rate obligations tied to the london interbank offered rate 
we have a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of our portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to the london interbank offered rate 
the analysis below focuses on the impact of changes in interest rates to us and is based on a net portfolio balance of  million 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to us over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income over the month period  partially offset by an immediate decline in the market value of securities held 
the net impact of this scenario is an estimated increase in reported income of million over the month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in reported income of million 
the impact on reported earnings would be greater given that unrealized changes in the value of the portfolio are reported in comprehensive income 
we currently do not hedge these exposures 
a basis point movement in the federal funds rate has occurred in of the last years  a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years  and a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years 
equity securities risk we have exposure to equity price risk because of our investments in equity securities 
typically  we obtain these securities through our collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we classify a majority of these securities as available for sale and  consequently  record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
we periodically review the carrying values of these securities 
we recognize other than temporary losses against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
changes in share prices affect the value of our equity portfolio 
to reduce this risk  we hedged a portion of our exposure through forward sales contracts 
the forward sales contracts substantially offset the long position and  in effect  neutralize the impact of market valuation shifts on the hedged securities 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
in the future  we may use additional hedging strategies in order to mitigate the potential adverse impact from changes in the market value of stock prices 
we have no assurance that other than temporary losses will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we recorded charges of million and million in and  to write down certain available for sale equity securities for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
we recorded no charges in at december   if the market price of our equity investments  including warrants and preferred stock  decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk we manage the risk of counterparty default on our debt securities and derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
we execute debt securities and derivative financial instruments with financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings  which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment or deterioration in credit rating 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down debt securities with a face value of million due to the decline in the credit rating of the issuer 
on march   the issuer paid us principal plus interest 
we have not experienced any other losses due to counterparty default
