we caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot predict these new risk factors  and we cannot assess the impact  if any  of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  you should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
in addition  our estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses  which is constantly subject to change as we implement our fix  sell or grow strategy 
overview we are a global multi industry company focused on profitably growing our businesses that have scale and growth potential 
our strategy is to create market advantages through product and technology leadership  by expanding our service offerings to full customer solutions and by building critical mass through strategic acquisitions 
we continually review each of our businesses pursuant to our fix  sell or grow strategy 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
at any given time  we may engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions or dispositions in related or unrelated industries  asset sales or dispositions  and joint ventures  some of which may be material 
we are a multinational corporation with operations in countries and over  employees worldwide 
we are a global provider of technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology and service solutions 
we offer a diverse collection of products which include networking and switching products  fire detection and building life safety products  tv and radio broadcast antennas and towers  life science products and services  transformers  compaction equipment  high integrity castings  dock products and systems  cooling towers  air filtration products  valves  back flow protection and fluid handling devices  and metering and mixing solutions 
our products and services also include specialty service tools  diagnostic systems  service equipment and technical information services 
our products are used by a broad array of customers in various industries  including chemical processing  pharmaceuticals  infrastructure  mineral processing  petrochemical  telecommunications  financial services  transportation and power generation 
below is a summary of certain highlights included in the accompanying financial statements 
acquisitions we use acquisitions as a part of our strategy to acquire access to new technologies  expand our geographical reach  penetrate new markets and leverage our existing product  market  manufacturing or technical expertise 
accordingly  we have used  and of cash in  and  respectively  to invest in business acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
in addition  on may   we completed the acquisition of united dominion industries limited  udi  in an all stock transaction valued at  including for cash expenses associated with transaction costs and corporate change in control payments 
a total of shares were issued from treasury to complete the transaction 
we also assumed or refinanced of udi debt  bringing the total transaction value to  udi manufactured proprietary engineered and flow technology products primarily for industrial and commercial markets worldwide 
udi  which had sales of  in  is included in our financial statements beginning may  and is represented in the description of our company 
all acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the statements of consolidated income include the results of each acquired business upon acquisition 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at estimates of fair values as determined by independent appraisals and management based on information available and on assumptions as to future operations 
we complete our reviews and determinations of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed within one year after acquisition 
these reviews include finalizing any strategic reviews of the businesses acquired and our plans to integrate its operations  evaluating the contingent and actual liabilities assumed  and obtaining final appraisals of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the allocation of the purchase price is subject to revision for up to one year from the acquisition date 
as a result of these acquisitions  in particular udi  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities at the acquired companies locations  to involuntarily terminate employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of the acquired companies with spx 
united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap require us to reflect these acquisition integration expenses  to the extent that they are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require us to record acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating existing spx operations into acquired company locations as period expenses 
these expenses are recorded as special charges and are discussed later in this md a 
the acquisition integration liabilities are based on our integration plans  which generally focus on three key areas of integration manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies in these activities 
for these actions  we expect that the termination of employees and consolidation of facilities will be substantially complete within one year of the date of acquisition 
in total  we expect to close or sell approximately former udi manufacturing  sales and administrative facilities 
as of december   facility closures or dispositions have been announced and completed 
we expect that additional charges associated with these actions will be incurred in but we do not expect these to be material 
excluding businesses sold  we expect to reduce the former udi workforce by approximately  employees  of which  had been reduced at december  terminated udi employees who qualify will have their severance benefits paid out of spx pension plan assets 
these special termination benefits are accounted for as retirement benefits and special termination benefits in accordance with sfas and sfas during  of pension assets were used to fund employee severance costs and of the remaining workforce reduction obligation  we expect that of pension assets will be used to fund these severance benefits 
other cash costs primarily represent facility holding costs  supplier cancellation fees  and the relocation of udi personnel associated with plant closings and product rationalization 
we expect that the termination of employees and consolidation of facilities will be substantially complete within one year of the date of acquisition 
anticipated savings from these cost reduction and integration actions are expected to exceed on an annualized basis 
employee reductions associated with sold businesses approximate as of december  we amortize goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquisitions on a straight line basis over lives ranging from to years 
in determining the estimated useful lives  we consider the nature  competitive position  life cycle position  and historical and expected future operating income of each acquired company  as well as our commitment to support these acquired companies through continued investment in capital expenditures  operational improvements and research and development 
we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 
in see new accounting pronouncements section in this md a for further discussion 
other than udi  these acquisitions are not material individually or in the aggregate 
business segment information in the second quarter of  we began reporting our results of operations in four segments  technical products and systems  industrial products and services  flow technology  and service solutions 
the new structure reflects the acquisition of udi and aligns financial reporting with the operating structure of the organization 
technical products and systems the technical products and systems segment focuses on solving customer problems with complete technology based systems 
our emphasis is on growth through investment in new technology  new product introductions  alliances and acquisitions 
this segment includes operating units that design and manufacture networking and switching products for storage  data networks  fire detection and integrated building life safety systems  tv and radio transmission systems  automated fare collection systems  laboratory centrifuges  incubators  ovens  testing chambers and freezers  electrical test and measurement solutions  cable and pipe locating devices  electrodynamic shakers  industrial ovens and equipment for the manufacture of silicon crystals 
primary businesses in the technical products and systems include the following inrange specializes in the design  manufacture  marketing and service of networking and switching products for storage and data networks  including fibre channel directors for storage area networks 
inrange participates in the storage area network san market which continues to go through dramatic change 
although affected by the events of september  the market continues to expand with inrange participating largely in the high end of the market as illustrated by our shipment of the industry s first port director in the fourth quarter of despite our decision to exit certain telecom products in mid and a natural decline in legacy storage network products  we expect that inrange s overall revenues will increase by over in in addition  to improve overall profitability at inrange  a restructuring plan was completed in the fourth quarter of  which reduced the workforce of inrange  by approximately 
kendro  which participates in the life sciences industry  is positioned to participate in this changing market 
the life sciences industry continues to move through significant change with the aging global population  the need to maintain or reduce health care costs and scientific breakthroughs including stem cell research and human genome technologies 
kendro  which generates of its revenues from markets outside the united states  is positioned to provide a wide range of lab application products including centrifuges  incubators  freezers  refrigerators  ovens and repository products and services 
edwards systems technology edwards provider of fire detection and building life safety systems  primarily participates in the non residential facility construction industry 
this market experienced a downturn in and it is expected that these market conditions will continue well into the reporting period 
edwards continued to perform well in this market with moderate growth in due to its unique technology position which is driven from its worldwide license for occluded optical technology  the demand for integrated fire and security systems and the demand for updated building codes in developing countries 
edwards systems take advantage of mandated fire protection standards and the unit has launched new products to integrate additional building control systems and bringing security and access control up to fire system standards 
edwards new products eliminate the need for separate installations for fire protection  access control  and closed circuit tv systems 
we expect that edwards will continue to experience moderate growth in dielectric produces analog and digital tv and fm antennas  hf and mf antennas  transmission lines  towers and radio frequency filter systems for the tv market  and cable dehydrator systems for communications infrastructure 
dielectric is a leading supplier in the united states of broadcast antenna systems  including an array of new products designed for the emerging digital transmission technology  which is commonly known as high definition television  or hdtv 
dielectric also is a leading supplier of antennas to fm radio stations and cable pressurization equipment to telecommunications companies worldwide 
one of the growth drivers for this business is the emergence of hdtv in the united states 
the fcc has required that tv broadcasters transmit digital signals  which are required by hdtv  by since the usage of digital tv in the united states is just beginning to emerge  tv broadcasters are required to continue to transmit analog signals simultaneously with digital signals 
due to these industry conditions  combined with dielectric s strong market position  the unit experienced strong revenue growth  excluding acquisitions and divestitures  in we expect these trends to continue in dielectric acquired two companies in  central tower  a multi functional provider of communication structures  and tci  which provides software design and development for radio frequency and digital signal processing applications 
gfi genfare manufactures and sells automated fare collection systems for bus and rail transit systems  as well as for postal vending 
gfi genfare is the leader in bus fare collection systems in north america 
both demand for automated fare transit systems and the level of federal funding are at a five year high  which we expect to continue through radiodetection manufactures and sells portable cable and pipe locators  line management systems for locating and identifying metallic sheathed fiber optic cable  horizontal boring guidance systems  inspection cameras  and test sets 
this business serves a wide customer base including utility and construction companies  municipalities  and the telecommunication industries

primary businesses in the industrial products and services segment include the following waukesha electric systems wes  we believe  is the domestic leader in both medium and large power transformers 
we believe we are also one of the nation s foremost producers of modular substations 
these products are sold under the waukesha electric systems brand names to electrical utilities and heavy industries such as paper  steel  mining  chemical and petrochemical 
consumption of power has been on the rise  and deregulation is driving demand from independent power producers and industrial consumers 
we believe waukesha has prospects for additional growth in an expanding customer base in the industrial  commercial and international markets 
the acquisition of high voltage supply in october and power systems development psd in the fourth quarter of expanded the replacement parts service offerings of this business 
while we believe the fundamentals of this market remain  the announcement of bankruptcy proceedings by enron has lead to a short term change in the buying habits of wes customers 
we expect that wes performance will be consistent with  supported by its growth in service and after market offerings 
bomag  supplier of compactors  stabilizers  tampers and rollers to the infrastructure  and road construction markets  was able to grow global market share in to approximately due to its strong technology  brand recognition and broad product offerings 
the global infrastructure market that bomag participates in experienced a significant decline in  particularly in north america 
we expect that these overall trends will continue in leading to flat to lower revenue  excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  in since its acquisition on may   bomag has engaged in an aggressive restructuring plan focused on the following three actions rationalizing global manufacturing capacity  discontinuing or disposing of non performing product lines and achieving aggressive cost reductions through spx s procurement model 
these actions led to improved operating margins in  and we believe they will contribute to the unit s performance in contech  provider of high quality  precision aluminum and magnesium die cast parts for automotive steering and suspension systems  and filtran  a leading producer of automatic transmission filters  primarily participate in the car and light truck vehicle component industry 
over the last few years  this industry has experienced unprecedented production levels in north america 
in mid  production levels started to experience a decline due to a reduction in demand for car and light trucks 
despite this decline  contech experienced growth of approximately in due to its unique casting process and market position 
over the past two years contech has launched new programs that generated approximately in new revenues 
we expect this business to continue to grow  although current industry forecasts indicate a flat or slightly down car and light vehicle production for north america in compared to filtran  which provides products to both automotive and industrial customers  experienced declines in consistent with industry conditions 
in the first quarter of  this business acquired carfel  a leading provider of after market transmission filters and kits located in miami  florida 
in the second quarter of  filtran announced a restructuring that consisted of the consolidation of its toledo facility with the recently acquired carfel facility in miami  florida 
the unit is in the final stages of the restructuring plan  and we expect they will be completed within one year of the announcement 
fluid power  we believe  is a leading producer of high pressure hydraulic pumps and high force tools 
in march  we completed the acquisition of fenner fluid power  a provider of medium pressure hydraulic power systems components with operations in rockford  illinois and romford  england 
in addition  in the first quarter of we acquired smith s industries  which added additional hydraulic product lines in the uk market 
the unit announced in the third quarter of and first quarter of  the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities in north america and two manufacturing facilities in england  respectively 
the restructuring actions were announced to primarily rationalize manufacturing capacity and reduce operating costs 
dock products  manufacturer of a broad range of materials handling and other equipment for loading dock applications  experienced a decline in revenues in consistent with general industry conditions in non residential facility construction 
the market for dock products is primarily driven from construction of warehouse and distribution centers  manufacturing facilities  and large footprint retail stores and the aftermarket parts and services business 
we expect this market to remain soft during in  dock products consolidated from seven manufacturing operations in north america into five manufacturing operations to rationalize capacity in the unit 
marley engineered products produces heating and ventilation products including baseboard  wall unit  and portable heaters  commercial cabinet and infrared heaters  thermostats and controls  air curtains  air circulators  and heat circulating fans 
the unit serves a diverse base of customers participating in the commercial  industrial  and residential markets 
customer buying habits in these markets are largely driven from seasonal weather patterns for the respective heating and ventilation products 
flow technology the flow technology segment designs  manufactures  and markets solutions and products that are used to process or transport fluids and in heat transfer applications 
this segment includes operating units that manufacture pumps and other fluid handling machines  valves  cooling towers  boilers  leak detection equipment  and industrial mixers

approximately of revenues are realized from the industrial and hvac markets with approximately of mct s revenues realized from the power generation market 
approximately of revenues are generated from customers outside of the united states 
due to mct s market position in the united states and its advanced technology standing in the industries served  we expect mct to continue experiencing growth  excluding acquisitions and dispositions  with particular strength in large field erected tower products 
since its acquisition on may   mct has been engaged in an aggressive restructuring plan focused on the following four actions rationalizing global manufacturing capacity  discontinuing or disposing of non performing product lines and businesses  progressive new product introductions including the field erected modulus tower and the factory assembled primus tower which both reduce lead times and unit costs and productivity improvements in operational and administrative functions 
these actions led to improved operating margins in and we believe they will contribute to the unit s performance in spx valves and controls  a leading producer of industrial valves for gases  liquids  slurries and dry solids  sells products primarily to water supply and wastewater treatment plants  pulp and paper manufacturing and chemical processing industries under the dezurik  powerrac  raven  febco  k flow  maxum  and copes vulcan brand names 
the acquisition of copes vulcan in september provided new technology  complementary products and services  and an expanded international presence 
in addition  the integration of udi businesses mueller steam and cmb provides complementary product offerings 
the process equipment markets were mixed in and we expect this to continue into in the fourth quarter of  this business announced the closure of three manufacturing facilities including the cmb facility in fresno  california  the lake city manufacturing facility and a foundry in sartell  minnesota 
we expect the consolidation  which includes plans to outsource certain casting operations  and relocate product lines between existing facilities in north carolina and minnesota  to be completed by the end of the third quarter we provide fluid systems under the lightnin  bran luebbe and waukesha cherry burrell brand names to manufacture and sell industrial fluid mixers  agitators  handling equipment and metering systems  which we sell to the water  waste water treatment  chemical processing  minerals processing and sanitary industries 
the majority of the process equipment markets were mixed in while the fluid systems revenues largely follow general economic conditions  our strategy is to grow by expanding our parts and service offerings  introducing new products and growing our fluid systems offering to customers to offer enhanced capabilities to end users by providing process solutions 
our fluid systems business is engaged in aggressive cost reduction plans in response to market conditions and to improve operating margins 
weil mclain  provider of residential and commercial hydronics products  offers a complete line of boilers and ancillary equipment which we believe has strong brand name recognition and is the leading domestic manufacturer of gas and oil fired cast iron boilers for space heating in residential and commercial applications 
flair manufacturers filters and dryer products and provides services for compressed air and process gas systems  primarily participates in the petrochemical  power generation  electronics and light manufacturing industries 
in addition  flair provides after market parts and services to these industries 
flair s products have short lead times and therefore the revenues of this business closely follow the markets in which they participate 
service solutions the service solutions segment includes operations that design  manufacture  and market a wide range of specialty tools  hand held diagnostic systems and service equipment  inspection gauging systems  and technical and training information 
service solutions  which sells primarily to franchised vehicle dealers  national accounts and independent repair facilities  is largely influenced by the product launch schedules of north american and european vehicle manufacturers and capital buying decisions of large national transportation accounts 
due to general economic conditions in the united states market and a delay in vehicle product launch schedules  service solutions experienced significant revenue decline in we expect revenues to continue declining early in with moderate increases in the last half of the year driven from scheduled new product launches 
in total  we expect revenues in to be flat on a comparable basis to in the second quarter of  the segment recorded a restructuring charge associated with workforce reductions and asset impairments associated with exiting the dynometer based emissions business in north america and closing a facility in france 
we expect that we will complete the exit of this business by the end of other than remaining long term contractual commitments 
in addition  service solutions has been actively integrating the advanced test and instrumentation product lines acquired from udi on may  these restructuring actions are expected to improve operating margins in joint ventures egs electrical group  llc the egs electrical group is a joint venture between spx and emerson electric 
we currently hold a interest in the joint venture 
egs operates in fifteen states and five foreign countries and is engaged in the manufacture of electrical fittings  hazardous location lighting and power conditioning products 
approximately of the venture s assets are located outside the united states  primarily in canada and france 
we account for our investment in egs under the equity method of accounting  on a three month lag basis 
we typically receive the majority of our share of this joint venture s earnings in cash dividends

accordingly  we expect this joint venture to end in june we typically receive the majority of our share of this joint venture s earnings in cash dividends 
special charges as part of our value improvement process  we right size and consolidate operations to drive results 
additionally  due to our acquisition strategy  from time to time we alter our business model to better serve customer demand  fix or discontinue lower margin product lines and rationalize and consolidate manufacturing capacity to maximize eva improvement 
as an outcome of this process  we recorded special charges of in  in and in these special charges are primarily associated with restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing and sales facilities  rationalize certain product lines and asset impairments 
in addition  we recorded charges to cost of goods sold of and in and  respectively  for discontinued products associated with restructuring and other product changes 
the components of the charges have been computed based on actual cash payouts  our estimate of the realizable value of the affected tangible and intangible assets and estimated exit costs including severance and other employee benefits based on existing severance policies and local laws 
the purpose of these restructuring initiatives is to improve profitability  streamline operations  reduce costs  and improve efficiency 
we expect to take a charge against earnings in  that cannot be fully quantified at this time  but may be material  in connection with implementing additional costs reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
we estimate that we will achieve operating cost reductions in and beyond through reduced employee  manufacturing and other facility costs

liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring provides specific requirements as to the appropriate recognition of costs associated with employee termination benefits and other exit costs 
employee termination costs are recognized when  management having the appropriate level of authority to involuntarily terminate employees  approves and commits us to the plan of termination  establishes the benefits that current employees will receive upon termination  and prior to the date of the financial statements  the benefit arrangement is communicated to employees 
the communication of the benefit arrangement includes sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are terminated 
all restructuring actions taken by the company are expected to be completed within one year from the time of announcement 
other exit costs are costs resulting from an exit plan that are not associated with or that do not benefit activities that will be continued 
we record that cost if it is not associated with or is not incurred to generate revenues after the exit plan s commitment date  and it meets either of the following criteria the cost is incremental to other costs that we incur in the conduct of our activities prior to the commitment date and will be incurred as a direct result of the exit plan  or the cost represents amounts that we will incur under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the commitment date and will either continue after the exit plan is completed with no economic benefit to us or be a penalty incurred by us to cancel the contractual obligation 
we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows or operating income before amortization on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets is likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets  to determine if a write down is appropriate 
should impairment be identified  a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis

consolidated pro forma performance results and the acquisition of udi on may  significantly affects the comparison of the operations 
the following and pro forma results are presented to facilitate more meaningful analysis for readers 
the pro forma results presented  assume that the udi acquisition had occurred on january  and do not include the pro forma results of bolt on acquisition or dispositions as they  in the aggregate  are not significant under accounting guidelines requiring pro forma financial statements 
the pro forma results include estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
however  pro forma results do not include any actual or anticipated cost savings or expenses of the planned integration of udi and spx  and are not necessarily indicative of the results which would have occurred if the business combination had been in effect on the dates indicated  or which may result in the future 
pro forma results reflect the amounts necessary to estimate consolidated interest expense 
the consolidated interest expense has been computed on assumptions that the refinancing of udi debt will occur entirely under the credit agreement and not through the issuance of publicly traded or privately placed notes 
interest income was not changed from historical amounts and debt issuance costs are amortized over five years 
the pro forma assumes the fair values and lives of intangible assets and goodwill as determined by independent appraisals 
the pro forma consolidated effective income tax rate is estimated to be  excluding special charges and unusual items 
the pro forma consolidated effective income tax rate is higher than either of the combined companies due to the impact of estimated non deductible goodwill amortization and increases in foreign income tax rates due to the acquisition

we believe that there is a risk that certain of these net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies

future net pension expense or income is dependent upon many factors including level of employee participation in the plans  plan amendments  discount rates and the changes in market value of the plans assets  which  in turn depends on a variety of economic conditions 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that future periods will include significant amounts of net pension income 
based on current economic conditions  we expect net pension income to be approximately in the funded status of our pension plan declined from december  to december  by the change is primarily due to the following due to the addition of the udi pension plans acquired at may   due to participant service and interest costs  net of funding requirements in  due to market performance of the plan assets  and due to actuarial losses which are primarily due to decreasing the discount rate

in addition  a benchmark study is completed by our independent actuaries against peer companies with similar investment styles 
the discount rate is set based on the yield of high quality fixed income investments  commonly defined as fixed income investments with at least a moody s aa credit rating

we use operating leases primarily when economically supported by our eva evaluation model to finance certain asset purchases 
these leases are primarily used to fund capital equipment programs to match payment terms with the expected production use of the equipment  although the expected useful or economic life of the asset is greater 
at december   we had of future minimum rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
the increase was primarily due to the assumption of leases with the acquisition of udi and bolt on acquisitions completed in contractual obligations total due within year due within years due within years due after years accounts receivable securitization accounts payable financing long term debt future minimum lease payments total contractual cash obligations we have an agreement to sell up to  on a revolving basis of certain qualified receivables without recourse  of which had been sold under the agreement at december  the agreement continues on an ongoing basis to the end of  with a notice period of three months 
we expect to utilize the agreement up to the contract date at which time we will evaluate the facility based on overall cost and our treasury strategy in europe  where the facility resides 
if we do not renew the contract  the impact on our financial condition or cash flows will not be material 
we have an agreement to advance on a revolving basis  certain qualified accounts payable  of which had been sold under the agreement at december  we expect that we will not renew these notes as they come due in and expect the program to be fully discontinued by the end of the second quarter 
represents rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and any other operational cash requirements 
we are in full compliance with all covenants included in our capital financing instruments 
other than of standby letters of credit  we do not have any other material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other then those described in the aforementioned discussion 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  trade accounts receivable and interest rate protection agreements 
cash and temporary investments are placed with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to a large number of customers in a particular industry 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our interest rate protection agreements  but have no other off balance sheet credit risk of accounting loss 
we anticipate  however  that counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk  but we do monitor the credit standing of counterparties 
we continually review each of our businesses pursuant to our fix  sell or grow strategy 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
additionally  we have stated that we would consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria are met 
there can be no assurances that these acquisitions will not have an impact on our capital financing instruments  will be integrated successfully  or that they may not have a negative effect on our operations 
in addition factors that may affect future results that follows  business segment information included in the md a on page of this form k and item 
business included on page of this form k should be read for an understanding of the risks  uncertainties  and trends facing our businesses 
new accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

these pronouncements change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill  and intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  sfas no 
states goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and assessed for impairment under the provisions of sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
during  the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   companies are required to adopt the pronouncement in their fiscal year beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
 and the impact that adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 
based on historical purchase price allocations and preliminary allocations for business combinations completed prior to june   we estimate that the cessation of goodwill amortization will increase our operating income by approximately on an annualized basis when we adopt the accounting pronouncements 
we further expect to record a goodwill impairment charge during the first quarter of in connection with adopting these new provisions 
we estimate that this charge will not exceed in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
will change the way companies must recognize and measure retirement obligations that result from the acquisition  construction  development  or normal operation of a long lived asset 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
as required on january  and at this time have not yet assessed the impact that adoption might have on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and also supersedes the provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement retains the requirements of sfas to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flow and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
sfas establishes a single model for accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of sfas no 
will generally by applied prospectively  and at this time  we estimate that the impact of adopting this statement will not be material 
factors that may affect future results our leverage may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
at december   we had approximately  in total indebtedness 
on that date  we had of available borrowing capacity under our revolving senior credit facility after giving effect to reserved for letters of credit outstanding  which reduce the availability under our revolving senior credit facility 
in addition  at december   our cash balance was see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
subject to certain restrictions set forth in the senior credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness incurred to finance  or which is assumed in connection with  acquisitions 
we may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facility with agreements that have different or more stringent terms or split our senior credit facility into two or more facilities with different terms 
the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and capital expenditures  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because on any new borrowings that may be at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and initiatives taken by our competitors 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facility and the instruments governing our other indebtedness 
our senior credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
we also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our senior credit facility and these other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities  such as acquisitions  as they arise 
if we do not comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facility and other agreements governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our senior credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
in addition  any default under our senior credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facility  the liquid yield option notes lyons that we have issued  or under other debt securities then outstanding 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
our failure to successfully integrate udi and other recent acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  could have a negative effect on our operations  our acquisitions could cause unexpected financial difficulties 
as part of our business strategy  we evaluate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course 
excluding the udi acquisition  in  we made acquisitions of businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately our past acquisitions  particularly the acquisition of udi  which had sales of approximately  for the year ended december   and any potential future acquisitions  involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses  difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems  increased expenses  including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees  increased foreign operations that may be difficult to assimilate  assumption of known and unknown liabilities and increased litigation  and potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses  technologies  services or products 
we may not be able to integrate successfully the technology  operations and personnel of any acquired business 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
in addition  any acquired business  technology  service or product could underperform relative to our expectations 
we also could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems or liabilities of which we are not aware or that are substantially greater than we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of future acquisitions  we may further increase our leverage or  if we issue equity securities to pay for the acquisitions  significantly dilute our existing stockholders 
we may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions  including udi 
as a result of our acquisitions  including the acquisition of udi  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities  to involuntarily terminate employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of these companies with spx 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these acquisition integration expenses  which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require that acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating spx operations into locations of the acquired company must be recorded as expense 
accordingly  these expenses are not included in the allocation of the purchase price of the company acquired 
over the past five years  we have recorded several special charges to our results of operations associated with cost reductions  integrating acquisitions and achieving operating efficiencies 
we believe that our actions have been required to improve our operations and  as described above  we will  if necessary  record future charges as appropriate to address costs and operational efficiencies at the combined company 
we believe our anticipated savings from the cost reduction and integration actions associated with the udi acquisition should exceed on an annualized basis 
our current integration plan focuses on three key areas of cost savings manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies in these activities 
while we believe these cost savings to be reasonable and significant cost reductions have been achieved  they are inherently estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the acquisition 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  and other anticipated benefits could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates and the other information contained in this report 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate  which could negatively impact us 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to our past acquisition rates  which could materially impact our growth rate  results of operations and stock price 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies  businesses and product lines  to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness 
we also may need to raise additional funds to consummate these acquisitions 
in addition  changes in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
the loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely impact our operations 
we are dependent on the continued services of our management team  including our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect 
additionally  we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in order to operate our business successfully 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical  and  accordingly  our business is subject to changes in the economy  pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs could adversely affect our business 
many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles 
certain businesses are subject to industry cycles  including  but not limited to  the automotive industries which influence our service solutions and industrial products and services segments  the electric power and construction and infrastructure markets which influence our industrial products and services segment  and process equipment  chemical and petrochemical markets  which influence our flow technology segment 
accordingly  any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us 
a decline in automotive sales and production also may affect not only sales of components  tools and services to vehicle manufacturers and their dealerships  but also sales of components  tools and services to aftermarket customers  and could result in a decline in our results of operations or a deterioration in our financial condition 
similar cyclical changes could also affect aftermarket sales of products in our other segments 
if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter 
the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously 
consistent with most multi industry  capital goods companies  our businesses have been impacted in by the soft economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not worsen or that we will be able to sustain existing or create additional cost reductions to offset economic conditions  and the unpredictability and changes in the industrial markets in the current environment could continue and may adversely impact our results 
cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings 
we expect to take a charge against earnings in  which cannot be fully quantified at this time  but may be material  in connection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
there is also substantial and continuing pressure from the major original equipment manufacturers  particularly in the automotive industry  to reduce costs  including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as us 
if in the future we were unable to generate sufficient cost savings to offset price reductions  our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
if future cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill  a material non cash charge to earnings could result 
at december   we had goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  and shareholders equity of approximately  on an ongoing basis  we evaluate  based on projected undiscounted cash flows  whether we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill 
based on this method  we expect to recover the carrying value of goodwill through our future cash flows 
if future cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill  we must write off a portion of the unamortized balance of goodwill 
there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in the future that will affect the useful life or carrying value of our goodwill and  accordingly  require us to take a charge to write off a portion of our goodwill 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

for further discussion of these new provisions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
states goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
 described in note  and the impact that adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 
we further expect to record a goodwill impairment charge during the first quarter of in connection with adopting these new provisions 
we estimate that this charge will not exceed we are subject to environmental and similar laws and potential liability relating to certain claims  complaints and proceedings  including those relating to environmental and other matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to various environmental laws  ordinances  regulations  and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations 
these requirements may include  for example  those governing discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants  and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances may have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using that property as collateral 
in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures  we may assume or retain significant environmental liabilities  some of which we may not be aware 
in particular  we assumed additional environmental liabilities in connection with the udi acquisition 
future developments related to new or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup 
there can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion 
numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  in connection with our acquisitions  we may become subject to significant claims of which we were unaware at the time of the acquisition or the claims that we were aware of may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipated 
we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance to protect us against potential loss exposures 
we expect this insurance to cover a portion of these claims 
in addition  we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind as should not have a material adverse effect individually and in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows if disposed of unfavorably 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims is accrued when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we believe that our accruals related to environmental litigation and claims are sufficient and that these items will be resolved without material effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually and in the aggregate 
on or about october   we were served with a complaint by vsi holdings  inc vsi seeking enforcement of a merger agreement that we had terminated 
in its complaint  vsi asked the court to require us to complete the acquisition of vsi  and or award damages to vsi and its shareholders 
we do not believe the suit has merit and are defending the claim vigorously 
on december   we filed our answer denying vsi s allegations  raising affirmative defenses and asserting a counterclaim against vsi for breach of contract 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the litigation 
if we are not successful  the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our inrange subsidiary is subject to various risks and any material adverse effect on inrange could materially adversely affect our financial results 
at december   we own approximately of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of inrange technologies corporation 
based on the closing price of inrange s class b common stock on march   inrange s market capitalization was approximately 
inrange is a high technology company and is subject to additional and different risks  and its public equity trades similarly to other technology businesses 
the impact to inrange s business subsequent to the events on september  reduced its third quarter results and as a consequence  negatively affected the full year results 
inrange s business could be adversely impacted by the continued economic softening 
any adverse effect on inrange could affect us 
in addition to the risks described in this report for our business as a whole  inrange is subject to the following risks inrange s business will suffer if it fails to develop  successfully introduce and sell new and enhanced high quality  technologically advanced cost effective products that meet the changing needs of its customers on a timely basis 
inrange s competitors may develop new and more advanced products on a regular basis 
inrange relies on a sole manufacturer to produce one of its key products and on sole sources of supply for some key components in its products 
any disruption in these relationships could increase product costs and reduce inrange s ability to provide its products or develop new products on a timely basis 
the price for inrange s products may decrease in response to competitive pricing pressures  maturing life cycles  new product introductions and other factors 
accordingly  inrange s profitability may decline unless it can reduce its production and sales costs or develop new higher margin products 
the foregoing is a summary of the risk factors applicable to inrange 
for a more complete description of those risks  please see factors that may affect future results in inrange s annual report of form k for the fiscal year ended december  difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort 
in  on a pro forma basis for our acquisition of udi  approximately of our sales were international  including export sales 
in addition  in  approximately of inrange s sales were international  including export sales 
we are seeking to increase our sales outside the united states 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions 
our foreign business operations also are subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations because of distance  as well as language and cultural differences  increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars  which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices  likewise  decreased strength of the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas  difficulty entering new international markets due to greater regulatory barriers than the united states and differing political systems  increased costs due to domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and transportation and shipping expenses  credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  increased costs of transportation or shipping  ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally during times of crisis or otherwise  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  and local political and social conditions  including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries 
as we continue to expand our international operations  including as a result of the udi acquisition  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
in addition  as we enter new geographic markets  we may encounter significant competition from the primary participants in those markets  some of which may have substantially greater resources than we do 
future increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if certain conditions are met  the lyons could be converted into shares of our common stock 
the shares covered by the lyons that we issued in february have been registered under the securities act and the shares covered by the lyons that we issued in may will be covered by a registration statement 
subject to adjustment  the lyons could be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock 
in addition  as of december   approximately shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options by employees and non employee directors 
as of december   under our employee stock option plan and non employee director stock option plan  approximately shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance of additional options and shares under these plans 
additionally  we may issue a significant number of additional shares in connection with our acquisitions 
we also have filed shelf registration statements for shares of common stock that may be issued in acquisitions and we also have filed a shelf registration statement for a total of  which may be used in connection with an offering of debt securities and or common stock for general corporate purposes 
any such additional shares also could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  and  accordingly  we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in our control not approved by our board 
these provisions include  for example  a staggered board of directors  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our chairman  president and chief executive officer or our board  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  limitations on stockholders ability to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders  the authority of our board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion  and limitations on stockholders ability to remove directors 
we also have a rights plan designed to make it more costly and thus more difficult to gain control of us without the consent of our board 
in addition  we are afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have similar effects 
in general  section prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder each as defined in section for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have interest rate protection agreements with financial institutions to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro  canadian dollar  british pound  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
translation exposures generally are not specifically hedged 
the following table provides information  as of december  about our outstanding debt obligations and presents principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair values 
the weighted average interest rates used for variable rate obligations are based on the rates in effect at december  expected maturity date after total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate lyons  fully accreted average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate as of december  we had twelve outstanding swaps that effectively converted  of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges  and expire at various dates  the longest expiring in november at december  we had a foreign exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in certain euro denominated operations 
this foreign exchange transaction swaps a notional amount of million for euros in june this is a qualifying economic hedge of our net investment in these foreign operations
