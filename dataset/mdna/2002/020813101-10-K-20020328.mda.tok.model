revenues revenues in ipd decreased million due to lower volume in many of our markets including germany and the uk  lower pricing primarily in the uk and germany and the effects of translation of currencies into the us dollar 
the uk market in had higher prices due to market conditions 
these favorable market conditions did not exist in due to interim market pricing legislation adopted in august of that had the effect of lowering pricing 
in addition  uk competition has increased primarily on higher margin products which has also lowered prices and margins 
the interim price regulations are presently being reviewed 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  the present government review of pricing and other aspects of the generic drug market will have on future uk pricing or market conditions 
in new legislation was introduced in germany which will have the effect of lowering pricing 
the company is unable to predict the long term impact these circumstances will have on the company s german operations and the pricing and sales of generic pharmaceuticals in germany 
fcd revenues increased million due primarily to increased volume 
ushp revenues increased million due to increased volume in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing 
the acquisition of the opb us in december increased revenues by approximately million 
in connection with the opb acquisition  the company noted that certain of opb s wholesale customers have levels of inventory generally higher than the company has historically experienced at uspd 
opb management has indicated that these inventory levels are consistent with opb s historical experience 
however  in the event that these customers reduce inventory levels in the future  the company s revenues could be adversely impacted 
animal health revenues increased million due to the timing of the mfa acquisition in may ie seven months in versus twelve months in 
offsetting increases due to acquisition timing were lower sales in the second half of versus due to a change in marketing strategy which reduced certain sales incentives and extended terms 
also impacting sales in animal health are unfavorable conditions in the us poultry market  a fire at an important company shipping location and difficult economic conditions in asia 
gross profit on a company wide basis gross profit declined million as reported and excluding identified transactions decreased million 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit in as reported was  compared to excluding identified transactions and in the reduction in gross margin excluding identified transactions represents lower pricing  lower volume and related production inefficiencies as well as f x effects in ipd offset partially by increases in uspd and fcd due to volume and relatively flat gross profits in ahd

per share 
acquisition program the acquisition of mfa  the acquisitions by ipd and ahd  and the financing required to complete the acquisitions affect most comparisons of results to the company has integrated the operations of the acquisitions and mfa within the respective divisional operations 
the mfa acquisition has been integrated to a greater extent because its assets  operations and personnel were immediately absorbed in existing ahd legal entities 
as a result the full incremental impact of the acquisitions is impractical to segregate 
the company estimates acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately million  in the year ended december  revenues revenues increased in the human pharmaceuticals business by million and in the animal pharmaceuticals business by million 
the aggregate increase in revenues was reduced by approximately million due to changes in exchange rates used in translating sales in foreign currencies into the us dollar  primarily in ipd 
changes in revenue and major components of change for each division in the year ended december  compared to december  are as follows revenues in ipd increased by million due primarily to the acquisitions approximately million and to a lesser extent higher pricing in the uk the increases were offset substantially by effects of currency translation million and lower volume in certain markets 
the pricing in the uk market was higher relative to the first half of  but was lower in the second half of compared to the second half of uk revenues grew in primarily as a result of higher pricing due in large part to unusual conditions affecting the market which abated during the second quarter of effective august  the uk government has adopted interim maximum pricing legislation 
the government has indicated that it will review the interim legislation within the next to months 
market conditions resulted in certain lower prices commencing in the second quarter of and further reductions as a result of the adoption of the above noted legislatio n have occurred in the second half of and are expected to continue in us pharmaceutical uspd revenues increased million due to volume increases in new and existing products offset in part by lower net pricing 
revenues in fcd increased by million due mainly to volume increases being partially offset by translation of sales in local currency into the us dollar 
ahd revenues increased million due to acquisitions primarily mfa million 
offsetting acquisition increases  adverse market and competitive conditions in a number of ahd s main markets caused volume declines and to a lesser extent price reductions in certain ongoing products 
aahd revenues declined due mainly to adverse market conditions and increased competition 
gross profit on a consolidated basis  gross profit increased to million and the gross margin percent decreased to in compared to in a major portion of the dollar increase results from the acquisitions primarily mfa and isis 
higher pricing in the ipd s united kingdom market and volume increases of a number of products in uspd also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting dollar increases were volume decreases in ahd non mfa products and certain ipd markets  lower net pricing in uspd and the effects of foreign currency translation 
in addition in the fourth quarter of  the fda made a pharmaceutical industry wide request that sale of products containing phenylpropanolamine ppa be discontinued 
the company voluntarily complied with this request and as a result  reduced gross profit by approximately million for write downs of inventory on hand and anticipated product returns 
the gross profit percent declined mainly due to the products included in the mfa acquisition which have lower gross profit percents than base animal health products 
in addition  ahd gross profits were reduced by a million write up and subsequent write off upon sale of mfa manufactured inventory 
the write up was required by generally accepted accounting principles 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million and represented of revenues in compared to in the dollar increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions including amortization of related intangibles primarily mfa and isis 
other increases included professional and consulting expenses for strategic planning  information technology and acquisitions  and a 
million charge for severance of existing ahd employees resulting from the combining of the sales forces of mfa and ahd 
foreign currency translation reduced the dollar amount of the increase by approximately million 
the percentage reduction is the result of leveraging of incremental mfa sales on the existing ahd business infrastructure 
operating income operating income in increased by million 
the company believes the change in operating income can be approximated as follows in millions ipd uspd fcd ahd aahd unalloc total operating income acquisition charges mfa net margin improvement due to volume  new products  acquisitions and price increase in operating expenses  net translation and other operating income ahd s million net margin improvement is due primarily to the mfa acquisition offset by weakness in base product sales in a number of markets 
due to integration of the mfa business into ahd  a segregation of operating income is not practicable 
the increase in operating expense for all divisions is adjusted for the estimated impact of foreign currency translation 
interest expense other taxes interest expense increased in by million due primarily to debt incurred to finance the acquisitions and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates in other  net was million expense in  due primarily to million fees incurred as part of the million mfa bridge financing and other financing fees 
the bridge financing was committed  drawn  repaid and terminated in the second quarter 
all fees associated with the interim financing were expensed in the second quarter 
the year to date effective tax rate was in compared to in the primary reason for the lower rate is the acquisition of foreign businesses in recent years and the related restructuring of ownership of legal entities in which provided a one time benefit of million in and will allow for movement of funds between the international entities 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company s operations during  and was not significant 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
all professional accounting standards that are effective as of december   have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the company has chosen to highlight certain policies that it considers critical to the operations of the business and understanding its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
in the company s us human pharmaceutical business  and to a lesser extent in human pharmceuticals international  sales to certain customers require that the company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates  chargebacks  or other managed care reserves 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates  chargebacks  managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions since  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgement and estimation by the company 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas  the company will be required to cease amortization of goodwill and review goodwill annually for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
the assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgements and estimates by the company  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action  the risk associated with those cash flows  and the company s cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis for most inventories  with certain us human pharmaceutical inventory values on a last in  first out basis 
the determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors  including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices 
reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged  obsolete  or otherwise unsaleable 
the company also purchases raw materials  and manufactures finished goods  for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation 
the company reviews these inventories on a case by case basis  and records a write down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained  litigation will be resolved unfavorably  or the inventory s cost will not be recoverable based on other factors 
litigation and contingencies the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  and also to certain other contingencies see item of this form k and note to the financial statements 
the company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred 
additionally  the company assesses  in consultation with its counsel  the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
reserves are recorded when the company  in consultation with counsel  determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was   and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in stockholder equity in mainly represents the exchanges of convertible debentures to equity and other equity issuances totaling million offset by a net loss of million  a negative currency translation adjustment of million and dividends of million 
the increase in stockholders equity in primarily reflects the issuance of common stock in resulting from the million equity offerings and net income partially offset by the currency translation adjustment 
the increase in long term debt in was due primarily to the acquisitions 
in senior debt was paid down with a portion of the proceeds from the equity offerings 
in long term debt increased to finance the opb acquisition 
working capital at december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
balance sheet amounts at year end compared to are affected by the opb acquisition which increased amounts and foreign exchange that reduced amounts reported in us dollars 
the opb acquisition increased the balance sheet captions by the following approximate amounts accounts receivable million  inventory million  property plant and equipment million  intangible assets million  accounts payable million and non current deferred taxes million 
cash flow from operations in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow benefited from the non cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year 
the million ipr d charge  the inventory write offs of million  and the million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for class a common stock are significant non cash charges 
additionally  the company reduced accounts receivable balances compared to by million 
the change in marketing strategy in ah in the th quarter of is the main reason for this decline 
cash flow from operations in was negatively impacted by the structure of the mfa acquisition 
the mfa acquisition did not include existing mfa accounts receivable and accordingly  the increase in accounts receivable as sales were made is reflected as reduction in operating cash flow 
balance sheet amounts decreased as of december  compared to december in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the norwegian krone  danish krone  the euro  and british pound  depreciated versus the us dollar in by approximately   and  respectively 
these decreases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios 
the approximate decrease due to currency translation of selected captions was accounts receivable million  inventories million  accounts payable and accrued expenses million  and total stockholder s equity million 
the million decrease in stockholder s equity represents other comprehensive loss for the year and results from the strengthening of the us dollar in against all major functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
in  the company s capital expenditures including expenditures for a company wide erp system were million  and in the company plans to spend approximately the same amount 
the company has approved a number of capital projects including the construction of a ahd plant for lasalocid  and a company wide information technology project which is expected to require additional capital expenditures of approximately million through in september  the company acquired a technology license and option agreement for the animal health product  reporcin 
the agreement requires additional payments as additional regulatory approvals for the product are obtained in certain markets 
total additional payments at december  of approximately million are required over the next years if all possible country approvals are received 
under the terms of the agreement  the company was required to complete an fda approved production facility for reporcin 
to meet that requirement  the company purchased a biopharmaceutical production facility in terre haute  indiana in june and began to prepare the facility for production of reporcin 
due to a reassessment of the company s approach to the us market  the facility  on which the company has expended million  was not complete at december  while the company continues to pursue regulatory approval for reporcin in the us  this reassessment has re sulted in changes to or delays in planned activities related to the completion of the terre haute facility 
however  the company has reviewed the facility for impairment and determined  based on present facts and circumstances  no write down of the facility is required at december  at december   the company had million in cash  available short term lines of credit of approximately million and million available under its credit facility 
a portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
the credit facility requires the company enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on of its debt 
in early  the company entered into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for million of its variable debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
in the fourth quarter of the company completed the acquisition of the opb see note and entered into a million credit agreement credit facility to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement 
the credit facility includes restrictive covenants  and the most restrictive of these covenants is the total leverage ratio  which is total debt as defined divided by ebitda as defined 
this requires the calculation of ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  on a rolling four quarter basis and pro forma for the acquisition of the opb 
the company is in compliance with these covenants as of december  continued compliance with these covenants in is dependent on the company s ebitda  and therefore the company s ability to generate operating income  and also on the company s ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt 
the company has undertaken certain actions in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt as part of an overall deleveraging plan 
under this plan  the company in december repaid term debt of million and exchanged common shares for million of convertible subordinated debt 
additionally  in the first quarter of  the company exchanged common shares for approximately million of convertible subordinated debt 
based on the above actions  combined with expected improvement in operating profit in relative to  the company fully expects to comply with these covenants throughout additionally  the company believes it has the ability to further reduce operating or capital expenditures  and sufficient access to capital such that debt could be further reduced  if these actions become necessary to comply with the covenants 
at december   the company s contractual cash obligations can be summarized as follows contractual cash commitments total less than year years years more than years long term debt senior and other convertible subordinated operating leases total contractual cash commitments can be settled in shares of the company s class a common stock at option of holder 
under the terms of certain business and product acquisition agreements  the company may be required to make additional payments in future years upon the occurrence of specified events 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
additionally  the company has entered into certain supply agreements which may require payments under certain circumstances if minimum quantities are not purchased by the company 
see note for additional information 
derivative financial instruments market risk and risk management policies the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december  the company had forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material 
all contracts expire in the first three quarters of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than 
million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes 
at december  the company has no interest rate agreements outstanding 
in early the company entered into interest rate agreements to fix interest rates for million of its variable rate debt 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations sfas and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june   and requires these business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas applies to all goodwill and intangibles acquired in a business combination 
under sfas  all goodwill  including goodwill acquired before initial application of the standard  will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of the statement  and at least annually thereafter 
intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of
