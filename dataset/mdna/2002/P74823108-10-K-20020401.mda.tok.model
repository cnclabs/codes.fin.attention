item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion addresses the financial condition and results of operations of panamco and its consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements the financial statements  as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
in  the panamco central america group was created  which consists of panamco costa rica  panamco nicaragua and panamco guatemala 
prior to the second quarter of  the financial condition and results of operations of these three companies were previously reported together in the financial statements entitled panamco central america 
in february  the north latin american division nolad was created  which consists of panamco mexico and panamco central america 
the results of operations of panamco mexico and panamco central america are reported together as panamco nolad 
unit case means ounces of finished beverage product eight ounce servings 
average sales prices per unit case means net sales in us dollars for the period divided by the number of unit cases sold during the same period 
cash operating profit means operating income plus depreciation  amortization  including amortization of goodwill  and noncash facilities reorganization charges 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting policies that underlie the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and how we have applied them in the preparation of the financial statements are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting policy basis for translation property  plant and equipment bottles and cases impairment franchisor incentives derivative instruments inflation effect of inflation on financial information our net sales  and almost all operating costs  in each of mexico  brazil  colombia  venezuela  costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala  are denominated in the currency of such country 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation sfas  the financial statements of our subsidiaries are remeasured or translated into us dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings and purchases of machinery and equipment are often made in us dollars 
during any period when the rate of inflation in a particular country exceeds the rate of devaluation of the local currency against the us dollar  all amounts recorded in the statement of operations tend to be higher when translated into us dollars than would be the case in the absence of such an excess 
conversely  if devaluation exceeds inflation  amounts recorded in the statement of operations tend to be lower when translated into us dollars 
the following table compares the rate of inflation  as measured by certain national consumer price indices in the seven countries  with the rate of devaluation revaluation for the periods shown year ended december  mexico inflation currency devaluation revaluation brazil inflation currency devaluation colombia inflation currency devaluation venezuela inflation currency devaluation costa rica inflation currency devaluation nicaragua inflation currency devaluation guatemala inflation currency devaluation inflation figures are based on the applicable consumer price index obtained from official local sources from each respective country and currency devaluation revaluation figures are based on official us dollar exchange rates at year end 
the level of inflation has a direct impact on the method used to translate the financial statements from the local currency to the reporting currency 
sfas provides that  in a highly inflationary economy defined as having cumulative inflation for the three year period preceding the balance sheet date of approximately or more  the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation is included in the determination of net income for the period and is reflected as gains or losses in the related statement of operations accounts 
such gains and losses do not affect the statement of operations of companies operating in economies  which are not considered highly inflationary but are instead included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
mexico  brazil  costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala are not classified as highly inflationary economies and the functional currencies for financial reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are the mexican peso  brazilian real  costa rican colon  nicaraguan cordoba and guatemalan quetzal  respectively 
colombia and venezuela were classified as highly inflationary economies and accordingly their financial statements have been remeasured into us dollars in accordance with sfas effective december   we discontinued classifying colombia as a highly inflationary economy  and  accordingly  the functional currency of our colombian operations was changed from the us dollar to the colombian peso 
the effect of the change represented a decrease in both the deferred income tax balance and shareholders equity of million in as a result of this change and going forward  the financial statements of our colombian subsidiary will be translated from the colombian peso to the us dollar  whereby translation adjustments gains or losses will not be reported in the statement of operations but will be reported separately and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of shareholders equity 
effect of inflation and changing prices on operations in addition to high inflation  our operations are carried out in countries which in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  government price controls 
while price controls have been a limiting factor  we have been generally effective in the recent past in increasing prices in local currency terms at least at the rate of inflation 
all of our costs are affected by inflation rates in the countries in which we operate 
in general  transactions in these countries are effectively tied to inflation either through pricing  contract indexing  statute or informal practice 
although currently there are no formal price controls on soft drinks in our franchise territories  price and wage controls remain in effect in mexico and brazil for certain other products and services  and price increases for soft drinks in mexico and colombia are subject to the informal approval of the respective governments 
our sales also have been  and may in the future be  adversely affected when wages rise more slowly than the rate of inflation  resulting in a loss of consumer purchasing power 
this has been the case in brazil  venezuela and colombia recently 
in mexico  brazil  colombia  venezuela  costa rica and nicaragua  income taxes are indexed to reflect the effects of inflation  however  the effects of inflation are calculated differently for purposes of local taxation and financial reporting 
seasonality all product sales are generally higher during the december holidays and during the hottest and driest periods with rainfall varying from year to year 
for this reason  we typically experience our best results of operations in the second and fourth quarters 
however  the seasonality effect is tempered in our case because of the difference in the timing of the summer months in the countries in which we operate 
in brazil  summer occurs during november  december and january  while summer occurs in mexico  colombia  venezuela  costa rica  guatemala and nicaragua during the months of june  july and august 
forward looking statements the nature of our operations and the environment in which we operate subject us to changing economic  competitive  regulatory and technological conditions  risks and uncertainties 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we note the following facts that  among others  could cause future results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this document forward looking statements  contained in this document include the amount of future capital expenditures and the possible uses of proceeds from any future borrowings 
the words believes  intends  expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  predicts  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements  estimates  and projections reflect various assumptions by our management  concerning anticipated results and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could cause results to differ include  but are not limited to  changes in the soft drink business environment including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preference  changes in governmental laws and regulations including income and excise taxes  market demand for new and existing products  raw material prices and devaluation of local currencies against the us dollar 
a discussion of certain of the factors that could cause actual results to differ is set forth in our registration statement on form s  dated july  file no 

these and other factors are also discussed in this document  particularly in item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that such statements  estimates and projections will be realized 
the forecasts and actual results will likely vary and those variations may be material 
we make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such statements  estimates or projections contained in this document or that any forecast contained herein will be achieved 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
these statements speak only as of their dates  and we undertake no obligations to update or revise any of them  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
minority interests in results of operations we conduct our operations through tiers of subsidiaries in which  in some cases  minority shareholders hold interests 
see item business corporate structure holding company structure for further discussion on ownership interest in our subsidiaries 
because we have varying percentage ownership interests in our approximately consolidated subsidiaries  the amount of the minority interest in income or loss before minority interest during a period depends upon the revenues and expenses of each of the consolidated subsidiaries and the percentage of each of such subsidiary s capital stock owned by minority shareholders during that period 
certain subsidiary financial information income statement and balance sheet data for panamco nolad panamco mexico and panamco central america  which consists of costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala  panamco brazil  panamco colombia  and panamco venezuela  are presented on the following pages 
the data presented as of and for each of the three years in the period ended december  have been derived from the audited combined financial statements of panamco mexico and panamco central america costa rica  nicaragua and guatemala  the audited consolidated financial statements of panamco colombia and panamco venezuela and the audited combined financial statements of panamco brazil  as the case may be  which financial statements are not included herein 
as set forth in such income statement and balance sheet data  minority interest in the panamco mexico part of panamco nolad  panamco brazil and panamco colombia subsidiaries and net income attributable to the panamco mexico  panamco brazil and panamco colombia holding companies give effect to minority shareholdings below the country holding company level 
minority interest in the panamco mexico  panamco brazil and panamco colombia holding companies refers to the aggregate minority interest in the net income of the respective country level holding company 
net income attributable to panamco gives effect to the deduction from net income of the minority interests at both the country level holding company and the subsidiary levels

soft drink sales volume for the year increased by  reflecting increases of in brazil and in colombia  offset by decreases of in the nolad region and in venezuela 
unit case sales volume of bottled water increased to million  and beer  sold in brazil and venezuela  increased to million unit cases 
volume and net sales growth during the year were positively impacted by panamco s continued effort in introducing new products 
during the year  we introduced twelve new products including flavored waters  juice based products and energy drinks 
these products have had the effect of broadening our portfolio to better meet consumer needs 
we have also been active in introducing new presentations at both ends of the size spectrum 
the smaller presentations are designed to capture consumers for whom the product would otherwise not be affordable while the larger presentations provide a more attractive alternative for in home consumption 
the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in  mainly due to an increase in the cost of raw materials and packaging throughout most operations as well as a change in product mix towards non returnables 
during the fourth quarter of  the price of sugar in mexico increased approximately 
the following comparison of panamco s and consolidated results of operations  excludes the effect of facilities reorganization charges  asset write downs presented as part of depreciation and amortization  and nonoperating charges during totaling million  net of the related tax benefit of million 
see compared to facilities reorganization charges for further discussion on panamco s facilities reorganization charges 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  mainly as a result of a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  the result of the benefits associated with our reorganization programs  and a decrease in depreciation and amortization  mainly the result of lower property and equipment balances and a lower goodwill cost basis 
see compared to facilities reorganization charges for further discussion on panamco s facilities reorganization charges 
the two facilities reorganization programs announced in have resulted in estimated combined savings of million to date  of which approximately million was achieved during approximately  employees have been terminated by panamco as of december  under these programs 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated our original estimated headcount reduction of approximately  employees and determined that the headcount reduction would now approximate  employees 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the following additional adjustments to the reorganization programs i we reversed into income million of charges related to the sale of property in venezuela that we have decided not to sell  and ii we increased the restructuring allowance by million related to job terminations and severance payments primarily at our corporate headquarters in miami  florida 
operating income increased to million from million in  primarily as a result of the benefits of the reorganization programs initiated in and cash operating profit increased to million in from million in venezuela and the nolad region reported the highest rate of cop improvement compared to  to and  respectively 
in february  the venezuelan government abandoned the trading band for its currency  the venezuelan bolivar  which had the effect of quickly depreciating the currency 
from january  to march   the bolivar devalued relative to the us dollar 
the devaluaton of the bolivar is expected to increase the relative price of dollar denominated raw materials of panamco venezuela and to decrease its us dollar reported net sales and other financial statement accounts  including net income 
unit case volumes may be adversely affected to the extent of a slowdown in the venezuelan economy 
additional effects of the devaluation in venezuela will depend on  among other things  the rate of inflation in venezuela in comparison to the rate of devaluation 
see item business currency devaluation and fluctuations 
net interest expense decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to a gross debt reduction to million at the end of the year  from  million at the end of total net debt gross debt minus cash and equivalents decreased to million at december   from  million at december  other expense  net decreased to million in from million in  primarily caused by a million decrease in the provision for contingencies  a million increase in gains on sale of property and equipment and investments  a million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated companies  and a million increase in capital expenditure incentives from coca cola  offset by a million increase in foreign exchange losses primarily in brazil due to a devaluation of the brazilian real during the decrease in the remaining other expense  net was primarily offset by a million charge  derived from the reclassification of unrealized losses related to a floating to fixed interest rate swap  from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense  net 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to from in the lower effective income tax rate of in was largely impacted by a benefit for income taxes of million in our venezuelan operations  the result of a million reversal of valuation allowance against tax loss carryforwards 
the effective income tax rate of in the period is considered unusual and resulted from the relative low income during and non deductibility of significant expenses such as amortization of goodwill 
as a result of the foregoing  panamco recorded net income in of million  or per basic share on a diluted basis  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  during compared to consolidated results of operations net sales increased to billion in from billion in  mainly due to an increase of in consolidated unit case sales volume 
total unit cases sales increased to  million cases from  million unit cases in the soft drink sales volume for the period increased by  reflecting increases of in mexico  in venezuela  in the central american region  in colombia and in brazil 
unit case sales volume of bottled water increased to million  and beer  sold in brazil and venezuela  increased to million unit cases 
the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in this decrease resulted primarily from cost savings in raw materials and packaging in several countries due to improved procurement contracts 
the following discussion reflects the consolidated results of operations excluding the recording of facilities reorganization charges  asset write downs presented as part of depreciation  and nonoperating charges totaling million million in  net of the related tax benefit of million million in 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to in from in  mainly as a result of the corporate office move to miami and a charge of million related to senior management changes 
operating income increased to million from million in  primarily as a result of the initial benefits of the reorganization program 
cash operating profit increased to million in from million in net interest expense increased to million in from million in  due primarily to an increase in the average variable london inter bank offered rate libor interest rate 
total net debt decreased to  million at december  from  million at december  other expense  net decreased to million in from million in  primarily caused by a decrease in foreign exchange losses in brazil due to a devaluation of the brazilian real during  partially offset by a loss in sale of investments of million  a million decrease in operating income from non bottling subsidiaries  and a million decrease in capital expenditure incentives from coca cola 
the consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to in from in  as a result of the effect of the asset tax minimum tax in venezuela and our decision to establish a valuation allowance on benefits of tax loss carry forwards from prior years in venezuela because of the uncertainty that we would have sufficient taxable income in the near term to offset against such benefits in as a result of the foregoing  panamco had a net loss in of million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  during facilities reorganization charges during the first quarter of  panamco began a company wide reorganization program designed to improve productivity and strengthen the company s competitive position in the beverage industry 
the program includes productivity initiatives to streamline panamco s manufacturing infrastructure  consolidation of distribution centers and warehouses  and the termination of approximately  jobs across all levels of the company 
during the fourth quarter of  panamco performed an analysis of the company s growth opportunities  cost structure and asset valuation 
this resulted in several new steps to further position the company for improved financial performance and future growth 
these steps include additional restructuring of the distribution system in brazil and venezuela  plant closings and related disposal of property  plant and equipment  write down of goodwill in the venezuelan operating unit  write off of obsolete property and equipment  bottles and cases  and asset write downs related to coolers 
during the year ended december   panamco recorded charges of million  which was comprised of million of facilities reorganization charges  million of asset write downs presented as part of depreciation and amortization expenses  and million of charges related to the disposal of nonoperating assets presented in other income expense 
the following is a detail of the aforementioned items i 
facilities reorganization charges of million consist of restructuring charges totaling million consist of o cash restructuring charges totaling approximately million  which include million related to job terminations and million related to the restructuring of our distribution system in brazil and venezuela  and o noncash restructuring charges totaling approximately million  which result from plant closings and the related disposal of property  plant and equipment 
asset write offs totaling million consist of o million write down of goodwill reflecting the recognition of impairment of the cost in excess of net assets acquired in the venezuelan operating unit  o million of obsolete property  plant and equipment in all operating units  o million of obsolete bottles and cases  mainly in the venezuelan unit s water jug business  and o million of cash charges related to the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
nonrecurring charges totaling million related to legal contingencies mostly pertaining to tax matters 
ii 
asset write downs totaling million presented as part of depreciation and amortization expenses consist of o million from an increase in provision related to changing the useful lives of coolers  and o million resulting from the write down of bottles and cases due to loss in market value 
iii 
nonoperating asset charges totaling million related to the disposal of nonoperating assets  including the sale of affiliated companies and land in some of the operating units 
as a result of the above  panamco s income for the year was impacted by facilities reorganization charges  asset write downs and nonoperating charges totaling million  net of the related tax benefit of approximately million  compared to facilities reorganization charges totaling million  net of the related tax benefit of million in the following table shows a summary of the net charges and benefits recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  fourth first total quarter quarter total depreciation and amortization  excluding goodwill asset write downs   facilities reorganization charges cash     noncash     other income expense  net nonoperating charges    gross charges     tax benefit     net charges     capital expenditures total capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  approximately   and of such expenditures were made by panamco nolad  panamco brazil  panamco colombia and panamco venezuela  respectively 
total purchases for bottles and cases were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  approximately   and of such expenditures were made by panamco nolad  panamco brazil  panamco colombia and panamco venezuela  respectively 
our board of directors has established various criteria for the allocation of capital resources 
the factors that management reviews in proposing three year capital budgets include anticipated internal rates of return  pay back periods and eva r economic value added analysis from various investments  corresponding plans of coca cola and anticipated levels of earnings and debt in the country in which such expenditures are proposed to be made 
during  we estimate that we will have aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million 
estimates of capital expenditures are based on our current expectations and are subject to change 
actual costs may exceed estimates or we may reallocate or alter our capital budget 
we intend to fund our capital expenditure program with cash on hand  consolidated cash flow from operations and borrowings at the holding and subsidiary level 
coca cola from time to time provides incentives for its bottlers to make particular types of capital expenditures 
during  and  such incentives consisted of grants  which are included as other income in other income expense in the consolidated financial statements  and loans included in the indebtedness referred to above 
during the second quarter of  coca cola changed its cold equipment capital participation program to ensure that any funds received by us during and future years will be recognized as income in installments over a month period 
our ability to include such amounts as income will also depend on whether we meet certain conditions in the future 
prior to the change  such amounts were included as income upon receipt  as no future conditions were required to be met  without regard to our earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
coca cola also provides cooperative advertising support to us 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations amounted to million in  a million increase from cash provided by investing activities amounted to million and included the release of investments in bank deposits for million  which guaranteed bank loans obtained by subsidiaries and were therefore previously classified as noncurrent investments as well as million proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
cash generated from operations and from investing activities was primarily used to pay down million of our syndicated loan  to prepay million of the remaining outstanding debt with coca cola  to help reduce our venezuelan and brazilian debt  and to repurchase million of our shares 
other uses of cash included capital expenditures  bottling and packaging expenditures and payment of shareholder dividends 
at december   we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of compared to million as of december  at december   we had negative working capital of million  a slight improvement compared to a negative working capital of million as of december  a working capital deficit is not unusual for us and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we continue to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities when they are due and have sufficient liquidity and financial resources to manage our day to day cash needs 
as a holding company  our principal sources of cash are dividends from our subsidiaries and sales of our securities 
the amount of dividends payable by the subsidiaries to us is subject to general limitations imposed by the corporate laws of the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of such subsidiaries 
dividends paid to us and other foreign shareholders by the subsidiaries are subject to investment registration requirements and withholding taxes 
withholding tax rates on dividends are in colombia and in costa rica 
there are no withholding taxes on dividends paid by panamco brazil to the company out of income earned after december   and no withholding taxes on dividends paid by panamco nicaragua and panamco guatemala 
effective january   venezuela imposed a withholding tax and colombia imposes a withholding tax on dividends that arise from earnings that have not been subject to the payment of income tax 
dividends from earnings generated until are not subject to income taxes in mexico  as long as they are paid from net taxed income ufin 
dividends not paid from ufin are subject to a income tax 
if earnings generated after for which no corporate tax has been paid are distributed  the tax must be paid upon distribution of the dividends 
consequently  we must keep a record of earnings subject to each tax rate 
in the past  we have paid substantially all cash received as dividends from our subsidiaries  net of holding company expenses  to our shareholders and have not used such funds to make investments  primarily to avoid having undistributed foreign personal holding company income  which would be includable in the income of our shareholders who are united states persons 
we may  therefore  be substantially dependent in the future on sources of financing other than dividends from subsidiaries  including external sources  to finance holding company investments such as acquiring minority interests in our subsidiaries or acquiring additional bottling enterprises 
total consolidated indebtedness decreased to million at the end of  from  million at the end of  consisting of million at the holding company level and million of subsidiary indebtedness 
of the total debt  is long term 
our dollar denominated debt decreased to at the end of from at the end of the million reduction in gross debt is mainly the result of a combination of a million pay down of our syndicated loan  a million prepayment of the remaining outstanding debt with the coca cola financial corporation us  a million reduction in the debt held by our venezuelan subsidiary and a million reduction in the debt of our brazilian subsidiary  offset by issuance of million of debt in our other subsidiaries 
approximately million of debt in our mexican operations carry a standard poor s rating of mx aa and approximately million of debt in our colombian operations carry a duff phelps rating of aaa 
net debt decreased to million at the end of from  million at the end of during december  the company entered into a debt agreement for million mexican pesos us million at december   maturing in with semiannual principal payments and bearing interest at the day tiie interbank equilibrium rate of mexico plus at december  during february and august  the company issued unsecured marketable bonds denominated in colombian pesos for a total of col billion us million at december   with five year maturities and annual interest rates ranging from dtf the colombian borrowing rate plus to dtf plus ranging from to  respectively  at december our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows see the financial statements payments due by period less than total year years years after years bank loans and long term obligations      capital lease obligations     operating leases      other contractual obligations     on december   the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program of the company s class a common stock the share repurchase program in accordance with the anti market manipulation safe harbor of rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act of the share repurchase program was supplemented with million increases on each of july  and september  in addition to this million authority  the share repurchase program also provides for repurchases of shares from independent brokers by panamco currently totaling million made in connection with employees stock option exercises 
panamco shares may be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
during  we repurchased  shares amounting to including brokerage commissions 
in march  the board of directors increased the share repurchase program by million 
from the share repurchase program s inception on december  to december   we have repurchased  shares for a total amount of million including brokerage commissions 
on march   molson  inc announced the acquisition of kaiser  in which the company holds a ownership interest 
the transaction is valued at million 
the company expects that it will receive gross proceeds of approximately million from this transaction 
a small portion of the proceeds will be received in molson shares  with the remaining amount to be received in cash within the next days 
at the present time  we distribute kaiser products in our franchise area and the molson  inc acquisition will not impact our distribution agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business exposes us to many different market risks  such as fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
consequently  we consider risk management as an essential activity in the course of our business 
we utilize hedging strategies to mitigate those risks 
our hedging strategies may include the use of derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures and options  generally with terms not exceeding one year 
while it is not the policy of panamco to enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes  occasionally  panamco may continue holding a derivative instrument for speculative purposes if other business goals and strategies are present at the time 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure generally relates to our debt obligations 
we manage our interest rate exposure by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
therefore  our exposure to an increase in interest rates results from our floating rate debt and our exposure to a decrease in interest rates relates to the financing costs associated with our fixed rate debt 
the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in this table  the fair value of long term debt shown is based on the quoted market prices  or  when quoted market prices were not available  the present value of future cash flows expected maturity date there after total fv total fv interest rate risk amounts in equivalent millions of us dollars fixed rate debt in us dollars weighted average interest rate in brazilian reals weighted average interest rate in guatemalan quetzals weighted average interest rate in colombian pesos weighted average interest rate in mexican udis weighted average interest rate floating rate debt in us dollars weighted average interest rate in colombian pesos weighted average interest rate in mexican pesos weighted average interest rate in brazilian reals weighted average interest rate in costa rican colon weighted average interest rate total debt    less bank loans total long term debt fixed interest rates are weighted averages as contracted by us 
floating interest rates are based on market rates as of december   plus the weighted average spread for us 
fv fair value market interest rates are based on the us dollar libor curve 
market rates are based on the country benchmark or libor and assume a flat yield curve 
panamco had a floating to fixed interest rate swap the swap  expiring in november  with a total notional amount outstanding at december  of million  which exchanges libor for a fixed interest rate of 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 panamco designated the swap as a cash flow hedge 
during  panamco determined that it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not continue through the expiration of the swap 
therefore  panamco reclassified million of unrealized losses related to the swap from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense  net in panamco s statement of operations 
the fair value of the swap was million as of december  foreign exchange risk our currency exchange risk is generally related to the potential devaluation of the us dollar against the latin american currencies used in the countries in which we have operations 
in each country where we operate  our sales are in local currencies  while our debt is mostly in us dollars 
therefore  foreign currency exchange exposure relates primarily to our debt obligations in us dollars  which are shown in the previous interest rate risk table 
to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates fluctuations  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions in order to lock in the exchange rates for anticipated transactions 
on december   panamco entered into foreign currency forward purchase contracts  expiring in  with total notional amounts of approximately million  which exchange brazilian reales for us dollars 
as of december   the fair value of these foreign currency forward purchase contracts was zero 
commodity price risk our largest exposure to commodity price fluctuations is for sugar 
as a risk management practice  we may utilize both futures and options contracts to hedge against an increase in the price of sugar 
as of december   although we did not hold a material hedging position for sugar  panamco had call options outstanding to purchase  metric tons of sugar for a total cost of thousand 
the fair value of these options was thousand as of december  because inventories of sugar are of a short term nature  they are not included in this market risk disclosure
