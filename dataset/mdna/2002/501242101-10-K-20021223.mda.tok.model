item business 
we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions and service  maintain  repair and upgrade assembly equipment 
we also provide semiconductor wafer solder bumping interconnect flip chip bumping services for sale to companies that manufacture and assemble semiconductor devices and license our flip chip bumping process 
today  we are the world s largest supplier of semiconductor assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into four segments equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and advanced packaging technology 
historically  the demand for semiconductors and our semiconductor assembly equipment has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
for instance  a strong upturn in the semiconductor industry for the majority of fiscal resulted in record revenues and earnings in that year 
this industry upturn was followed by a severe industry downturn in fiscal and fiscal during which time we reported significant reductions in sales and record net losses 
in response to the downturn  we started to reduce the size of the company in fiscal and  because of the severity of the downturn  continued this resizing in fiscal  in order to more closely align our cost structure to anticipated revenue levels 
after an unsustained up tick in our business in the spring of the business turned down again causing us to announce a series of additional operational changes which were designed to reduce our overall cost base  in part  by focusing our efforts on our larger more established product lines 
as part of these changes  in august we announced the closure of our substrate business and in november we announced that we are exploring options for our saw  wafer and hard material blade and flip chip businesses  including their potential sale 
the severe industry downturn in fiscal and is continuing and is expected to negatively impact our business at least in the first half of fiscal we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that can provide customers with semiconductor assembly equipment along with a broad range of complimentary packaging materials and test interconnect solutions all of which are optimized for specific customer applications

table of contents products and services we offer a broad range of semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and flip chip bumping services and spare parts used in the semiconductor assembly process 
set forth below is a table listing the net sales and percentage of our total net sales for each business segment for our fiscal years ended september   and fiscal year ended september  net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales dollars in thousands equipment packaging materials test interconnect advanced packaging technologies in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired two test interconnect companies  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation 
as the above chart indicates  our equipment sales are highly volatile based on the semiconductor industry cycle whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales tend to be more run rate driven 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
equipment our principal equipment product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads on the die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we offer both ball and wedge bonders in automatic and manual configurations 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages based on high productivity and superior process control  enabling fine pitch bonding and long  low wire loops  which are needed to assemble advanced ic packages 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase productivity and process capability compared to its predecessor 
in may  we began marketing the max m  our latest generation ic ball bonder  which offers up to more productivity than the model pps  its predecessor 
in addition  we introduced the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder designed for low lead applications  a segment of the market we had not previously targeted 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for processing large panels used for hybrids  chip on board and multi chip modules  the waferpro  for wafer level bumping for flip chip and other area array applications  the triton rda ribbon deep access  a wedge bonder designed for ribbon bonding  the model and model  wedge bonders  and the series of manual wire bonders 
as part of an ongoing strategy to reduce the cost of our wire bonders  we transferred our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from willow grove  pennsylvania to singapore in fiscal and started to move our supply chain to china in fiscal in addition to wire bonders  we also produce a range of saws for applications including wafer dicing  package singulation and for cutting other hard materials 
we believe that our knowledge and experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific services that reduce the cost of owning our equipment 
historically  our offerings in this area were limited to spare parts  customer training and extended warranty contracts 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we are focusing on providing repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through a customer operations group 

table of contents packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of packaging materials to semiconductor device assemblers  including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in the semiconductor packaging process 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
our principal packaging materials are bonding wire 
we manufacture very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications 
expendable tools 
our family of expendable tools includes capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades 
capillaries and wedges are used to feed out  attach and cut the wires used in wire bonding 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages 
our hubless saw blades are used to cut hard and brittle materials and for package singulation 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily connect automatic test equipment to the semiconductor device under test during wafer fabrication wafer probing and after the device has been assembled and packaged package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
probe cards consist of a complex  multilayer printed circuit board pcb and numerous probes designed to make temporary electrical connections to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while it is still in a wafer format 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
ate interface assemblies  typically consisting of mechanical docking hardware and two intricate  multilayer pcbs  mechanically connect the ate to the wafer prober and carry the electrical signal to the semiconductor device under test 
ate test boards 
ate test boards are complex  multilayer pcbs that mount directly to the ate and transfer the electrical signal from the ate to the test socket contactor 
test sockets contactors 
test sockets contactors consist of numerous miniaturized spring loaded contacts that touch down on the electrical contacts of a packaged semiconductor 
changes in the design of a semiconductor require changes in the probe card  test socket contactor and  in certain cases  the ate test board used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 
examples of the new families of probe cards we have introduced include the p  duraplus and speedtip 
advanced packaging technologies our flip chip business unit focuses primarily on licensing its flip chip technology and providing flip chip bumping and wafer level packaging services to customers 
in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronic corporation delco to license flip chip technology and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis 
in march  we purchased all of delco s interest in the flip chip venture not previously owned by us 
we own of flip chip 
we are currently providing contract bump services to approximately customers 
we also developed and market a wafer level package  named the ultracsp  which is in production and has been licensed to customers 
in september  we introduced spheron  a wafer level package technology that expands the capability and performance of our wafer level package product 
as of september   we had sold nine licenses for wafer solder bumping and wafer level packaging applications  and we expect to sell additional licenses in the future 
our flip chip business unit has not been profitable to date 

table of contents in january  we acquired the advanced substrate technology of micromodule systems  a cupertino  california company  to enable production of high density substrates referred to as our substrate business unit 
this business unit  while showing some progress in developing substrate technology  was not profitable 
in august  we announced our intention to close this business 
customers our major customers include large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
some of these major customers are advanced micro devices advanced semiconductor engineering agere amkor technologies chippac conexant general dynamics infineon technologies intel international business machines lsi logic micron motorola national semiconductor nec international orient semiconductor electronics philips electronics samsung seagate siliconware precision industries co  ltd st microelectronics texas instruments a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our net sales 
in fiscal  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of net sales 
in fiscal  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering accounted for of our net sales and sales to amkor technologies accounted for of our net sales 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
we believe that developing long term relationships with our customers is critical to our success 
by establishing these relationships with semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  we gain insight into our customers future ic packaging strategies 
this information assists us in our efforts to develop material  equipment and process solutions that address our customers future assembly requirements 
international operations we sell our products to semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales and of our fiscal net sales were for delivery to customer locations outside of the united states 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  and the philippines 
our shipments to customers in china have historically been a small portion of our sales  however  we expect this portion to increase as some of our customers increase their production capacity in china 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
we maintain substantial manufacturing operations in countries other than the united states  including operations located in singapore and israel and other smaller facilities in france  japan  scotland  switzerland and taiwan 
we are currently building a significant facility in suzhou  china 
risks associated with our international operations include risks of foreign currency and foreign financial market fluctuations  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments  war  civil disturbances  expropriation  and other events that may limit or disrupt markets 
sales and customer support we operate a single sales management team to coordinate activities and improve customer support 
we rely on a combination of a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors for the sale of all product lines 
we believe that providing comprehensive worldwide sales  service  training and support are important competitive factors in 
table of contents the semiconductor equipment industry  and we have combined these functions into a customer operations group 
in order to support our customers  whose semiconductor assembly operations are located primarily outside of the united states  we have service and support personnel based in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and europe and applications labs in singapore  japan  israel and taiwan 
our local presence enables us to provide more timely customer service and support by positioning our service representatives and spare parts near customer facilities  and affords customers the ability to place orders locally and to deal with service and support personnel who speak the customer s language and are familiar with local country practices 
backlog at september   our backlog of orders approximated million  compared to approximately million at september  our backlog consists of customer orders which are scheduled for shipment within months 
virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenues for any succeeding quarterly period 
manufacturing equipment 
our assembly equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of integrating components and subassemblies to create finished systems configured to customer specifications 
during fiscal  we performed system design  assembly and testing in house at our willow grove  pennsylvania  singapore and haifa  israel facilities  utilizing an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of many of our major subassemblies 
we believe that outsourcing enables us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control 
our just in time inventory management strategy has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and limited our on hand inventory 
we have obtained iso certification for our equipment manufacturing facilities in willow grove  pennsylvania  singapore and haifa  israel 
packaging materials 
we manufacture bonding tools and hard material blades in facilities in yokneam  israel and bonding wire  consisting of gold  aluminum and copper wire  at facilities in singapore and thalwil  switzerland

our flip chip manufacturing facility has received qs certification 
research and product development because technological change occurs rapidly in the semiconductor industry  we devote substantial resources to our research and development programs in order to maintain our competitiveness 
we pursue the continuous improvement and enhancement of existing products while simultaneously developing next generation products 
as part of our development of next generation products  in fiscal we demonstrated mm process capability for our flip chip bumping technology  we qualified our flip chip wafer probe cards for micron pitch testing and began shipping the max m our latest generation of automatic ball bonders which provide up to more productivity than the model pps ball bonder and supports micron production level process capability and we introduced the nu tek a new automatic wire bonder designed for low lead applications  a segment of the market we had not previously targeted 
we also continued the development of wire bonding products and test capabilities to achieve micron production processes 

table of contents a next generation of wire bonders is being developed which will continue to provide our customers with significant technology and cost of ownership advantages 
much of the next generation equipment we are presently developing is based on modular  interchangeable control subsystems 
this promotes more efficient and cost effective manufacturing operations  lower inventory levels  improved field service capabilities and reduced product development cycles  and allows us to introduce new products more quickly 
our net expenditures for research and development totaled approximately million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we have received funding from certain customers and government agencies pursuant to contracts or other arrangements for the performance of specified research and development activities 
such amounts are recognized as a reduction of research and development expense when specified activities have been performed 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  such funding totaled approximately thousand  million and million  respectively 
competition the semiconductor equipment  packaging materials  and test interconnect solutions industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include performance  quality  customer support and price 
our major equipment competitors include asm pacific technology  shinkawa and kaijo in wire bonders  disco corporation and tsk in saws 
competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include price  delivery and quality

the test products face competition from a few large international firms as well as many small regional firms 
some competitors include mjc  japan electronic materials  sv probe  formfactor  inc  wentworth laboratories  inc and microprobe in wafer test  and everett charles technologies  loranger international corporation  and gold technologies in package test 
our flip chip competitors include fujitsu  unitive and chipbond in each of the markets we serve  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  a few of which may have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
intellectual property where circumstances warrant  we seek to obtain patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research  engineering and manufacturing activities 
we currently hold a number of united states patents  some of which have foreign counterparts 
we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies 
table of contents disclosed and claimed in the patents 
although the patents we hold or may obtain in the future may be of value  we believe that our success will depend primarily on our engineering  manufacturing  marketing and service skills 
in addition  we believe that much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software 
as long as we rely on trade secrets and unpatented knowledge  including software  to maintain our competitive position  there is no assurance that competitors may not independently develop similar technologies and possibly obtain patents containing claims applicable to our products and processes 
our ability to defend ourselves against these claims may be limited 
in addition  although we execute non disclosure and non competition agreements with certain of our employees  customers  consultants  selected vendors and others  there is no assurance that such secrecy agreements will not be breached 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees 
in addition  we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third party waste disposal sites we use or have used 
these laws could impose liability even if we did not know of  or were not responsible for  the contamination 
we have in the past and will in the future incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
we are not  however  currently aware of any costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters  including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third party waste disposal sites  that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
it is possible  however  that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future 
employees at september   we had  permanent employees and temporary employees worldwide 
the only employees represented by a labor union are the bonding wire employees in singapore 
generally  we believe our employee relations to be good 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to software engineering 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees

introduction we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and a broad range of fixtures used to test semiconductor wafers and devices  as well as apply solder bumps to silicon wafers referred to as flip chip bumping for sale to companies that manufacture and assemble semiconductor devices 
we also service  maintain  repair and upgrade assembly equipment and license our flip chip bumping process technology 
we sell our products to semiconductor device manufacturers and contract manufacturers which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of net sales for fiscal and of net sales for fiscal  and are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
we currently have significant manufacturing operations in the united states  singapore and israel  sales and customer support personnel in the united states  china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan  thailand and europe  and applications labs in the united states  singapore  japan  israel and taiwan 
to further support our international sales and reduce costs  we are building a manufacturing facility in china  and expect to start shipping bonding tools from china in the second quarter of fiscal historically  the demand for semiconductors and our semiconductor assembly equipment has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
for instance  a strong upturn in the semiconductor industry for the majority of fiscal resulted in record revenues and earnings in that year 
this industry upturn was followed by a severe industry downturn in fiscal and fiscal during which time we reported significant reductions in sales and record net losses 
in response to the downturn  we started to reduce the size of the company in fiscal and  because of the severity of the downturn  continued this resizing in fiscal  in order to more closely align our cost structure to anticipated revenue levels 
after an unsustained up tick in our business in the spring of the business turned down again causing us to announce a series of additional operational changes which were designed to reduce our overall cost base  in part  by focusing our efforts on our larger more established product lines 
as part of these changes  in august we announced the closure of our substrate business and in november we announced that we are exploring options for our saw  wafer and hard material blade and flip chip businesses  including their potential sale 
the severe industry downturn in fiscal and is continuing and is expected to negatively impact our business at least in the first half of fiscal our backlog of customer orders at september  was million compared to million at september  
table of contents in february  we implemented a functional organizational structure with certain disciplines combined across product lines 
this replaced a traditional product focused organization and allows for better integration of our various product offerings at a lower cost 
under this model  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  and customer operations operate with responsibility for all product offerings 
this functional realignment supported a parallel decision to establish a supply chain in china for our ball bonder products and to shift a portion of the manufacturing of capillaries  and selected test products to a facility in suzhou  china 
we will begin shipping bonding tools from china in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to incur duplicate operating and transition costs associated with the move of manufacturing to china until such time as the new china facility is fully operational 
as indicated above  in response to the weak industry conditions  we have been resizing our workforce and consolidating facilities throughout most of fiscal to more closely align our cost structure with expected revenue levels 
when the up tick in our business in the second quarter of fiscal did not materialize into an anticipated industry recovery  we re evaluated our businesses in light of two years of weakening industry conditions and projections for a slow recovery and we decided to close our substrate business and cancel a company wide integrated information system and we impaired goodwill and reserved for certain us tax assets 
as a result  we recorded the following charges in fiscal goodwill impairment of million associated with our test and hub blade business units  asset impairment of million primarily due to the cancellation of a company wide integrated information system  the closure of our high density interconnect substrate business and the write off of development and license costs of certain engineering and manufacturing software  million of resizing charges comprised primarily of severance and contractual commitments associated with reductions in workforce and our closed and consolidated businesses  and million of severance associated with workforce reductions in our continuing businesses 
we recorded charges for inventory write downs of million to cost of goods sold  million of which was due to the discontinuance of a product and we recorded a charge of million for the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset consisting primarily of us net operating loss carryforwards and a charge of million to provide for tax expense on repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
in november  we announced that we were evaluating various alternatives for our saw  wafer and hard material blade and flip chip business units  including their potential sale 
we have begun preliminary discussions with potential buyers while concurrently exploring other alternatives 
our business is currently divided into four segments equipment we design  manufacture and market semiconductor assembly equipment 
our principal product line is our family of wire bonders  which are used to connect extremely fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bonding pads on the die and the leads on the ic package to which the die has been bonded 
we are the world s largest manufacturer of wire bonders  according to vlsi research  inc in fiscal  we began shipping the max m our latest generation ic ball bonder  which offers up to more productivity than our prior models 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of packaging materials to semiconductor device assemblers including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in the semiconductor packaging process 
our packaging materials are optimized for use with our wire bonders  to provide leading edge efficiencies and capabilities  as well as with our competitors assembly equipment 
test interconnect our test interconnect solutions provide a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily connect automatic test equipment to the semiconductor device under test during wafer fabrication wafer probing and after they have been assembled and packaged package or final testing 
our products include probe cards  automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies  ate test boards  and test socket contactors 
most of the test interconnect products we 
table of contents offer are custom designed or customized for a specific semiconductor or application 
advanced packaging technology this business segment has reflected the operating results of our flip chip business unit and our high density substrate business unit 
through our flip chip business unit we license flip chip technology and provide wafer bumping services and market a wafer level chip scale package ultracsp 
our flip chip business unit has not been profitable to date 
we established our substrate business unit to develop  manufacture and market high density interconnect substrates using either flip chip or advanced wire bonding interconnection schemes 
this technology yielded positive results but due to its high capital and operating expense requirements we decided to close this operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective october   based upon guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have satisfied any equipment installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue based upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
our standard terms are ex works k s factory  with title transferring to our customer at our loading dock or upon embarkation 
we do have a small percentage of sales with other terms  and revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the related customer purchase order 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
revenue from royalty arrangements and license agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms  generally prorated over the life of the contract or based upon specific deliverables 
our business is subject to contingencies related to customer orders as follows right of return a large portion of our revenue comes from the sale of machines that are used in the semiconductor assembly process 
these items are generally built to order  and often include customization to a customer s specifications 
revenue related to the semiconductor equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
other product sales relate to consumable products  which are sold in high volume quantities  and are generally maintained in low stock at our customer s facility 
as a result  customer returns represent a very small percentage of customer sales on an annual basis 
our policy is to provide an allowance for customer returns based upon our historical experience and management assumptions 
warranties our products are generally shipped with a one year warranty against manufacturer s defects and we do not offer extended warranties in the normal course of our business 
we recognize a liability for estimated warranty expense when revenue for the related product is recognized 
the estimated liability for warranty is based upon historical experience and management estimates of future expenses 
conditions of acceptance sales of our consumable products and bonding wire generally do not have customer acceptance terms 
in certain cases  sales of our equipment products do have customer acceptance clauses which generally require that the equipment perform in accordance with specifications during an on site factory inspection by the customer  as well as when installed at the customer s facility 
in such cases  if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our facility prior to shipment  the revenue for the equipment will be recognized upon shipment 
if the customer must first install the equipment in their own factory  then generally  revenue associated with that sale is not recognized until acceptance is received from the customer 

table of contents price protection we do not provide price protection to our customers 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recorded revenue upon the shipment of products or the performance of services 
provisions for estimated product returns  warranty and installation costs were accrued in the period in which the revenue was recognized 
this policy assumed customer acceptance when the product specifications were met and the products shipped 
product returns and disputes with customers due to dissatisfaction with the performance of our products have been immaterial  accordingly  we recognized revenue upon the transfer of title and did not require our customers to provide notice of acceptance 
generally accepted accounting principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas involving the use of estimates in these financial statements include allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  carrying value and lives of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which are the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require judgements and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are also subject to concentrations of customers and sales to a few geographic locations  which may also impact the collectability of certain receivables 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of our operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
our average write off of bad debts over the past five fiscal years has been less than of net sales 
inventory reserves 
we generally provide reserves for equipment inventory and spare part and consumable inventories considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to our suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
if required  we reduce the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or market value  based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the next cyclical market upturn 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we review and dispose of excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
long lived assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets is based upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that our current estimates of future cash flows from our test and hub blade business could not support the carrying value of their assets and accordingly recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million in the test business unit and million in the hub blade business 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in accordance with sfas deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such 
table of contents determination was made 
in fiscal we recognized a million charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset consisting primarily of us net operating loss carryforwards 
overview net sales 
our equipment sales depend on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and technology driven advancements in semiconductor design 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile  and has experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns  which have had a severe negative effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment 
for example  a downturn in the semiconductor industry in fiscal and contributed to a reduction in our net sales of in fiscal and a further reduction in net sales of in fiscal our packaging materials sales depend on manufacturing expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers  many of which also purchase our equipment products 
however  the volatility in demand for our packaging materials is less than that of our equipment sales due to the consumable nature of these products 
our test interconnect solutions sales depend on the manufacturing expenditures of some of the same semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as our equipment and packaging materials sales 
because of the consumable and customized nature of most of our test products  however  the volatility in demand for these test products is less than that of our equipment sales 
our advanced packaging technology sales represent the sales from our flip chip business unit 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net sales from each business segment for the past three years fiscal year ended september  net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales dollars in thousands equipment packaging materials test interconnect advanced packaging technologies in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired two test interconnect companies  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation 
as the above chart indicates  our equipment sales are highly volatile based on the semiconductor industry cycle whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales tend to be more run rate driven 
cost of goods sold 
our equipment cost of goods sold consists mainly of subassemblies  materials  direct and indirect labor costs and other overhead 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
packaging materials cost of goods sold consists primarily of gold  aluminum  direct labor and other materials used in the manufacture of bonding wire  capillaries  wedges and other company products  with gold making up the majority of the cost 
gold bonding wire is generally priced based on a fabrication charge per  feet of wire  plus the value of the gold 
to minimize our exposure to gold price fluctuations  we obtain gold for fabrication under a contract with our gold supplier on consignment and only purchase the gold when we ship the finished product to the customer 
accordingly  fluctuations in the price of gold are generally absorbed by our gold supplier or passed on to our customers 
since gold makes up a significant portion of the cost of goods sold of the bonding wire business unit  the gross profit margins of that 
table of contents business unit and therefore the packaging materials segment will be lower than can be expected in the equipment business 
we rely on one supplier for our gold requirements 
test interconnect cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  indirect labor for engineering design and materials used in the manufacture of wafer and ic package testing cards and devices 
cost of goods sold in our advanced packaging technology segment is comprised of material  labor and overhead at our flip chip division 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense is comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  professional costs  and depreciation expense 
research and development expense 
our research and development costs consist primarily of labor  prototype material and other costs associated with our developmental efforts to strengthen our product lines and develop new products and depreciation expense 
for example  in fiscal  we began shipping the max m  our next generation automatic ball bonder and introduced the nu tek a new automatic wire bonder designed for low lead applications  a segment of the market we had not previously targeted 
included in research and development expense is the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
our research and development costs decreased in fiscal as a result of the resizing of our business 
however  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs as we introduce and complete the development of next generation bonding process solutions 
results of operations the table below shows principal line items from our historical consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of our net sales  for the three years ended september fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development  net resizing asset impairment goodwill impairment amortization of goodwill and intangibles purchased in process research and development income loss from operations fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september  we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 

table of contents sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were million  down from million in fiscal the decrease in sales reflects the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  which significantly impacted sales of our semiconductor assembly equipment and test products 
fiscal sales in the equipment segment were down  due to lower average selling prices for our automatic ball bonders and lower sales of dicing systems and tab bonders  partially offset by higher unit sales of automatic ball bonders 
net sales in the packaging materials segment were up  due to higher demand for gold wire and capillaries primarily in the fourth quarter 
net sales in the advanced packaging segment were down from the prior year due to lower bumping revenue and license fees at flip chip 
sales for the test division were down for the fiscal year  however  test sales for fiscal included only the months from the dates of acquisition through september  international sales shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of our total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  and the philippines 
our shipments to customers in china have historically been a small portion of our sales  however we expect this portion to increase as some of our customers increase their production capacity in china 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline was due primarily to lower average selling prices for automatic ball bonders and lower unit sales of dicing systems and tab bonders in the equipment segment and lower sales volume at flip chip in the advanced packaging segment 
partially offsetting the above mentioned declines in gross profit was higher unit sales of automatic ball bonders and packaging materials and higher gross profit in the test segment 
included in the results for fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million 
these charges for inventory write downs include three distinct components 
the largest component of the charge  amounting to approximately million  relates to the write down of spare parts inventories 
we decided in the second quarter of fiscal to outsource our spare parts inventory management and accordingly wrote down excess inventory 
the second component of the charge relates to the write down of million of inventory associated with the discontinuance of our model dual spindle saw 
annual revenue for this product over the past several fiscal years has been insignificant therefore  the discontinuance of this product is not expected to have a material impact on sales  gross profit or net income 
the smallest portion of the charge  amounting to million  related to our normal excess and obsolescence reviews that are a recurring part of our normal business and ongoing operations 
we provide reserves for equipment inventory and for spare parts and consumables inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
we review and dispose of our excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
in fiscal  we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs in fiscal primarily involve items that are not part of our continuing product offerings and accordingly  should not have a significant impact on our future business or profitability 
included in the results for fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million to costs of goods sold 
we recorded million of the charge in the first quarter for excess and obsolete ball bonder inventory and million in the second quarter for ball bonder and spare parts inventory 
in the fourth quarter we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete ball bonder  dicing saw  test fixture and spare parts inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs resulted from the severe and continued downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in fiscal  we also recorded an acquisition related inventory step up charge of million 
in fiscal  we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin for the year was due primarily to lower average selling prices of automatic ball bonders and dicing systems and a negative gross profit at flip chip 
gross margin  excluding inventory write downs  would have been in fiscal and  excluding inventory write downs and the acquisition charge  would have been in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal sg a expenses 
table of contents include approximately million of expenses which are not comparable to the fiscal expenses 
the million of non comparable expense include million of severance expense  million for two additional months of expenses at the test division months of operations in vs 
only ten months and million of training and start up expense associated with our new china facility 
excluding these charges  our fiscal sg a expense would have declined million or primarily reflecting reduced compensation and outside services expenses from our resizing initiatives taken in the current and prior year 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal the lower r d spending was due to a shift in certain engineering functions to lower cost foreign subsidiaries  and the push out of certain future product development initiatives 
our r d expense includes the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
resizing costs 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
the industry has experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment for the past two years 
we have developed resizing plans in response to these changes in our business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and facility consolidations 
accounting for resizing activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
although we make every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
historically  the demand for semiconductors and our semiconductor assembly equipment has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
for instance  a strong upturn in the semiconductor industry for the majority of fiscal resulted in record revenues and earnings in that year 
this industry upturn was followed by a severe industry downturn in fiscal and fiscal during which time we reported significant reductions in sales and record net losses 
in response to the downturn  we started to reduce the size of the company in fiscal and  because of the severity of the downturn  continued this resizing in fiscal  in order to more closely align our cost structure to anticipated revenue levels 
after an unsustained up tick in our business in the spring of the business turned down again causing us to announce a series of additional operational changes which were designed to reduce our overall cost base  in part  by focusing our efforts on our larger more established product lines 
as part of these changes  in august we announced the closure of our substrate business and in november we announced that we are exploring options for our saw  wafer and hard material blade and flip chip businesses  including their potential sale 
the severe industry downturn in fiscal and is continuing and is expected to negatively impact our business at least in the first half of fiscal we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal charges in fiscal year fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we would close our substrate operations due to its high capital and operating cash requirements 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge includes a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
while none of the positions were terminated as of september   all but one were terminated in the first quarter of fiscal and the remaining position is expected to be terminated by march  cash payments for the severance charge are expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue until the end of  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 

table of contents the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal fourth quarter charge severance and benefits commitments total in thousands provision for resizing payment of obligations balance  september  third quarter in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in our test division 
the resizing plan was a result of our decision to move towards a hour per day manufacturing model in our major us wafer test facility  which will provide our customers with faster turn around time and delivery of orders and economies of scale in manufacturing 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our gilbert  arizona facility and our austin  texas facility to our san jose  california and dallas  texas facilities and from our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan includes a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
at september   of the positions have been eliminated 
the remaining positions are expected to be terminated by june  the resizing plan also included a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan and austin  texas facilities representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure date and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
both facilities have been closed 
cash payments for the severance charge are expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility obligations are expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal third quarter charge severance and benefits commitments total in thousands provision for resizing payment of obligations balance  september  second quarter in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan comprised of a functional realignment of business management and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities 
in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including our hub blade business and the move of the company s microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to move our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china and our microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
while we believe our cost structure would be reduced by transitioning production from the united states to less expensive sites in asia  we have decided that the immediate costs associated with transition and training should be deferred 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of 
table of contents million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifts management of our businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
in the second quarter  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore  whose operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit date that is associated with these closed test facilities 
at september   four positions remain to be terminated and are expected to be terminated by december  cash payments for the severance charge are expected to be complete by march  but cash payments for the facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those originally estimated

as a result  we recorded a resizing charge for severance of million for the elimination of positions across all levels of the organization  all of which were terminated prior to march  in connection with our acquisition of probe tech  we also recorded an increase to goodwill for million for severance  lease and other facility charges related to the elimination of four leased probe tech facilities in the united states which were found to be duplicative with the cerprobe facilities 
the plans have been completed and there will be no additional cash payments related to severance under this program

in addition to the workforce resizings and the facility consolidations  we terminated several of our major initiatives in an effort to more closely align our cost structure with expected revenue levels 
as a result  we recorded asset impairment charges of million in fiscal we also recorded an asset impairment of thousand in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment of million 
the charge included million associated with the cancellation of a company wide integrated information system  an million write off of assets associated with the closure of the substrates operation and million of assets associated with a closed wire facility in taiwan 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
the write off included a million charge for the write off of development and license costs of certain engineering and manufacturing software  
table of contents which had not yet been completed or placed in service and would never be utilized 
also in the second quarter  we wrote off million related to leasehold improvements at the leased probe card manufacturing facilities in malaysia and the united states  which have been closed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the closure of a wire facility in the united states and the disposition of the associated equipment 
goodwill impairment 
effective october   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intangible assets that are classified as goodwill and those with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized under the provisions of this standard 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life 
the standard also requires that an impairment test be performed to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at least annually 
we reviewed our business and determined that there are five reporting units to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the standard the reporting units were the bonding wire  hub blade  substrate  flip chip and test business 
the bonding wire and hub blade businesses are included in our packaging materials segment  the substrate and flip chip businesses are included in our advanced packaging segment and the test business comprises our test segment 
there is no goodwill associated with our equipment segment 
upon adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the required transitional impairment testing of intangible assets  and based upon those analyses  did not identify any impairment charges as a result of adoption of this standard effective october  we have determined that our annual test for impairment of intangible assets will take place at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
due to the severity and the length of the current industry downturn and uncertainty of the timing of improvement in industry conditions we have revised our earnings forecasts for each of our business units that were tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we discontinued our substrate business and wrote off intangible assets of million and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million in our test reporting unit and a goodwill impairment loss of million in our hub blade reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the following table presents pro forma net earnings and earnings per share data reflecting the impact of adoption of sfas as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended september  in thousands  except per share data reported net loss  before adoption of sfas addback goodwill amortization  net of tax pro forma net loss net loss per share  as reported basic diluted goodwill amortization  net of tax per share basic diluted pro forma net loss per share basic diluted 
table of contents amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower amortization expense in fiscal was primarily the result of our adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets effective october   which resulted in the elimination of amortization on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life the agreement governing our purchase of probe tech from siegel robert corp 
included a provision for reducing the purchase price if probe tech s actual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda were less than a projected amount 
we disputed probe tech s ebitda calculation and initiated arbitration seeking a reduction in the purchase price 
the arbitrator s award reduced the purchase price by million in the second quarter of fiscal in june  we received the final settlement and reduced goodwill by million  reflecting the award  less costs incurred in the arbitration 
purchased in process research and development in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for in process r d associated with the acquisitions of cerprobe and probe tech representing the appraised value of products still in the development stage that did not have a future alternative use and which had not reached technological feasibility 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired ongoing r d projects  all aimed at increasing the technological features of the existing probe cards and therefore the number of test applications for which they could be marketed 
the r d projects ranged from researching the feasibility of producing multi die testing probes to researching the feasibility of producing probes for specialized semiconductor package csp and bga configurations 
the project stage of completion ranged from to and all projects were due for completion and product launch by the third quarter of at prices and costs similar to the existing probe cards marketed by cerprobe and probe tech 
in the valuation of in process technology  we utilized a variation of the income approach 
we forecast revenue  earnings and cash flow for the products under development 
revenues were projected to extend out over the expected useful lives for each project 
the technology was then valued through the application of the discounted cash flow method 
values were calculated using the present value of their projected future cash flow at discount rates of between and 
we anticipated that some of these projects might take longer to develop than originally thought and that some of these projects may never be marketable and there is a risk that the anticipated future cash flows might not be achieved 
of the ongoing r d projects at the time of the acquisition four have been completed  four are still in progress  four have been cancelled due to overlapping technology with our cobra line of vertical test products  and four were cancelled due to nonproductive results 
we believe that the expected returns of the completed and in process r d projects will be realized 
we also believe that future revenues from our existing cobra products will offset the expected future revenues from the r d projects that were cancelled due to the overlapping technology and that there will be no adverse material impact on the company s future operating results or the expected return on its investment in the acquired companies 
the four projects that were cancelled due to lack of productive results will not have a material impact on our future operating results and expected return on our investment in the acquired companies 

table of contents the major r d projects in process at the time of the acquisition  along with their current status and estimated time for completion are as follows r d project value assigned at purchase percentage complete at purchase estimated cost to complete project at purchase projected product launch date current status of project dollars in thousands next generation contact technology q in process socket tesing capability for csp and bga packages n a complete viprobe pitch reduction n a cancelled vertical space transformer n a cancelled extension of p technology to vertical test configuations n a cancelled low force  high density interface using p technology n a cancelled all other projects combined total of ten projects q q complete  in process  cancelled we purchased two companies  cerprobe corporation cerprobe and probe technology corporation probe tech that design and manufacture semiconductor test interconnect solutions  in our fiscal year subsequent to the acquisitions  we determined that the vertical probe technology designed and marketed by probe tech was superior to the vertical probe technology of cerprobe 
we then shifted our r d efforts to further enhancement of the probe tech vertical probe technology and cancelled the r d projects at cerprobe that were enhancing the cerprobe vertical probe technology 
the r d projects identified by in the above table were cerprobe projects that were cancelled due to the shift in focus to the probe tech vertical probe technology 
we expect the future revenue from the probe tech vertical probe technology will replace the anticipated revenue from the cerprobe vertical probe r d projected that have been cancelled 
the value assigned at purchase reflects the present value of the projected future cash flow generated from the sale of products created by each r d project from its launch date through the expected life of the product 
income loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended september  was million compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year 
the operating loss was due primarily to the lower sales and associated gross profit  resizing costs and the goodwill and asset impairment charges partially offset by lower sg a expenses 
interest 
interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in the prior year 
the lower interest income was due primarily to lower interest rates on short term investments 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the higher interest expense in fiscal was due to a full years interest on the convertible subordinated notes due that were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents other income and minority interest 
other income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal are primarily associated with the cash settlement of an insurance claim associated with a fire in our bonding tools facility 
other income also includes minority interest of thousand in fiscal for the portion of the loss of a foreign test division subsidiary that was owned by a third party 
we purchased the third party s interest in fiscal other income in includes minority interest of thousand in the foreign test division subsidiary and delco s interest in the loss incurred at flip chip prior to our purchases of all remaining outstanding flip chip equity units 
tax expense 
we recognized tax expense of million in fiscal compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was due primarily to a million charge to establish a valuation allowance against our us net operating loss carryforwards  a million charge to provide for tax expense on repatriation of certain foreign earnings and foreign income taxes of million 
these charges were partially offset by a benefit of million from the pretax loss in the us cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in fiscal  we adopted sab and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of taxes of million 
the cumulative effect represents the net income associated with million of sales that were deferred upon adoption of the standard 
we recognized million of the million of deferred sales in fiscal and million in fiscal at september   deferred revenue was approximately million 
net loss 
our net loss for fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 
fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september  we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal bookings reflected the significant downturn in the semiconductor industry  which severely reduced overall demand for semiconductor assembly equipment and associated packaging and test products 
at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
sales 
net sales for the year ended september  were million  down from the million reported for fiscal the decrease in sales for the year reflects the downturn in the semiconductor industry  which significantly impacted sales of our semiconductor assembly equipment  and to a lesser extent  sales of our consumable products 
the lower sales were partially offset by sales from our newly acquired test interconnect business unit 
in fiscal  we adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which resulted in a change in our revenue recognition policy relating to certain customer sales 
net sales for the year of million included revenue of million for sales that were previously reported in the prior fiscal year but were deferred upon adoption of the standard effective october  the fiscal quarterly results presented in this annual report have been restated to give effect to the adoption of the standard as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
fiscal sales in the equipment segment were down  due primarily to lower unit sales of automatic ball bonders 
net sales in the packaging materials segment were down  due to reduced demand for gold wire and capillaries 
sales for the test division were million for the period from the dates of acquisition through september  higher bumping service revenues and license income at our flip chip business unit contributed to a increase in net sales for our advanced packaging segment 
international sales shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised and of our total sales during fiscal and  respectively 
the lower percentage of international sales in fiscal was due primarily to the sales of the newly acquired test interconnect segment which are more concentrated in the united states 
sales to customers in the asia pacific region  including korea  taiwan  malaysia  the philippines  japan  singapore  thailand and hong kong accounted for approximately and of our total sales in fiscal and  
table of contents respectively 
during fiscal  shipments to customers located in taiwan  singapore  malaysia and the philippines accounted for   and as compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to the lower volume of equipment and packaging material sales 
the fiscal gross profit also reflected a write down of million to costs of goods sold for excess and obsolete inventory 
in fiscal  we recorded million of the charge in the first quarter for excess and obsolete ball bonder inventory and million in the second quarter for ball bonder and spare parts inventory 
in the fourth quarter we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete ball bonder  dicing saw  test fixture and spare parts inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs resulted from the severe and continued downturn in the semiconductor industry 
we provide reserves for equipment  spare part and consumables inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and review of consumable inventory levels at its customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
we review and dispose of our excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
in fiscal  we also recorded an acquisition related inventory step up charge of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales referred to as gross margin in fiscal decreased to from in the prior year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was due primarily to lower gross margin in the equipment segment due to a higher average cost of production resulting from inefficiencies from manufacturing fewer machines than in the prior year 
the gross margin in fiscal was also negatively impacted by a lower gross margin at our newly acquired test division than our equipment and packaging materials businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses for the full year was due to million of sg a expenses incurred in the test division  from the dates of acquisition through september   and additional amortization expense of million associated with the acquisition of the test division 
excluding these additional expenses associated with the test division  sg a expense was million or below the prior year due partially to salary and headcount reductions and other cost containment actions initiated in fiscal research and development 
because technological change occurs rapidly in the semiconductor industry  we devote substantial resources to our research and development r d programs to maintain our technological leadership 
this commitment to new product introductions and product development resulted in an increase in r d expense of million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the result of million of r d expenses associated with the test division from the dates of acquisition through september  and r d expenses at our substrate business unit 
resizing costs and asset impairment 
fourth quarter in the quarter ended september   we announced a resizing plan to close a bonding wire facility in the united states  and recorded a resizing charge for severance of million for the elimination of positions  all of which had been terminated at september  also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an increase to goodwill of million in connection with the acquisition of probe tech for additional lease costs associated with the elimination of four duplicate facilities in the united states 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charge are expected to continue through 
table of contents the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal severance and benefits commitments total in thousands fourth quarter charge provision for resizing acquisition restructuring payment of obligations balance  september  second quarter in the quarter ended march   we announced a reduction in our workforce 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge for severance of million for the elimination of positions across all levels of the organization  all of which were terminated prior to march  in connection with our acquisition of probe tech  we also recorded an increase to goodwill for million for severance  lease and other facility charges related to the elimination of four leased probe tech facilities in the united states which were found to be duplicative with the cerprobe facilities 
the plans have been completed and there will be no additional cash payments related to severance under this program 
cash payments for the facility obligations are expected to continue until december  or such time as the obligation can be satisfied 
the resizing costs were included in accrued liabilities 
the table below details the spending and activity related to the resizing program plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal severance and benefits commitments total in thousands second quarter charge provision for resizing acquisition restructuring payment of obligations balance  september  fiscal in fiscal  we reversed into income million of the million reserve which we established in fiscal for the relocation of our automatic ball bonder manufacturing from willow grove  pennsylvania to singapore 
the reserve was established to reflect provisions for severance and asset write off costs resulting from the move 
however  due to the significant increase in demand for microelectronics products  in fiscal  the company retained engineering and marketing positions which were planned for downsizing 
in addition  the majority of the direct and indirect manufacturing positions were eliminated through attrition in the workforce 
the decision to retain the engineering and marketing positions in the us and attrition in the workforce reduced the amount of severance required to be paid compared to the original estimate and resulted in the reversal of million of the reserve 
the relocation activities were completed in fiscal purchased in process research and development 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for in process r d associated with the acquisitions of cerprobe and probe tech representing the appraised value of products still in the development stage that did not have a future alternative use and which had not reached technological feasibility see discussion on pages and of this report 

table of contents income loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended september  was million compared to income from operations of million for the prior year 
the operating loss was due primarily to the lower sales and associated gross profit  additional expenses associated with the acquisitions  higher r d expenses  inventory write downs and resizing costs 
interest 
to fund the cerprobe and probe tech acquisitions  we increased our borrowings and reduced our investment portfolio in the latter portion of the first quarter 
this resulted in higher interest expense for fiscal and lower interest income for the same period  as compared to fiscal we also issued million of convertible subordinated notes in august of  which increased our net interest expense in fiscal part of the proceeds from this offering were used to repay and terminate our then existing revolving credit facility 
other income 
results for fiscal include other income of million associated with the cash settlement of an insurance claim associated with a fire in our bonding tools facility 
in fiscal  we also recorded minority interest in a foreign probe tech subsidiary from the date of our acquisition of probe tech and delco s interest in the loss incurred at flip chip prior to our purchases of all remaining outstanding flip chip equity units of thousand 
in fiscal  other income consists entirely of minority interest in the loss incurred at flip chip of million equity in loss of joint ventures 
in fiscal  we recorded losses of million on our equity interest in advanced polymer solutions  llc aps  a joint venture with polyset company  inc the joint venture was dissolved in september tax expense 
our effective tax rate for fiscal is  compared to in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal is due primarily to the mix of foreign earnings  offset by tax benefits associated with losses from united states based operations 
in fiscal we did not record an income tax benefit on the million charge for in process research and development 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in fiscal  we adopted sab the cumulative effect represents the net income associated with million of sales that were deferred upon adoption of the standard

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements sfas in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the standard provides guidance for financial reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessors 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
sfas in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supersedes fasb  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement applies to all long lived assets and requires that the assets to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
sfas in april  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in rescinding fasb statement no 
and fasb no 
 fasb eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect  however  an entity would not be prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items so long as they meet the criteria of paragraph of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
further  the statement amends sfas to eliminate an inconsistency between the accounting for sale leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the standard will be effective for transactions occurring after may  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
consolidation of certain special purpose entities in june  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no

the proposed interpretation will apply to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with an spe 
the exposure draft provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a spe  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the fasb expects to issue the interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year we are currently reviewing the provisions of this exposure draft but do not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in may  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation that would require a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the proposed interpretation would also require a company the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the proposed interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent measurement of the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee

implementation of this exposure draft  when and if it becomes a final accounting rule would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  and would be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the proposed interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations 
changes in accounting principles and policies accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
the standard requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive income  based on whether the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
the cumulative effect of adoption was not material 
the impact of sfas no 
on our future results will be dependent upon the fair values of our derivatives and related financial instruments and could result in increased volatility 
revenue recognition 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective october   based upon guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have completed our equipment installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue based upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
revenue from royalty arrangements and license agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms  generally prorated over the life of the contract or based upon specific deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance provided in sab  the deferred revenue balance as of october  was million 
this amount consists of equipment that was shipped and recorded as revenue in fiscal but had not met the customer acceptance criteria required by sab in fiscal  we recorded an after tax non cash charge of million or per fully diluted share  associated with the million of deferred revenue  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
in fiscal  we received customer acceptances for million of the million that was deferred as of the beginning of the fiscal year and accordingly recognized million of revenue 
also in fiscal  we recorded after tax non cash profit of million or per fully diluted share associated with the million of deferred revenue 
at september   deferred revenue was approximately million  which will be recognized in future periods as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
in fiscal  we recognized net sales of million  of the million of sales deferred upon adoption  and million of associated after tax profit 
no additional revenue was deferred during fiscal the unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the quarters ended december   march  and june  have been restated to reflect the application of sab shipping and handling revenues and costs 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the task force concluded that amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling should be classified as revenue 
we adopted the consensus in fiscal  and the impact to the financial statements is immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million  compared to million at september  
table of contents cash used by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the net loss reported in the period 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  the investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of investments  offset by purchases of investments and capital expenditures 
in fiscal we spent million in capital expenditures  million of which was for cost associated with our initiative to implement a company wide integrated information system 
these costs were accounted for in accordance with sop we discontinued this project in the fourth quarter and wrote off the million spent in fiscal as part of a total write off of million associated with this project 
we also spent approximately million on facility upgrades and manufacturing equipment in our test business 
in addition  we announced plans to build a facility in china to manufacture capillaries  selected test products and other products 
we spent million on this china facility in fiscal and expect to spend an additional million over the next years to full develop this facility 
in fiscal  we acquired cerprobe and probe tech and invested million in additional manufacturing capacity at flip chip  our packaging materials businesses and information technology to develop corporate wide e business capabilities 
in november  we completed a tender offer for of the  outstanding shares of cerprobe for per share resulting in a cash purchase price before the assumption of liabilities and transaction costs of million 
in december  we purchased for cash all the outstanding shares of probe tech before the assumption of liabilities and transaction costs for million 
cash used for the acquisitions of cerprobe and probe tech was million and million  respectively  net of cash acquired and the payment of certain acquisition related liabilities 
also in fiscal  we purchased the remaining interest in flip chip that was owned by delco for million 
net cash used by financing activities was thousand in fiscal  primarily for payments on capital lease obligations partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock resulting from employee stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  principally due to the proceeds from our million convertible subordinated note offering which was completed in august and financing under our then existing receivable securitization program 
at september   the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million  and the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million 
the fair values were determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of our other assets and liabilities approximates the book value of those assets and liabilities 
on july   standard poor s lowered its rating on the above referenced convertible subordinated notes to ccc from b stating  continued declines in the company s cash position  along with expectations that recovery in the semiconductor packaging equipment industry is likely to be slower than previously expected as their reason for the downgrade 
in february  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  senior debt securities  senior subordinated debt securities  subordinated debt securities  warrants and units  having an aggregate sales price of up to million 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on august  we believe that our existing cash reserves and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may seek  as we believe appropriate  additional debt or equity financing to provide capital for corporate purposes and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions  competitive factors and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which we may elect to pursue 

table of contents we have certain obligations and contingent payments under various arrangements at september  as follows total amounts due in less than year amounts due in years amounts due in years amounts due in more than years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments represents contractual amounts not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at september  long term debt includes the amounts due under our convertible subordinated notes due and our convertible subordinated notes due the capital lease obligations principally relate to equipment leases 
the operating lease obligations at september  represent obligations due under various facility and capital equipment leases with terms up to fifteen years in duration 
inventory purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase commitments for inventory components ordered in the normal course of business 
the standby letters of credit represent obligations of the company for security under various facility leases and employee benefit programs 
risk factors the semiconductor industry as a whole is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns our operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors  such as personal computers  telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
this has severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment  including the assembly equipment that we manufacture and market and  to a lesser extent  the packaging materials and test interconnect solutions that we sell 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly  which we expect will continue to be the case 
although these fluctuations are partly due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry  they also reflect the impact of other factors 
many of the factors that affect our operating results are outside of our control 

table of contents some of the factors that could cause our revenues and or operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are market downturns  the mix of products that we sell because  for example some packaging materials have lower margins than assembly equipment and test interconnect solutions  some lines of equipment are more profitable than others  and some sales arrangements have higher margins than others  the volume and timing of orders for our products and any order postponements and cancellations by our customers  the cancellation  deferral or rescheduling of orders  because virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer without prior notice and with limited or no penalties  adverse changes in our pricing  or that of our competitors  higher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models  the availability and cost of key components for our products  market acceptance of our new products and upgraded versions of our products  our announcement  or perception by others  that we will introduce new or upgraded products  which could cause customers to delay purchasing our products  the timing of acquisitions  and our competitors introduction of new products 
many of our expenses  such as research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  do not vary directly with our net sales 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net sales  our operating results would decline 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  severance  resizing and other costs of relocating facilities  inventory write offs due to obsolescence  and inflationary increases in the cost of labor or materials 
because our revenues and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our business depends on attracting and retaining management  marketing and technical employees who are in great demand as is the case with many other technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
competition is intense in personnel recruiting in the semiconductor and 
table of contents semiconductor equipment industries  specifically with respect to some engineering disciplines 
in particular  we have experienced periodic shortages of software engineers 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel we require  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to rapidly develop and manufacture new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business we believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture or acquire new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we also must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment  leading edge materials and for test interconnect solutions customized to address rapid technological advances in ic and capital equipment designs 
our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior performance  features and lower prices that may render our products non competitive 
the development and commercialization of new products may require significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time  and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable 
in addition  we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner or at a price that will satisfy our customers future needs or achieve market acceptance 
we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our product lines we typically operate our business with a relatively short backlog and order supplies and otherwise plan production based on internal forecasts of demand 
due to these factors  we have in the past  and may again in the future  fail to accurately forecast demand  in terms of both volume and configuration for either our current or next generation wire bonders 
this has led to and may in the future lead to delays in product shipments or  alternatively  an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  including assembly equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and flip chip technologies  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
advanced packaging technologies other than wire bonding may render some of our products obsolete and our strategy for pursuing these other technologies may be costly and ineffective advanced packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package  as compared to traditional die and wire bonding 
these technologies include flip chip and wafer scale packaging 
in general  these advanced technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package 
for some devices  these advanced technologies have largely replaced wire bonding 
we cannot assure you that the semiconductor industry will not  in the future  shift a significant part of its volume into advanced packaging technologies  such as those discussed above 
if a significant shift to advanced technologies were to occur  demand for our wire bonders and related packaging materials could be materially and adversely affected 
a decline in demand for any of our products could cause our revenues to decline significantly if demand for  or pricing of  our wire bonders  flip chip technology or test interconnect solutions declines because our competitors introduce superior or lower cost systems  the semiconductor industry changes or because of other events beyond our control  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
because a small number of customers account for most of our sales  our revenues could decline if we lose any significant customer the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and flip chip bumping services and technology 
sales to a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
in fiscal sales to advanced semiconductor engineering accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  no 
table of contents customer accounted for more than of our net sales and in fiscal  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering and amkor technologies accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
if we lose orders from a significant customer  or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially  these losses or reductions will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for raw materials  components and subassemblies and  if our suppliers do not deliver their products to us  we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers our products are complex and require raw materials  components and subassemblies of an exceptionally high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some important components and raw materials  including gold 
as a result  we are exposed to a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process  changes in our manufacturing processes  dictated by changes in the market  that may delay our shipments  our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials  the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our contractors and suppliers  which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies  components or parts in the volumes we require and at quality levels and prices we can accept  reliability and quality problems we experience with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers  the exposure of our suppliers and subcontractors to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppage  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters  delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies  which  in turn  may cause delays in some of our shipments  and the loss of suppliers as a result of the consolidation of suppliers in the industry 
if we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time for these or any other reasons  if we are unable to meet customer expectations as to cycle time or if we do not maintain acceptable product quality or reliability in the future  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we are expanding and diversifying our operations  and if we fail to manage our expanding and more diverse operations successfully  our business and financial results may be materially and adversely affected during fiscal  we acquired two companies that design and manufacture test interconnect solutions  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  and we have combined their operations to create our test division 
although our strategy is to diversify and expand our products and services  we may not be able to develop  acquire  introduce or market new products in a timely or cost effective manner and the market may not accept any new or improved products we develop  acquire  introduce or market 
our diversification into new lines of business and our expansion through acquisitions and alliances is expected to increase demands on our management  financial resources and information and internal control systems 
our success depends in significant part on our ability to manage and integrate acquisitions  joint ventures and other alliances and to continue to implement  improve and expand our systems  procedures and controls 
if we fail to do this at a pace consistent with the development of our business  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents as we expand our operations  we expect to encounter a number of risks  which will include risks associated with hiring additional management and other critical personnel  risks associated with adding equipment and capacity  and risks associated with increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
in addition  sales and servicing of packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and flip chip technologies often require different organizational and managerial skills than sales of traditional wire bonding technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary skills to successfully produce and market these different products 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect and flip chip technology industries the semiconductor equipment  packaging materials  test interconnect solutions and flip chip technology industries are intensely competitive 
in the semiconductor equipment  test interconnect solutions and flip chip technology markets  the significant competitive factors include performance  quality  customer support and price  and in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include price  delivery and quality 
in each of our markets  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  some of which have significantly greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
we expect our competitors to improve their current products performance  and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics 
new product and materials introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales 
if a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product or materials for a particular assembly operation  we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time because manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relations with suppliers  and assembly equipment in our industry often goes years without requiring replacement 
in addition  we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete in these or other areas in the future 
we sell most of our products to customers that are located outside of the united states  we have substantial manufacturing operations located outside of the united states  and we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines  all of which subject us to risks from changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war approximately of our sales for fiscal  of our net sales for fiscal and of our net sales for fiscal were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states 
the lower percentage of international sales in fiscal and was due primarily to the sales of the test interconnect products which are more concentrated in the united states 
we expect our sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a large portion of our future revenues 
our future performance will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets  particularly in asia 
asian economies have been highly volatile  resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies  and political and economic instability 
these conditions may continue or worsen  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we also rely on non united states suppliers for materials and components used in the equipment that we sell and we maintain substantial manufacturing operations in countries other than the united states  including operations in israel and singapore 
we manufacture substantially all of our automatic ball bonders in singapore  and we are building a facility in china to manufacture capillaries  test fixtures and other products 
in addition  we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines 
as a result  a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international commerce  such as risks of war and civil disturbances or other events that 
table of contents may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation of our foreign assets  longer payment cycles in foreign markets  international exchange restrictions  the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations  tariff and currency fluctuations  changing political conditions  foreign governments monetary policies  and less protective foreign intellectual property laws 
because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  an increase in value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors 
our ability to compete overseas in the future could be materially and adversely affected by a strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
the ability of our international operations to prosper also will depend  in part  on a continuation of current trade relations between the united states and foreign countries in which our customers operate and in which our subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations 
a change toward more protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries in which we do business  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
our success depends in part on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely principally on contractual restrictions such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements in our agreements with employees  vendors  consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we also rely  in some cases  on patent and copyright protection  which may become more important to us as we expand our investment in advanced packaging technologies 
we may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons  including our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to or better than ours  employees  vendors  consultants and customers may not abide by their contractual agreements  and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology  patents or copyrights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology 
in addition  our partners and alliances may also have rights to technology that we develop through these alliances 
we may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be weakened 
third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property  which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses  or prevent us from selling some of our products the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new products and technologies 
as a result  industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others  increasing the risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims that they infringe on the intellectual property of others 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement 
if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture  market or use the affected product  or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
occasionally  third parties assert that we are  or may be  infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in these cases  we will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate 
intellectual 
table of contents property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business 
some of our customers are parties to litigation brought by the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership the lemelson foundation  in which the lemelson foundation claims that certain manufacturing processes used by those customers infringe patents held by the lemelson foundation 
we have never been named a party to any such litigation 
some customers have requested that we indemnify them to the extent their liability for these claims arises from use of our equipment 
we do not believe that products sold by us infringe valid lemelson patents 
if a claim for contribution was brought against us  we believe we would have valid defenses to assert and also would have rights to contribution and claims against our suppliers 
we have never incurred any material liability with respect to the lemelson claims or any other pending intellectual property claim and we do not believe that these claims will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim that might be made  however  is uncertain and we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such claim will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations we are subject to various and frequently changing federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous material  investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
proper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants 
in many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater 
these facilities operate under effluent discharge permits that must be renewed periodically 
a violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits  fines  penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits 
in the future  applicable land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability  and or cause us to curtail our operations 
we cannot assure you that any costs or liabilities associated with complying with these environmental laws will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that classify our board of directors into four classes  with one class being elected each year  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval  and prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority board or shareholder approval 
further  under the pennsylvania business corporation law  because our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  shareholders may only remove directors for cause 
these provisions and some provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law could delay  defer or prevent us from experiencing a change in control and may adversely affect our common stockholders voting and other rights 

table of contents we may be unable to generate enough cash to service our debt our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures and other activities will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to the volatile nature of our business  and general economic  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
if our current convertible debt is not converted to our common shares  we will be required to make annual cash interest payments of million through fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal on our million of convertible subordinated notes 
principal payments of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt 
in addition  our gold supply agreement contains restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends to us 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
our primary facilities include administrative  sales and r d facilities in the united states of america and manufacturing facilities in the united states  israel and singapore 
also  these attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for all of our facilities 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products in the united states and overseas 
as a result of terrorism  the united states may enter into an armed conflict  which could have a further impact on our domestic and internal sales  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver product to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile  which may make the common stock difficult to resell at attractive times and prices in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in our revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or other companies  and slowdowns or downturns in the semiconductor industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   we had a non trading investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of million see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate and exchange rate risk and may fall in value if market rates change 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately thousand 
we also had investments in equity securities of million at september  of which of the portfolio is vulnerable to market risk
