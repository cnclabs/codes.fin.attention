the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by ivillage 
revenue recognition to date  ivillage s revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of sponsorship and advertising contracts 
sponsorship revenues are derived principally from contracts ranging from one to three years 
sponsorships are designed to support the customer s broad marketing objectives  including brand promotion  awareness  product introductions and online research 
sponsorship agreements typically include the delivery of impressions on ivillage s web sites and occasionally the design and development of customized sites that enhance the promotional objectives of the sponsor 
an impression is the viewing of promotional material on a web page  which may include banner advertisements  links  buttons or other text or images 
as part of certain sponsorship agreements  sponsors who also sell products may provide ivillage with a commission on sales of their products generated through ivillage s web sites 
to date  these amounts have not been significant 
advertising revenues are derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which ivillage typically guarantees a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
sponsorship and advertising revenues are recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that ivillage has no continuing obligations and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or the straight line basis over the term of the contract 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  ivillage defers recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
included in sponsorship and advertising revenues are revenues from advertising placements in lamaze publishing s publications  videos and web sites  and satellite broadcasts on the newborn channel 
in addition  revenues are generated through a sampling and coupon program  which offers advertisers the ability to distribute samples  coupons and promotional literature to new and expectant parents 
sponsorship and advertising revenues also include barter revenues  which generally represent exchanges by ivillage of advertising space on its web sites for reciprocal advertising space or traffic on other web sites 
revenues and expenses from these barter transactions are recorded based upon the fair value of the advertisements delivered 
fair value of advertisements delivered is based upon ivillage s recent practice of receiving cash from similar advertisers 
barter revenues are recognized when the advertisements are displayed on ivillage 
com and its affiliated properties 
barter expenses are recognized when ivillage s advertisements are displayed on the reciprocal web sites or properties  which is typically in the same period as when advertisements are displayed on ivillage 
com and its affiliated properties  and are included as part of sales and marketing expenses 
revenues from barter transactions were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
ivillage solutions is a business unit within ivillage that provides production and back end provisioning for customers in need of these services 
ivillage recognizes revenues from production services based upon actual hours worked at ivillage s negotiated hourly rates and or fixed fees stipulated in contracts 
business women s network is one of the most comprehensive sources of information and program linkage to the women s market around the world and offers one of the most extensive databases of women s organizations and web sites in the nation to subscribing companies and members 
revenues from business women s network are generated primarily through subscription based programs that convey current best practices for women and diversity issues in the workplace 
ivillage recognizes revenue from these subscriptions ratably over the term of the contract 
revenues from the e commerce portion of astrology 
com consist of the sale of astrological charts and other related products to visitors to the astrology 
com web site 
ivillage recognizes revenues from astrology 
com product sales  net of any discounts  when products are shipped to customers and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
ivillage received fees from licensing portions of its content in connection with its agreement with planetrx 
com  inc these fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  which ends in the first quarter of ivillage has and expects to continue to receive revenues from new initiatives involving subscription based properties and the sale of research 
while ivillage believes that one or both of these new initiatives will develop into a new source of significant revenues  ivillage can make no assurance that it will be successful in any of these endeavors since none of them have generated any significant revenues to date 
goodwill and intangible assets ivillage assesses the recoverability of its goodwill and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balance over its remaining life can be recovered through forecasted cash flows 
if undiscounted forecasted cash flows indicate that the unamortized amounts will not be recovered  an adjustment is made to reduce the net amounts to an amount consistent with forecasted future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated when estimating future discounted cash flows 
future cash flows are based on trends of historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions

ivillage leases office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through april the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  for the next five years year ending december  in thousands ivillage s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including o market acceptance of its services  o the amount of resources ivillage devotes to investments in the ivillage network  including entering into joint ventures with and or the acquisition of other entities  o the resources ivillage devotes to marketing  and o the resources ivillage devotes to selling its services and brand promotions 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting for business combinations by requiring that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas requires that the purchase method be used for business combinations initiated after june  sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
effective january   amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas will be reclassified to goodwill 
goodwill will be subject to an annual impairment test  including a transitional impairment test required upon adoption  which must be performed in the year ending december  ivillage is still in the process of reallocating previously identifiable intangible assets that do not meet the criteria of sfas into goodwill and evaluating the useful lives of its remaining identifiable intangible assets 
however  ivillage currently estimates that unaudited pro forma net loss attributable to common stockholders and the respective basic and diluted net loss per share would have been approximately million and  respectively  for the year ended december  had the provisions of the new standards been applied this year 
ivillage is in the process of completing the transitional impairment assessment of goodwill 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the objective of sfas is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the retirement obligations included within the scope of this project are those that an entity cannot avoid as a result of either the acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset 
components of larger systems also fall under this project  as well as tangible long lived assets with indeterminable lives 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  ivillage has not yet evaluated the expected impact of the adoption of sfas on its financial condition  cash flows and results of operations and will adopt sfas in fiscal in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  ivillage does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on ivillage s results of operations or financial position 
risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition risks relating to the offer and proposed merger with promotions 
com the market price of ivillage common stock may decline after completion of the offer and the merger 
the market price of ivillage common stock may decline after completion of the offer and the merger if o the integration of the business and operations of promotions 
com is unsuccessful or takes longer than anticipated  o the effect of the merger on ivillage s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of securities analysts or investors  o ivillage does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by securities analysts or investors  or o following the merger  significant stockholders of ivillage decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their expectations 
ivillage s stock price has been volatile and you should expect it to continue to fluctuate 
in attempting to integrate the business and technology of promotions 
com  ivillage will incur significant costs which may harm its business 
ivillage expects to incur costs and commit significant management time integrating promotions 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel 
these costs may be substantial and may include costs for o integration of operations  including combining teams and processes in various functional areas  o reorganization or closure of operations and or facilities  o integration of technology  web sites and products  o fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing the integration process  and o potential existing liabilities of promotions 
com 
successful integration of promotions 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel will place a significant burden on the management and internal resources of ivillage 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the ivillage s future business  financial condition and results of operations 
if ivillage does not successfully integrate the business and operations of promotions 
com  ivillage s financial results and its ability to achieve profitability will be adversely affected 
upon the consummation of the merger  ivillage will commence the integration of promotions 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel 
ivillage will strive to maintain the companies relationships with key customers 
integration efforts may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on strategic plans  personnel and other decisions 
ivillage does not know whether it will be successful in these integration efforts and it cannot assure you that it will be able to integrate the business and operations of promotions 
com in a timely and efficient manner 
if ivillage cannot successfully integrate promotions 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel and maintain its and promotions 
com s relationships with key customers  the business  financial condition and results of operations of ivillage may be seriously harmed 
failure to complete the merger could negatively affect the business of ivillage and the market price of ivillage common stock 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  ivillage will be subject to a number of risks that may affect its business and common stock price  including o ivillage could be required to pay promotions 
com a  termination fee  o the market price of shares of ivillage common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of those shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed  o costs related to the merger  such as legal and accounting fees  must be paid even if the merger is not completed  o the benefits that ivillage expects to realize from the merger would not be realized  and o the diversion of management attention from the day to day business of ivillage and the unavoidable disruption to its employees and its relationships with customers and joint venturers during the period before consummation of the merger  may make it difficult for ivillage to regain its market position if the merger does not occur 
ivillage may incur liability under lawsuits currently pending against promotions 
com 
promotions 
com is currently engaged in a number of civil litigation matters  including a lawsuit brought by e 
piphany  inc e 
piphany 
e 
piphany is a software company that was engaged by promotions 
com in february to provide an e mail management software solution 
the lawsuit brought by e 
piphany alleges  among other claims  breach of contract as a result of nonpayment by promotions 
com 
the lawsuit seeks approximately  in damages 
if the merger is completed  ivillage may incur liability arising from this and other lawsuits pending against promotions 
com 
ivillage intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits  and believes that promotions 
com has several meritorious defenses and  in some instances  counterclaims 
litigation is  however  never certain 
if the defenses are not successful  ivillage may be forced to make material payments to these plaintiffs and these payments  if not fully covered by insurance carriers or promotions 
com s existing litigation reserves  could harm ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if these claims are not successful  the litigation could result in material costs to ivillage and could divert management s time and attention away from business operations 
risks relating to current and future operations ivillage may face difficulties encountered in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which it operates 
ivillage faces many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly evolving markets  including the internet advertising market 
these risks and difficulties include ivillage s ability to o attract a larger audience to the ivillage network of web sites  o increase awareness of the ivillage brand  o strengthen user loyalty  o offer compelling content  o maintain current  and develop new  strategic relationships  o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries  o respond effectively to competitive pressures  o continue to develop and upgrade ivillage s technology  and o attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and has recent and anticipated continuing losses 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and ivillage expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
ivillage incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december   ivillage s accumulated deficit was million 
ivillage will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
ivillage cannot make any assurances that it will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if ivillage does achieve profitability  ivillage cannot make any assurances that it will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if revenues grow slower than ivillage anticipates  or if operating expenses exceed ivillage s expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  its business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
because ivillage s strategy includes acquisitions of  and joint ventures with  other businesses  acquisition and joint venture expenses and any cash used to make these acquisitions and joint ventures will reduce its available cash 
ivillage s quarterly revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance  are difficult to forecast and have been and are likely to continue to fluctuate 
ivillage does not believe that period to period comparisons of its operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance  thus making it difficult to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations 
in addition  ivillage s operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of several factors  many of which are outside ivillage s control  and any of which could materially harm ivillage s business 
these factors include o fluctuations in the demand for internet advertising or electronic commerce  o bankruptcies or other payment defaults of internet or other companies that are a source of advertising revenues  o volatility in the internet market and the high number of internet companies decreasing their marketing budgets  o changes in the level of traffic on its network  and o fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs 
ivillage s revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on its web sites 
future revenues are difficult to forecast 
ivillage may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular quarter  which may materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in one or more future quarters  ivillage s results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if ivillage s results of operations fall below expectations  the trading price of its common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the revenues of ivillage in any particular quarter are lower than anticipated  ivillage may be unable to reduce spending in that quarter 
if ivillage has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its expenses  then ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
ivillage may need to raise additional capital and its prospects for obtaining additional financing are uncertain 
ivillage currently anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents that will be available to ivillage on consummation of the merger cannot be accurately predicted  however  and depends on many factors  including the amount of revenues received and expenses incurred by each company during the period prior to the date on which the merger is completed 
accordingly  ivillage may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund its operations 
ivillage can make no assurances that additional financing will be available to ivillage on acceptable terms  or at all 
in particular  unless the market price of ivillage s common stock increases dramatically  it is unlikely that ivillage will be able to raise funds through a public offering of its common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  ivillage would have to scale back its business and its business and financial condition would be harmed  or it may be forced to cease its operations entirely 
the downturn in the economy has raised uncertainties concerning ivillage s business prospects 
the national economy has recently experienced a slowdown 
as a result  many of ivillage s customers have experienced difficulty in maintaining their current operations and implementing their business plans 
many of these customers have reduced their spending on ivillage s products and services  and or may not be able to discharge their current payables and other obligations to ivillage 
the non payment or late payment of amounts due to ivillage from a significant customer  or the non payment or late payment by multiple customers which  in the aggregate  are substantial would materially adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   hearst owned approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage common stock and had three representatives on the ivillage board of directors  therefore  hearst is able to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies 
as of december   hearst owned approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage s common stock  assuming that all of the shares of women 
com networks  inc held by former women 
com stockholders had been exchanged for shares of ivillage common stock  in which case there would have been  shares of ivillage common stock outstanding 
in addition  hearst holds a warrant entitling it to purchase  shares of ivillage s common stock 
pursuant to an amended and restated stockholder agreement entered into between hearst and ivillage on june   ivillage appointed three representatives of hearst to its board of directors  with one hearst designee appointed to each class of director 
the amended and restated stockholder agreement provides that the number of hearst representatives is subject to reduction if hearst s ownership of ivillage common stock falls below certain threshold levels 
there is also a hearst representative on each of ivillage s nominating and compensation committees 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership allows hearst to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies  including any mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  strategic relationships or sales of assets 
this board representation and stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which ivillage stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  the interests of hearst  which owns or has significant investments in other businesses  including cable television networks  newspapers  magazines and electronic media  may from time to time be competitive with  or otherwise diverge from  ivillage s interests  particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future acquisitions 
although hearst is required to vote all shares that it holds in excess of subject to adjustment of ivillage s outstanding voting securities in accordance with the recommendation of ivillage s board of directors  hearst may effectively control certain stockholder actions  including approving changes to ivillage s certificate of incorporation or bylaws and adopting or changing equity incentive plans 
hearst s effective control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger  consolidation  sale of all or substantially all of ivillage s assets or other form of change of control that ivillage might consider 
ivillage s business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow 
ivillage s market is new and rapidly evolving 
ivillage s business would be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly usage by women 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security concerns  o inconsistent quality of service  o lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for information  shopping and services  and o privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather information about users without their knowledge or consent 
if internet usage continues to grow significantly  internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  internet service providers and web sites have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of the bankruptcies of internet service and infrastructure providers  outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these service interruptions frequently occur in the future  internet usage  including the usage of ivillage s web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
the market for internet advertising is still developing 
if the internet fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising  ivillage would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater than expected losses 
ivillage expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future  as demand and market acceptance for internet advertising continues to develop 
accordingly  ivillage s business depends on market acceptance of the internet as a medium for advertising 
although ivillage derives a portion of its revenues from fees for internet content and services  consumer reluctance to subscribe to or pay for internet content and services may limit ivillage s ability to supplement internet advertising as a substantial source of revenue in the foreseeable future 
although there are currently several standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  the industry has had difficulty convincing potential advertisers that internet advertising is a significant advertising medium 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising 
in addition  advertisers and advertising agencies that use the internet as an advertising medium may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services than traditional advertising media  including television  radio and print 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
the market for online advertising also depends on the overall growth and acceptance of electronic commerce 
if the markets for online advertising and electronic commerce fail to develop or develop more slowly than ivillage expects  or if it is unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising  ivillage would have slower than expected revenue growth and would incur greater than expected losses  and its business and financial condition would be harmed 
furthermore  different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet and it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
this makes it difficult to project ivillage s future advertising rates and revenues 
ivillage has a small number of customers and the loss of a number of these customers could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues 
for the years ended december  and  revenues from ivillage s five largest customers accounted for approximately and of its total revenues  respectively 
unilever accounted for approximately of ivillage s total revenues for the year ended december  and no one customer accounted for greater than of ivillage s total revenues for the year ended december  at december   hearst  a related party  and unilever accounted for approximately and of ivillage s net accounts receivable  respectively  and  at december   ford motor media accounted for approximately of ivillage s net accounts receivable 
ivillage anticipates that its results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on revenues from a small number of customers 
in addition  ivillage s largest customers have in the past varied over time  and ivillage anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
consequently  the loss of even a small number of ivillage s largest customers at any one time may adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations  unless ivillage is able to enter into a sufficient number of new comparable contracts 
ivillage may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry 
ivillage s market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in ivillage s industry exacerbates these market characteristics 
to achieve its goals  ivillage needs to effectively integrate the various software programs and tools required to enhance and improve its product offerings and manage its business 
for example  ivillage s failure to promptly or adequately implement the world wide web consortium s platform for privacy preferences  or pp  standards could result in reduced user traffic to ivillage s web sites or regulatory and or legal claims if ivillage s pp policy does not conform to ivillage s written privacy policy posted on its web sites 
ivillage s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of its services 
ivillage may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
in addition  ivillage s new enhancements must meet the requirements of ivillage s current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance 
ivillage also could incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes 
seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
if ivillage s market makes the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop also in its market  which  if similar to those in traditional media  may result in lower advertising revenues in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
in addition  traffic levels on ivillage s web sites typically fluctuate during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods 
these seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage s uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect its business 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is often lengthy  typically six weeks for smaller agreements and longer for larger agreements  and is subject to delays over which ivillage has little or no control  including o advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints  o advertisers and sponsors internal acceptance reviews  o the success and continued internal support of advertisers and sponsors own development efforts  and o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or sponsors 
during the sales cycle  ivillage may expend funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues 
accordingly  ivillage s results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
ivillage relies on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of its user base and delivery of advertisements on ivillage s web sites 
ivillage s business would be harmed if these third parties fail to provide these services to ivillage 
it is important to ivillage s advertisers that ivillage accurately measure the demographics of its user base and the delivery of advertisements on ivillage s web sites 
ivillage depends on third parties to provide many of these measurement services 
if these third parties are unable or unwilling to provide these services to ivillage in the future  ivillage would need to perform them or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause ivillage to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in its business until these services are replaced 
companies may choose to not advertise on ivillage s web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive ivillage s demographic measurements are not reliable 
either of these events could adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage has historically relied on third parties to drive traffic to ivillage s web sites and generate page views  and ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by the recent expiration or termination of certain agreements 
historically  aol has accounted for a significant portion of ivillage s online traffic based on the delivery to ivillage of a guaranteed number of impressions 
ivillage s primary agreement with aol expired on december   women 
com terminated its agreement with aol in december and ivillage s agreement with aol related to astrology content expires in june although ivillage is currently negotiating an extension of its primary agreement with aol or  alternatively  a new aol agreement  there is no assurance that ivillage will be able to enter into an acceptable agreement with aol or that aol will not discontinue carrying ivillage s content 
aol is not prohibited from carrying online sites or developing and providing content that competes with ivillage s web sites  and aol currently carries competing web sites 
as a result of the expiration or termination of ivillage s agreements with aol  or if aol decides to discontinue carrying ivillage content  traffic to ivillage s web sites may decline and ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
ivillage may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail to provide reliable software  systems and related services to ivillage 
ivillage depends on various third parties for software  systems and related services 
for example  ivillage relies on doubleclick inc s software for the placement of advertisements  trellix corporation for personal space home pages and mailworld  inc for e mail 
several of the third parties which provide software and services to ivillage have a limited operating history  have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable delivery of services from others 
as a result  ivillage s ability to deliver various services to its users may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services to ivillage 
if ivillage is unable to deliver the services that its users expect  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
ivillage s principal investors investments in its competitors may result in conflicts of interest that could be adverse to ivillage 
ivillage s principal investors  such as aol time warner  rho capital partners  inc and hearst  may have conflicts of interests by virtue of investments in other companies that may compete with ivillage 
these investments may result in a conflict of interest for ivillage s principal investors or result in the diversion of attractive business opportunities from ivillage s principal investors to another company 
ivillage is unable to determine all of the competing investments held by these principal investors 
in addition  ivillage does not have the ability to constrain the investment activity of any of its principal investors and therefore cannot predict the extent of any future investments in businesses that are competitive with ivillage 
restrictions on ivillage s ability to enter into sponsorship  advertising or other business relationships with hearst s competitors may adversely affect ivillage s business 
in connection with ivillage s merger with women 
com in june  ivillage entered into a magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst 
that agreement restricts ivillage s ability to enter into relationships with competitors of hearst and those restrictions may prevent ivillage from expanding its network and enhancing its content and the visibility of ivillage s brand  and may cause ivillage to forego potential advertising revenues from competitors of hearst 
specifically  the agreement provides that ivillage may not  without hearst s consent o enter into any agreement to include in ivillage s network any web sites for magazines that compete with hearst magazines  o display on the magazine web sites any advertising or other promotional materials from magazines that compete with hearst magazines  or o display on an ivillage web page the brands  logos  trademarks or proprietary content of both hearst and a hearst competitor 
ivillage s business could be affected by future terrorist attacks 
although neither the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in september nor the late bio terrorist attacks on various organizations have had a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  operations or financial condition  ivillage cannot assure you that future terrorist attacks in the united states  and particularly in new york city where ivillage s headquarters are located  or the response of the us government to the recent or any future terrorist actions  would not negatively affect ivillage through further disruption of the economy or financial markets  or otherwise 
the proximity of ivillage s headquarters to certain possible terrorist targets in new york city could also  in the event of future terrorist attacks  result in damage to or destruction of ivillage s headquarters as well as the permanent or temporary loss of key personnel 
ivillage has not yet fully developed a disaster recovery plan and ivillage cannot guarantee that ivillage s insurance coverage would adequately reimburse ivillage for any damages suffered as a result of a terrorist attack 
ivillage may not be able to expand its business through acquisitions and joint ventures if ivillage is unable to compete successfully for acquisition candidates and or joint venture partners and  even if ivillage is successful in this regard  ivillage s operations may be adversely affected as a result of an acquisition or joint venture 
ivillage s business strategy includes growth through business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures 
ivillage s business could be harmed if it is unable to implement this business strategy 
ivillage s ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on ivillage s ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting ivillage s ability to compete successfully in this regard include o ivillage s financial condition relative to the financial condition of its competitors  and o the attractiveness of ivillage s common stock as potential consideration for entering into these types of transactions as compared to the common stock of other entities competing for these opportunities 
many of the entities with which ivillage competes for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners have greater financial resources than those of ivillage 
in addition  ivillage s acquisition program has been materially adversely affected by the substantial decline in the market price of ivillage s common stock 
if  despite these factors  ivillage is successful in entering into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures  ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if ivillage is unable to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures 
ivillage s ability to integrate the operation of the acquired companies or joint ventures will depend  in part  on ivillage s ability to overcome or address o the difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and the potential disruption of ivillage s ongoing business as a result of these assimilation efforts  o the difficulties of establishing a new joint venture  including the need to attract and retain qualified personnel and the need to attract customers and advertisers  o the need to incorporate successfully the acquired or shared technology or content and rights into ivillage s products and media properties  o the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and o the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of personnel 
in addition  effecting acquisitions could require use of a significant amount of ivillage s available cash 
furthermore  ivillage may have to issue equity or equity linked securities to pay for future acquisitions  and any of these issuances could be dilutive to existing and future stockholders 
in addition  acquisitions and investments may have negative effects on ivillage s reported results of operations due to acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  and or potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses or joint ventures 
any of these acquisition related risks or costs could harm ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is intense competition among internet based businesses and publishing companies focused on women  and this competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
there are a large number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers 
ivillage s web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies o online services or web sites targeted at women  such as oxygen 
com and condenet 
com  o cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  inc and lifetime television  o web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as aol  terra networks  sa and yahoo inc  o e commerce companies such as amazon 
com  inc  and o publishers and distributors of traditional media  such as television  radio and print 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and aol time warner 
these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage s business would be harmed if ivillage s systems fail or experience a slowdown 
substantially all of ivillage s communications hardware and some of its other computer hardware operations are located at exodus communications facilities in new jersey and verio s facilities in california 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
system failures may adversely affect ivillage s user traffic  which could adversely affect its revenues and operating results and harm its reputation with users  advertisers and commerce partners 
computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those historically experienced by several leading web sites  could also adversely affect ivillage s web sites 
ivillage s insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in its systems 
ivillage does not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
in addition  exodus communications recently filed for bankruptcy protection and ivillage cannot assure you that exodus communications will be able to continue to provide sufficient services for ivillage or that ivillage will be able to engage a satisfactory alternative service provider 
ivillage s web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
ivillage s web sites have in the past experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences have not had a material effect on ivillage s business 
these types of occurrences in the future could cause users to perceive ivillage s web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause them to use another web site or other methods to obtain information 
in addition  ivillage s users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to ivillage s web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to ivillage s systems 
ivillage may incur liability for the information ivillage publishes or the products and services ivillage has sold 
ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if ivillage were to become liable for damage claims based on information published by it or products and services sold by it 
for example  ivillage has been in the past  and may be in the future  subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information ivillage publishes on its web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against providers of internet services in the past 
in addition  ivillage could be subjected to claims based upon the content that is accessible from ivillage s web sites through links to other web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards 
in addition  through ivillage 
com  women 
com  lamaze publishing and ivillage integrated properties  inc  ivillage distributes publications and broadcasts over its web sites and the newborn channel information and advice regarding healthcare  childbirth  infant care and financial and tax issues 
ivillage may be exposed to liability claims in connection with this information 
ivillage also offers e mail services through a third party vendor  which may subject ivillage to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of e mail or interruptions or delays in e mail service 
consumers may also sue ivillage if any of the products or services that it sells are found to be defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
ivillage may also face potential liability in connection with the sale of products and services by its e commerce and other partners 
ivillage s insurance  which covers commercial general liability  may not adequately protect ivillage against these claims 
liability claims could require ivillage to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages 
as a result  liability claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage ivillage s reputation and ivillage s business 
ivillage may also be forced to implement expensive measures to alter the way ivillage s services are provided to avoid potential liability 
possible infringement by third parties of ivillage s intellectual property rights  or claims of intellectual property infringement asserted against ivillage  could harm ivillage s business 
ivillage cannot be certain that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate ivillage s proprietary rights 
enforcing ivillage s intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
any infringement or misappropriation by third parties could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s future financial results 
furthermore  ivillage has invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
ivillage cannot guarantee that ivillage will be entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
although ivillage believes that its technologies do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  third parties have in the past asserted  and could assert in the future  claims of patent  trademark or copyright infringement or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats against ivillage with respect to ivillage s use of domain names  ivillage s content  web page formats  web business methods or any third party content it carries 
ivillage expects that participants in ivillage s markets will continue to be subject to infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  require ivillage to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent ivillage from using important technologies  ideas or formats  any of which could materially harm ivillage s business  financial condition or results of operations 
ivillage may face potential liability for its privacy practices 
growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject ivillage to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
if ivillage is accused of violating the stated terms of ivillage s privacy policy  ivillage may be forced to expend significant amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against these accusations 
ivillage also may be required to make changes to its present and planned products or services 
these consequences  together with any resulting liability for ivillage s privacy practices  could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage may be liable if third parties misappropriate ivillage s users personal information 
if third parties were able to penetrate ivillage s network security or otherwise misappropriate its users personal information or credit card information  ivillage could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
ivillage could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if ivillage s privacy practices are investigated 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair ivillage s ability to obtain information about its users  which could result in decreased advertising revenues 
if ivillage becomes unable to collect personal data from a sufficient number of the users of its network  ivillage may lose significant advertising revenues 
ivillage asks its members and users to opt in to receive special offers and other direct marketing opportunities from ivillage  its advertisers and partners 
ivillage s network also requests and obtains personal data from users who register to become members of the network 
registration as a member is required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by ivillage s network 
personal data gathered from members is used to tailor content to them and is provided  on an aggregate basis  to advertisers to assist them in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
the attractiveness of ivillage s network to current or prospective advertisers depends in part on ivillage s ability to provide user data to support this tailoring capability 
privacy concerns may cause users to resist providing this personal data  however 
even the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of ivillage s use of personal data 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user 
other countries and political entities  such as the european economic community  have adopted legislation or regulations containing these notification requirements 
ivillage s network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
information gathered from cookies are used by ivillage to tailor content to users of ivillage s network and may also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis 
in addition  advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
germany has imposed laws limiting the use of cookies  and a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
if these laws are passed  it may become more difficult for ivillage to tailor content to its users  making ivillage s network less attractive to users 
similarly  the unavailability of cookies may restrict the use of tailored advertising  making ivillage s network less attractive to advertisers and causing ivillage to lose significant advertising revenues 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to doing business on the internet 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the internet 
laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy  pricing and taxation  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust matters and the characteristics and quality of products and services  however 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as property ownership  obscenity  libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet or the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to ivillage s business 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect ivillage s business 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although ivillage s transmissions over the internet originate primarily in new york  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate ivillage s business activities 
in addition  because ivillage s service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  these jurisdictions may require ivillage to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries  which could subject ivillage to taxes and other regulations

if ivillage fails to attract and retain key personnel  ivillage s business would be materially adversely affected 
ivillage s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of ivillage s senior management and other key personnel  particularly douglas w 
mccormick  ivillage s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mccormick would likely harm ivillage s business 
ivillage currently does not maintain key person life insurance for any of ivillage s senior management

as a result  ivillage has in the past and may in the future incur increased salaries and benefits 
if ivillage does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating its current personnel  ivillage s business will be materially adversely affected
