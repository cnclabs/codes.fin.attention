we have two principal operating groups electrical electronics and maintenance products 
through one of our subsidiaries  we also operate a waste to energy facility  and we also have a minority equity investment in a seafood harvesting and farming company 
we have disposed of our entire previously reported machinery manufacturing group and  accordingly  that group has been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements

b 
depreciation and amortization includes amounts recorded for impairments of long lived assets 
compared to electrical electronics group the electrical electronics group s sales decreased million or due to decreased volumes at woods  woods canada and gc waldom 
sales at hamilton were also lower  but to a lesser extent than the other three businesses 
we sold thorsen tools during the second quarter of  which accounted for million of the sales decrease 
excluding the impact of thorsen tools  sales in the group were lower by 
the sales decreases are primarily attributable to slower economic conditions during  especially as those conditions caused retailers to reduce inventory levels during the early portion of sales at gc waldom were hurt specifically by softness in the telecommunications and high tech sectors the group s operating income decreased million or 
operating results were negatively impacted by unusual items of million including million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  the largest occurring at woods relating to exiting licensed branded product lines million and at gc waldom million 
other significant unusual items impacting operating results include severance and restructuring charges of million and related impairments of long lived assets of million  and other items of million 
unusual items impacted operating results in as well  including a million product recall and million severance charge at woods  and a million inventory valuation adjustment at gc waldom 
operating results excluding the items detailed above improved in  with operating income increasing million  or  and operating margin increasing from to 
significant reductions in selling  general and administration costs at woods and woods canada in as compared to sg a costs as a percentage of sales for the two entities combined dropped from to  excluding the unusual items discussed above 
identifiable assets for the group decreased million or during the year mainly as a result of lower working capital levels at woods  woods canada and gc waldom 
these reductions were the result of aggressive efforts to reduce inventories  as well as lower levels of capital expenditures 
also  assets of thorsen tools  which were sold during  accounted for approximately million of the reduction 
maintenance products group sales from the maintenance products group decreased million or 
sales decreased in at contico and wilen  and to a lesser extent at duckback  gemtex and disco 
sales increased at glit microtron and loren 
the group experienced weakness in both the retail and institutional sectors to which it sells 
retailers efforts to reduce inventories  especially in early  led to softer sales for contico and duckback  and a slower economy contributed to softer sales in the janitorial sanitation markets 
the group s operating income decreased million 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at wilen because consistently poor operating performance led us to conclude that the carrying values of certain long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows 
in addition to the impairment at wilen  an additional million of impairment charges were taken  related primarily to management decisions regarding the discontinuance of certain property  plant and equipment 
additional items that negatively impacted operating results during include severance and restructuring charges of million  primarily at contico and wilen  and valuation reserve adjustments for inventory and receivables of million 
operating results in were negatively impacted by unusual items of million  including million in severance and restructuring charges  a million increase to its lifo inventory reserve at contico and an inventory write down at wilen of million 
excluding the impact of unusual items  operating income for the group declined million  or  and operating margin declined from to 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales from to  with improvements at contico  glit microtron  loren and disco offset by higher percentages of sg a at wilen  duckback and gemtex 
the overall improvement in sg a excluding the unusual items was offset by reduced gross margins at all businesses  led by contico 
decreased volumes and the inability to reduce overhead accordingly was the main cause of the margin decreases 
the group saw its overall gross margin decrease from to  excluding unusual items 
offsetting these factors were prices paid for various resins  a key raw material for plastic products produced by contico  which were lower in than in  especially for polypropylene 
the lower prices for resins taken alone accounted for approximately million in lower cost goods sold during versus identifiable assets for the group decreased million  or  in part due to a million write off of long lived assets in the mop  broom and brush business 
an inventory reduction effort on a company wide basis resulted in lower working capital levels at each division in lower levels of capital expenditures also contributed to the decline 
other sales from other operations increased modestly as a result of higher sales at the waste to energy facility 
operating income from other operations decreased million  primarily as a result of a million impairment of our investment in the waste to energy facility and related property  plant and equipment 
excluding the effect of the write off  operating income increased million as a result of improved profitability at the waste to energy facility 
identifiable assets for our other operations decreased million in connection with the write off of katy s investment in the waste to energy facility 
discontinued operations all of the companies included in discontinued operations were disposed of as of december  corporate corporate expenses increased million  or  however  corporate incurred million of unusual charges  consisting primarily of restructuring and severance charges and other costs incurred in connection with the recapitalization 
we recorded million of severance and restructuring charges  the majority of which relate to payments made in connection with management transition 
included in this amount is approximately million of charges that relate to outside consultants working with katy to modify operating and financial strategies  and million of non cancelable rent and other exit costs associated with the premature termination of our leased office facility in englewood  colorado 
we also incurred approximately million of costs associated with the recapitalization  such as non capitalizable legal fees and investment banker fees  board and committee fees and other internal incremental costs 
other unusual items included increases to claims and environmental reserves of million and other items totaling million 
operating results in were negatively impacted by million in unusual items  including million of severance and restructuring charges and million of costs associated with the recapitalization  partially offset by proceeds of million related to a previously written off investment 
excluding these unusual items  corporate costs decreased slightly from million to million  or 
identifiable assets at corporate increased primarily as a result of higher cash levels at year end relative to  and a net long term deferred tax asset position at december  versus year end  when a net long term deferred tax liability position existed 
interest expense decreased million  or  due primarily to reduced borrowings outstanding  especially during the second half of as a result of the recapitalization 
we also paid lower rates of interest during as a result of lower rates of interest available for our variable rate debt facilities 
the income tax benefit from continuing operations excluding the tax effect of distributions on preferred securities for is million  yielding an effective tax rate of  compared to a rate of in the reduced effective tax rate is the result of valuation allowances applied to certain net operating loss carryforwards created during and compared to electrical electronics the electrical electronics group s sales decreased million or primarily due to decreased volumes at woods  gc waldom  and thorsen tools  partially offset by increased volumes at hamilton  and to a lesser extent  woods canada 
sales decreases at woods occurred partially as a result of sales including final sales to a single large customer that withdrew its commitment to purchase woods products  as announced on november  sales were also lower late in compared to as a result of retail customers reducing orders and inventory levels 
sales at gc waldom softened in to a certain extent due to operational problems experienced primarily in as a result of the consolidation of gc electronics and waldom electronics  which in turn affected those divisions customer service 
the group s operating income decreased million or 
operating results were negatively impacted by unusual items of million including million in restructuring and severance charges at woods  a million product recall at woods and a million inventory valuation at gc waldom 
the group s operating income was negatively impacted by million restructuring charge  primarily for severance costs at woods 
excluding these items operating income increased million or 
operating results  excluding unusual items  were positively affected by significant reductions in selling  general and administration costs at woods in as compared to identifiable assets for the group decreased million or during the year mainly as a result of lower working capital levels at woods  woods canada and gc waldom  and lower levels of capital expenditures 
maintenance products sales from the maintenance products group increased million or 
sales remained relatively flat in as increased sales at contico and to a lesser extent at disco were partially offset by decreased sales at glit microtron and wilen  and to a lesser extent by lower sales at gemtex  duckback and loren 
the group s operating income decreased million or 
operating results in were negatively impacted by unusual items of million including million in severance and restructuring charges  a million increase to its lifo inventory reserve at contico and an inventory write down at wilen of million 
the group s operating income was negatively impacted by a million increase to its lifo inventory reserve at contico  and a million charge related to the restructuring of contico s marketing representative group 
excluding these items  operating income decreased by million  or 
higher costs for plastic resins resulted in reduced margins at contico 
we estimate that resin costs negatively impacted results versus prior year by million  due to an inability to recover or offset higher costs for raw materials 
also contributing to the decreased operating income levels were poor performance at wilen  which experienced systems and other operational problems throughout operating income was also lower  albeit to lesser extents  at glit microtron and duckback 
most of our consolidated foreign currency translation adjustment resulted from the translation of maintenance products operations in canada and the united kingdom 
identifiable assets for the group decreased million or primarily as a result of lower working capital levels at contico  glit gemtex and wilen and lower levels of capital expenditures 
other sales from other operations remained relatively stable compared to prior year  decreasing million or 
operating income attributable to other operations decreased million or primarily as a result of increased maintenance costs coupled with fixed revenue contracts 
identifiable assets for other operations remained relatively stable between years 
discontinued operations all of the companies included in discontinued operations have been disposed of as of december  corporate corporate expenses decreased million or 
operating results were negatively impacted by million in unusual items including million in severance and restructuring charges  million of costs associated with the recapitalization  offset by proceeds of million related to a previously written off investment 
corporate expenses in were impacted by an unusual charge of million associated with the attempted sale of the electrical electronics group 
excluding these items  corporate expenses decreased million or 
this decrease is attributable to reduced headcount and other salary related expenditures 
identifiable assets at corporate decreased primarily as a result of lower cash levels at year end 
interest expense increased million or  due primarily to higher interest rates paid by katy under the former credit agreement during as opposed to interest income decreased million as the company maintained lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to other  net in was income of million versus income of million in the amounts in both years resulted from us receiving past due balances on previously written off notes and investments 
the income tax benefit in is million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the provision for income taxes in was or an effective tax rate of 
the reduced effective tax rate resulted from the resolution of specific income tax matters with the relevant tax authorities 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources were improved at the end of the second quarter of as a result of the completion of the recapitalization 
following the recapitalization  we had borrowings outstanding under the new credit agreement at june  of million  which was reduced to million at december  million of the borrowings under the new credit agreement are due within one year  compared to borrowings under the former credit agreement at december  of million  all of which was due within one year 
we have also determined that an additional million of borrowings will be prepaid on or around april  see below 
following is a summary of the sources and uses of funds involved in consummating the recapitalization thousands of dollars sources sale of convertible preferred stock  borrowings under the new credit agreement  uses paydown of principal obligations under the former credit agreement  payment of accrued interest under the former credit agreement purchase of one half of preferred interest of contico at a discount  payment of accrued distributions on one half of preferred interest of subsidiary certain costs associated with the recapitalization  we believe that our liquidity and financial strength has been increased as a result of the cash infusion by the purchaser of the convertible preferred stock and borrowing availability under the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement  which provides for a total borrowing facility of million  has a million term loan portion term loan with a final maturity date of june  and quarterly repayments of million  the first of which was made on september  the term loan is based on orderly liquidation values of the company s property  plant and equipment 
the remaining portion of the new credit agreement is a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility that also has an expiration date of june  the borrowing base of the revolving credit facility is determined by eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
unused borrowing availability on the revolving credit facility was million at december  borrowing availability would have been higher at year end if not for several factors  including the duplication of a significant letter of credit letters of credit are added to funded debt in determining availability and an unusually high cash balance  due in part to over committed borrowings 
all extensions of credit under the new credit agreement are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in and lien upon the capital stock of each material domestic subsidiary of the capital stock of each material foreign subsidiary  and all present and future assets and properties of katy 
customary financial covenants and restrictions on the payment of dividends apply under the new credit agreement 
among other financial covenants  the company was required to generate earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other adjustments ebitda  as defined the in the new credit agreement in excess of million for the twelve months ended december  the company s actual ebitda for in this regard was million 
the minimum ebitda covenant adjusts to million for the twelve months periods ending september and december  interest accrues on borrowings at approximately basis points over the eurodollar rate for eurodollar rate loans and basis points over the prime rate for base rate loans until the close of the second quarter of following that  interest will be based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the new credit agreement 
total debt was of total capitalization at december  in connection with the revolving credit facility  the new credit agreement requires lockbox agreements which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding 
these agreements  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the new credit agreement  cause the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the fasb s emerging issues task force  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  the company does not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox agreements and the mae clause 
however  the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of june  also  we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants at december   the lender has not notified us of any indication of a mae at december   and to our knowledge  we were not in default of any provision of the new credit agreement at december  the new credit agreement calls for scheduled repayments of term loans of million during however  the new credit agreement also has a provision requiring the company to repay term loans by a percentage of excess cash flow consolidated excess cash flow as calculated under the new credit agreement generated during each annual reporting period 
as a result of this provision  and the calculation per the new credit agreement of consolidated excess cash flow generated during fiscal  we expect to repay term loans in the approximate amount of million on or around april  much of the consolidated excess cash flow was generated by improved working capital during this repayment would require us to convert term loans to revolving loans 
the most recently available calculations of our borrowing base eligible accounts receivable and inventory performed as of the end of the february reporting period indicated that we had unused borrowing availability of million 
the prepayment would reduce this unused availability 
as the result of an agreement related to the recapitalization  we reduced the amount outstanding of the preferred interest in contico by acquiring approximately one half of such interest at a significant discount 
this will result in a reduction of preferred cash distributions by approximately million annually 
key components of working capital excluding cash  current portion of deferred taxes  current maturities of debt  and the revolving credit facility decreased from december  by million 
the decrease was due in large part to a million reduction in inventories 
reductions in accounts receivable and accounts payable roughly offset each other 
included in the inventory decrease was million of valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
lower sales levels also contributed to the decrease 
however  a significant portion of the decrease was due to management efforts to operate the business with reduced stock levels and to monetize aged inventory 
we expect to commit million for capital projects in the continuing businesses over the course of funding for these expenditures and for working capital needs is expected to be accomplished through the use of available cash under the new credit agreement 
while a maximum of million is available under the new credit agreement  our borrowing base is limited under the revolving credit facility to eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
we feel that the new credit agreement provides sufficient liquidity for the company s operations going forward 
our borrowing availability at december   based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  exceeded our outstanding borrowings at year end by approximately million 
borrowing availability would have been higher at year end if not for several factors  including the duplication of a significant letter of credit letters of credit are added to funded debt in determining availability and an unusually high cash balance  due in part to over committed borrowings 
we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to divestitures of certain of our businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
off balance sheet arrangements an indirect wholly owed subsidiary of katy  savannah energy systems company sesco  owns a waste to energy facility  in savannah  georgia 
sesco is under contract with the resource recovery development authority the authority for the city of savannah the city to receive and dispose of the city s solid waste through under a service agreement the service agreement 
the authority issued million of industrial revenue bonds in and lent the proceeds to sesco for the acquisition and construction of the facility under a loan agreement between sesco and the authority the loan agreement 
sesco s ability to repay under the loan agreement is dependent upon money it receives as a result of contract obligations of the city to deliver minimum quantities of waste and for the authority to pay a related disposal fee  a component of which is the debt service for the loan 
as of december   million of the bonds remained outstanding 
on march   the company and sesco signed agreements that would effectively turn over operation of the facility to a third party 
we anticipate a final closing on these agreements during april of this party would essentially assume sesco s position in various contracts relating to the facility s operation 
see the caption below entitled joint venture arrangement involving sesco 
under the service agreement  sesco is obligated to receive and process a certain amount of waste generated by the city each year  and to produce certain amounts of steam and energy 
the authority is obligated to deliver a certain tonnage of waste generated by the city during each year and to pay a monthly disposal fee  notwithstanding delivery of less than minimum amounts of waste during a given period 
the authority must pay the disposal fee whether or not the facility is operating unless sesco and katy are insolvent  and the facility is deemed incapable of incinerating the required amount of waste 
sesco is liable for liquidated damages if it fails to accept the minimum amount of waste or to meet other performance standards under the service agreement 
the liquidated damages  an off balance sheet risk for katy  are equal to the amount of the bonds outstanding  less million maintained in a debt service reserve trust 
we do not expect non performance by the other parties 
sesco s obligations under the service agreement are  except in limited circumstances relating to a default by the authority  guaranteed by katy 
the obligation of sesco to repay the loan is dependent upon debt service payments received from the authority as part of the monthly disposal fee 
the obligation of the authority to provide for debt service payments is expected to be fulfilled from money derived from the city under a waste disposal contract 
if all other parties fail to fulfill their respective obligations to provide funds for payments of principal and interest and premium on the bonds under the contract documents  the city is unconditionally obligated to provide the funds for such payments even during periods of force majeure  unless sesco and katy are insolvent  and the facility is deemed to be incapable of incinerating the required amount of waste 
the obligation of the city to make such payments constitutes a general obligation of the city for which its full faith and credit are irrevocably pledged 
with the consent of the city and other parties to the contracts and without the approval of the holders of the bonds  sesco may be replaced as operator of the facility if the experience of the substitute operator in operating mass burn resource recovery facilities similar to the facility equals or exceeds that of katy and sesco  and katy may be replaced as guarantor of sesco s performance under the service agreement by a third party  whose senior unsecured long term debt is rated investment grade or better 
to the extent the above qualifications are not met  the consent of the majority of bondholders would be required to authorize the replacement 
based on consultations with outside legal counsel  sesco has a legally enforceable right to offset amounts it owes to the authority under the loan agreement against amounts that are owed from the authority under the service agreement 
accordingly  the amounts owed to and due from sesco have been netted for financial reporting purposes and are not shown on the consolidated statements of financial position 
following are scheduled principal repayments on the loan agreement and the industrial revenue bonds in thousands total  joint venture arrangement involving sesco on march   the company and sesco signed agreements that would effectively turn over operation of the facility to a third party 
the closing of the agreements is contingent upon receipt of certain consents from interested parties  and we anticipate a final closing during april of the company has entered into these agreements as a result of evaluations of sesco s business 
the company has determined that sesco is not a core component to katy s long term strategic goals 
moreover  katy does not feel it has the management expertise to deal with certain risks and uncertainties presented by the operation  given that sesco is the only waste to energy facility in which the company has an interest 
katy has explored options for divesting sesco for a number of years  and management feels that the agreements contemplated currently offer a reasonable exit strategy from this business 
the third party would essentially assume sesco s position in various contracts relating to the facility s operation 
under the agreements  sesco will contribute its assets and liabilities except for its liability under the loan agreement to a joint venture 
while sesco will maintain a limited partnership interest in the joint venture  the third party will have control of the joint venture 
sesco will give a note payable as consideration for the transaction of  certain amounts may be due to sesco upon expiration of the service agreement in also  the third party may purchase sesco s remaining interest in the joint venture at that time 
also  if the service agreement were extended  further amounts would be due to sesco from the third party 
while sesco and therefore the company will maintain an investment in the joint venture  it will have a zero value since no positive return will be realized from it and sesco will not be able to exert any meaningful level of control over it 
upon completion of the transaction  the company expects to recognize a loss consisting of a charge for the discounted value of the  note  which is payable over seven years  and an amount representing the carrying value of certain assets contributed to the joint venture  consisting primarily of machinery spare parts 
it should be noted that all of sesco s long lived assets were written to zero value at december   so no additional impairment will be required 
however  the company will incur higher than normal expenses related to sesco as a result of legal fees and other costs to complete the transaction  and higher operational expenses during as a result of the ceasing of cost capitalization ie  costs previously considered capital expenditures are now being expensed in given the zero book value of long lived assets 
on a going forward basis  katy would expect little if any income statement activity as a result of its involvement in the joint venture  and katy s balance sheet will carry the note payable mentioned above 
we have not booked any amounts receivable or other assets relating to amounts that may be received at the time the service agreement expires  given their uncertainty 
contractual obligations and commercial obligations katy s obligations are summarized below in thousands of dollars due in less due in due in due after contractual cash obligations total than year years years years revolving credit facility b   term loans    preferred interest of subsidiary   operating leases      other total contractual obligations      due in less due in due in due after other commercial commitments total than year years years years commercial letters of credit stand by letters of credit    guarantees a     total commercial commitments     a as discussed in the off balance sheet arrangements section above  sesco  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of katy  operates a waste to energy facility  under which it has certain contractual obligations  and for which katy provides certain guarantees 
if sesco is not able to perform its obligations under the contracts  under certain circumstances sesco and katy could be subject to damages equal to the amount of industrial revenue bonds outstanding which financed construction of the facility less amounts held by certain trusts in debt service reserve funds 
katy and sesco do not anticipate non performance by parties to the contracts 
see the off balance sheet arrangements section above and note to consolidated financial statements 
b as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section above  the entire revolving credit facility is classified as a current liability on the consolidated statements of financial position as a result of the combination in the new credit agreement of lockbox agreements on katy s depository bank accounts and a subjective material adverse effect mae clause 
the revolving credit facility expires on june  other items effect of transactions with related and certain other parties in connection with the contico acquisition on january   we entered into building lease agreements with newcastle industries  inc newcastle is majority owned by lester i 
miller  who was appointed to our board of directors on january   and who resigned in september newcastle also is the holder of the preferred interest in contico 
also  several additional properties utilized by contico are leased directly from lester i 
miller 
rental expense for these properties approximates historical market rates 
related party rental expense for the year ending december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we paid newcastle million of preferred dividends for the year ended december   compared to million for each of the years ended december  and in connection with the recapitalization  we agreed with the holder of the preferred interest in contico to redeem  at a discount  approximately half of such interest 
as a consequence of the redemption  annual preferred cash distributions required to be paid pursuant to the purchase agreement were lower in  and will decrease in future years by approximately million from fiscal year and levels 
kohlberg  whose affiliate holds all  shares of our convertible preferred stock  provides ongoing management oversight and advisory services to katy 
we paid  for such services in  and expect to pay  annually in future years 
restructuring efforts and severance charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance and restructuring charges 
approximately million was related to severance payments 
these payments related to the closing of the former corporate headquarters in englewood  colorado and an adjunct corporate office in chicago and the related terminations of employees  as well as severance paid to employees at operating divisions in headcount reduction efforts 
approximately million of the charges related to a consultant working with us on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
approximately million of the charges related to transition activities within the company 
other costs related to manufacturing restructuring initiatives at contico 
during the third quarter of  we recorded million of severance and restructuring charges  of which million related to the payment or accrual of severance and other payments associated with the management transition resulting from the recapitalization 
additionally  million of costs were incurred related primarily to consultants working with the company on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
during the second quarter of  contico undertook restructuring efforts that resulted in severance payments to various individuals 
forty three employees  including two members of contico and katy executive management  received severance benefits 
total severance costs were million 
also during the second quarter of  the company recognized severance and exit costs associated with the closing of a warehouse facility and consolidation of certain administrative functions  both of which relate to the mop  broom and brush business 
seven warehouse employees and administrative employees were being affected by these actions 
total severance and exit costs associated with these efforts were million 
we incurred charges for non cancelable rent and other exit costs associated with the planned closure of our englewood  colorado corporate office 
total costs recognized in the second quarter of were million 
an additional million was added to this cost estimate in the fourth quarter see above 
during the first quarter of  woods undertook a restructuring effort that involved reductions in senior management headcount as well as facilities closings 
we closed facilities in loogootee and bloomington  indiana  as well as the hong kong office of katy international  a subsidiary which coordinates sourcing of products from asia 
sixteen management and administrative employees received severance packages 
total severance and other exit costs were million 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company implemented a workforce reduction that reduced headcount by approximately employees affected were primarily in general and administrative functions  with the largest number of affected employees coming from the maintenance products group 
the workforce reduction included severance and related costs for certain employees 
total severance and related costs was million 
in june  we began a restructuring plan for our electrical electronics businesses as a result of weaker than expected sales performance and lower margins 
the cost of the restructuring  which included severance costs related to the elimination of management employees  resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings in the second quarter of of approximately million 
additionally  plant personnel levels were reduced in excess of persons and unfilled administrative positions were eliminated 
as of december  accrued severance and restructuring totaled million which will be paid through the year the table below summarizes the future obligations for severance and restructuring charges detailed above thousands of dollars thereafter total payments  outlook for we anticipate a continuation of the difficult economic conditions and business environment in  which will present challenges in maintaining top line net sales 
in particular  we expect to see softness continue in the restaurant  travel and hotel markets to which we sell cleaning products 
we have a significant concentration of customers in the mass market retail  discount  and do it yourself market channels 
our ability to maintain and increase our sales levels depends in part on our ability to retain and improve relationships with these customers 
we face the continuing challenge of recovering or offsetting costs increases for raw materials 
gross margins are expected to improve during as we realize the benefits of various profit enhancing strategies begun in these strategies include sourcing previously manufactured products  as well as locating new sources for products already sourced outside the company 
we have significantly reduced headcount  and continue to examine issues related to excess facilities 
cost of goods sold is subject to variability in the prices for certain raw materials  most significantly thermoplastic resins used by contico in the manufacture of plastic products 
we are also exposed to price changes for copper used by woods and woods canada  corrugated packaging material and other raw materials 
we have not employed any hedging techniques in the past  but are evaluating alternatives in the area of commodity price risk 
we anticipate mitigating these risks in part by creating efficiencies in and improvements to our production processes 
selling  general and administrative costs are expected to remain stable or improve as a percentage of sales from levels 
cost reduction efforts are ongoing throughout the company 
our corporate office has relocated  and we expect to maintain modest headcount and rental costs 
we have begun the process of transferring most back office functions of our wilen subsidiary from atlanta to st 
louis  the headquarters of contico 
we will evaluate the possibility of further consolidation of administrative processes at our other companies 
it should be noted that we may incur further unusual charges during for potential restructuring efforts related to decisions on manufacturing and distribution facilities  as well as administrative operations 
these charges could be for any or all of severance  plant closure costs and asset impairments 
we are also pursuing a strategy of developing the katy maintenance group kmg 
this process involves bundling certain products of the janitorial sanitation business of contico  wilen  glit microtron and disco for customers in the janitorial sanitation markets 
the new organization would allow customers to order certain products from all of the companies using a single purchase order  and billing and collection would be consolidated as well 
in addition to administrative efficiencies  we believe that combining sales and marketing efforts of these entities will allow us a unique marketing opportunity to have improved delivery of both product and customer service 
we do not expect significant financial benefits from this project in  but believe it to be a key to improving profitability and the long term success of the company interest expense is expected to be significantly lower during as opposed to  given a full year of lower debt levels as a result of the recapitalization 
also  we have benefited from lower prevailing rates of interest in recent months as a result of variable rate borrowing facilities 
we cannot predict the future levels of these interest rates 
the effective tax rate for is expected to be higher than the federal statutory rate as a result of state and foreign income tax provisions 
the effective tax rate is also subject to ongoing adjustments as a result of the company s ongoing evaluations of its abilities to utilize certain deferred tax assets  particularly net operating losses 
we are continually evaluating the possibility of divesting certain businesses 
this strategy would allow us to de leverage our current financial position and allow available cash  as well as management focus  to be directed at core business activities

these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to results that differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf  including  among other things increases in the cost of  or in some cases continuation of the current price levels of  plastic resins  copper  paper board packaging  and other raw materials 
our inability to reduce product costs  including manufacturing  sourcing  freight  and other product costs 
our inability to reduce administrative costs through consolidation of functions and systems improvements 
our inability to achieve product price increases  especially as they relate to potentially higher raw material costs 
the potential impact of losing lines of business at large retail outlets in the discount and do it yourself markets 
competition from foreign competitors 
the potential impact of new distribution channels  such as e commerce  negatively impacting us and our existing channels 
the potential impact of rising interest rates on our eurodollar based credit facility 
our inability to meet covenants associated with the new credit agreement 
labor issues  including union activities that require an increase in production costs or lead to a strike  thus impairing production and decreasing sales 
we are also subject to labor relations issues at entities involved in our supply chain  including both suppliers and those involved in transportation and shipping 
changes in significant laws and government regulations affecting environmental compliance and income taxes 
our inability to sell certain assets to raise cash and de leverage its financial condition 
words and phrases such as expects  estimates  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates and the like are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the results referred to in forward looking statements may differ materially from actual results because they involve estimates  assumptions and uncertainties 
we are not obligated to update or revise any forward looking statements or to advise changes in the assumptions on which they are based  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
all forward looking statements should be viewed with caution 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in our financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payment from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of large sized customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets also include net operating loss carry forwards primarily due to the significant operating losses incurred during recent years 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not such assets will not be recovered  taking into consideration historical net income losses  projected future income losses and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   the valuation allowance was increased by million  reducing our effective tax rate benefit to and our total income tax benefit to million 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance requirements based on future operating results and business acquisitions and dispositions 
as circumstances change that require an increase or decrease in our income tax valuation allowance  the change in valuation allowance will be reflected in current operations through our income tax provision benefit 
workers compensation and product liabilities we make payments for workers compensation and product liability claims generally through the use of a third party claims administrator 
we have purchased insurance coverage for large claims over our self insured retention levels 
our workers compensation and health benefit liabilities are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  and other relevant factors 
while we believe that our liabilities for workers compensation and product liability claims of million as of december   are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board authorized the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires intangible assets to be recognized if they arise from contractual or legal rights or are separable  ie  it is feasible that they may be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  exchanged or pledged 
as a result  it is likely that more intangible assets will be recognized under sfas no 
than under its predecessor  accounting principles board apb opinion no 
although in some instances previously recognized intangibles will be subsumed into goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is to be performed on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment determined in accordance with sfas no 
or one level lower 
goodwill will no longer be allocated to other long lived assets for impairment testing under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  goodwill on equity method investments will no longer be amortized  however  it will continue to be tested for impairment in accordance with apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
under sfas no 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
instead they will be carried at the lower of cost or market value and tested for impairment at least annually 
all other recognized intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although goodwill on business combinations consummated after july  will not be amortized 
in addition  goodwill on prior business combinations will cease to be amortized 
the company is unable at this time to determine the impact that this statement will have on goodwill and intangible assets at the time of adoption in the first quarter of  or whether a cumulative effect adjustment will be required upon adoption 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded an impairment of million on the long lived assets of its wilen subsidiary  as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
however  even considering this impairment  the terms of the recently completed recapitalization see note to consolidated financial statements indicate that the fair value of the company may be less than the carrying value represented on the consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  the company recognizes the possibility of impairments of goodwill and certain intangibles upon adoption in the first quarter of in august   the fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
previously  two accounting models existed for long lived assets to be disposed of  as sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb opinion this statement establishes a single model based on the framework of sfas no 
this statement also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while the company is still evaluating the potential impact of the statement  it anticipates that this statement could have an impact on its financial reporting as it liberalizes the presentation of discontinued operations 
if the company were to divest of certain businesses that are under consideration  katy anticipates they would possibly qualify as discontinued operations under sfas no 
 whereas they would have not met the requirements of discontinued operations treatment under apb opinion environmental and other contingencies the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability superfund act or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities amounts that it deems reasonable and believes that any liability with respect to these matters in excess of the accrual will not be material 
the ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matter in which the company is currently involved relates to the wj smith site 
in  the united states environmental protection agency usepa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the wj smith site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
with regard to non environmental contingencies  in december  banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods  a subsidiary of katy  and against certain past and then present officers and directors and former owners of woods  alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
all of the foregoing is alleged to have occurred prior to our purchase of woods 
the plaintiff also alleges that it made loans to an entity controlled by certain officers and directors based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damage under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of million and is requesting treble damages under rico 
because certain procedural issues have not yet been fully adjudicated in this litigation  it is not possible at this time for the company to reasonably determine an outcome or accurately estimate the range of potential exposure 
we may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement through which we acquired woods  and under state  federal and common law 
in addition  the purchase price under the purchase agreement may be subject to adjustment as a result of the claims made by banco del atlantico 
the extent or limit of any such recourse cannot be predicted at this time 
we also have a number of product liability and worker s compensation claims pending against us and our subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome for such claims 
with respect to the product liability and worker s compensation claims  we have provided for our share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent our best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
although we believe that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and temporary cash investments 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments relating to either of these exposures 
our interest obligations on outstanding debt are indexed from short term eurodollar rates 
the holder of the preferred interest in contico redeemed with katy  at a discount  approximately half of such interest at the time of the recapitalization 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible preferred stock for the purpose of redeeming approximately of the preferred interest 
the holder will retain approximately of the preferred interest  or a stated value of million 
additionally  in connection with the recapitalization  the agreement governing a put option was amended to  among other things  provide that in the event of a change of control  or at any time during the period beginning on the earlier to occur of june   or the date at which all indebtedness incurred by us in connection with the recapitalization has been paid in full and lenders have released all security interests in connection with such indebtedness  and ending on january   the holder of the preferred interest shall have the right to require us to purchase from them any portion of their preferred interest at its stated value 
in the same amendment  provisions regarding our call option on the preferred interest were amended to allow us to purchase the outstanding preferred interest at stated value at any time following the recapitalization 
see note to consolidated financial statements the following table presents our financial instruments  rates of interest and indications of fair value expected maturity dates thousands of dollars assets thereafter total fair value temporary cash investments fixed rate average interest rate long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt       average interest rate preferred interest of subsidiary fixed rate obligation   a average interest rate a the company cannot estimate the fair value of the preferred interest due to lack of a market 
the fair value of the preferred interest in contico is impacted by two factors the rate of interest paid on the stated amount  and the market price of katy s common stock 
during  market rates for similar instruments decreased  which would have the effect of increasing the fair value of the preferred interest 
also during  the value of katy s common stock declined  which caused the fair value of the preferred interest to decrease 
upon exercise of the put option  the holder would receive  shares of katy common stock  implying a per share value when divided into the post redemption value of million 
katy s stock closed at on january   the date of the contico acquisition  and closed at on december
