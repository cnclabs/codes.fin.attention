item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should be read in conjunction with these statements and the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  bad debts and income taxes 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
talbots believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for adjustments to inventory balances based on estimated future markdowns on current inventory using information related to inventory levels  historical markdown trends and forecasted future markdowns 
if market conditions were to decline  talbots may be 
table of contents required to mark down prices at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction in earnings at the time the markdowns are actually taken 
management believes that at year end fiscal  this allowance is sufficient based on current inventory levels  historical markdown trends and reasonable markdown forecasts 
reductions in sales and margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
actual returns may vary and possibly have a negative impact on future sales and earnings as the actual returns are realized 
management believes that at year end fiscal  its reserve is sufficient based on current sales  return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
talbots maintains a customer loyalty program in which customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a purchase level on their talbots charge account 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards against future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards expire one year from the date of issuance 
expense associated with the accrued award is recognized at the time of the initial customer purchase and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense based on purchase levels  actual awards issued and historic redemption rates 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could negatively impact earnings 
management believes at year end fiscal  its current allowance is sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
talbots maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of talbots charge customers to make required payments 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors including the level of accounts receivable balances  historic charge off levels and projected future charge off levels 
delinquent accounts are generally written off automatically after a period of delinquency 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
additionally  a reserve is maintained based on a percentage of the outstanding balance  historical charge offs and estimated future charge offs 
if the credit worthiness of talbots customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management believes that at year end fiscal  the current allowance for doubtful accounts balance is sufficient in light of portfolio balance  historical charge offs and reasonable charge off forecasts 
talbots records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event it is determined that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management believes that no valuation allowance is currently needed based on assumptions regarding future taxable income
