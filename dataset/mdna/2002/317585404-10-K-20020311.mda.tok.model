quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the company s senior management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
senior management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank board adopts an asset liability policy within the parameters of the overall fii asset liability policy and utilizes an asset liability committee comprised of senior management of the bank under the direction of the bank s board 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within one year  was million  or of total assets 
accordingly  over the one year period following december   the company will have million more in liabilities re pricing than assets 
generally if rate sensitive assets re price sooner than rate sensitive liabilities  earnings will be positively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment  earnings will generally be negatively impacted 
if rate sensitive liabilities re price sooner than rate sensitive assets then generally earnings will be negatively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment earnings will generally be positively impacted 
management believes that the negative gap position at december  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits were assumed to become rate sensitive over time  with     and of such deposits assumed to re price in the periods of less than days  to days  to days  to years  to years and more than years  respectively 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
while management believes the assumptions used in modeling the gap are reasonable  there can be no assurances

amounts shown include principal balance net of deferred loan fees and costs  unamortized premiums and discounts 
amounts shown include guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in corporation s junior subordinated debentures 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk discussed below  rather than gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
net interest income at risk analysis in addition to the gap analysis  management uses a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands static   the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would increase net interest income by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
conversely  a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome
