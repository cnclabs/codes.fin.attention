item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are one of the world s largest manufacturers and providers of high quality natural and synthetic graphite and carbon based products and services  offering energy solutions to industry leading customers worldwide 
we manufacture graphite and carbon electrodes and cathodes  used primarily in electric arc furnace steel production and aluminum smelting 
we also manufacture other natural and synthetic graphite and carbon products used in  and provide services to  the fuel cell power generation  electronics  semiconductor and transportation markets 
we believe that we have the leading market share in all of our major product lines 
we have over years of experience in the research and development of graphite and carbon technology  and currently hold numerous patents related to this technology 
we are a global business  selling our products and engineering and technical services in more than countries 
we have manufacturing facilities strategically located in brazil  mexico  south africa  france  spain  russia and the us  and a planned joint venture manufacturing facility located in china  which  subject to receipt of required chinese governmental approvals  is expected to commence operations in realignment in early  we launched a strategic initiative to strengthen our competitive position and to change our corporate vision from an industrial products company to an energy solutions company 
in connection with this initiative  we have realigned our company and management around two new operating divisions  our graphite power systems division and our advanced energy technology division 
we believe that this realignment is enabling us to develop and implement strategies uniquely designed to maximize the value of each of our businesses 
we may also adopt compensation plans designed to incentivize management of each division on a basis consistent with its particular strategies 
in addition  we believe that this transparent  unified divisional focus has and will continue to better enable us to structure and enter into strategic alliances beneficial to each respective division 
we are also realigning the corporate organizational structure of our subsidiaries 
upon completion of this corporate realignment  most of the businesses of each division will be segregated into separate companies along divisional lines 
in addition  because most of the operations  net sales and growth opportunities of our graphite power systems division are located outside the us  most of its operations will be held by our swiss subsidiary or its subsidiaries 
most of our technology will continue to be held by our us subsidiaries 
as part of our new major cost savings plan announced in january  we are using opportunities created by this corporate organizational realignment to change our us benefit plans  improve cash management  intellectual property management and corporate services delivery  reduce associated costs  reduce taxes and reallocate intercompany debt 
this reallocation of intercompany debt will better match intercompany debt with cash flow from operations 
debt service on our intercompany debt provides an important source of funds to repay our debt to third parties  including the senior facilities and the senior notes 
our divisions our graphite power systems division manufactures and delivers high quality graphite and carbon electrodes and cathodes and related services that are key components of the conductive power systems used to produce steel  aluminum and other non ferrous metals 
graphite electrodes are consumed in the production of steel in electric arc furnaces  the steel making technology used by all mini mills 
mini mills constitute the higher long term growth sector of the steel industry 
graphite electrodes are also consumed in the refining steel in ladle furnaces and in other smelting processes 
our graphite electrodes accounted for about of this division s net sales during carbon electrodes are used in the production of silicon metal  a raw material primarily used in the manufacture of aluminum 
graphite and carbon cathodes are used in aluminum smelting 
our advanced energy technology division develops  manufactures and sells high quality  highly engineered natural and synthetic graphite and carbon based energy technologies  products and services for both established and high growth potential markets 
we currently sell these products primarily to the transportation  chemical  petrochemical  fuel cell power generation and electronic thermal management markets 
in addition  we provide cost effective technical services to a broad range of markets and license our proprietary technology in markets where we do not anticipate engaging in manufacturing ourselves 
we believe that this division will be successful because of our patented and proprietary technologies related to graphite and carbon materials science and our processing and manufacturing technology 
natural graphite based products  including flexible graphite  are developed and manufactured by our subsidiary  graftech 
our synthetic graphite and carbon based products are developed and manufactured by our advanced graphite materials and advanced carbon materials business units  respectively 
these business units include our former graphite and carbon specialties businesses 
our technology licensing and technical services are marketed and sold by our ht business unit 
cost reduction plans overview 
ucar s board of directors adopted a global restructuring and rationalization plan in september and we launched additional initiatives to enhance the plan in october the plan strengthened our position as a low cost supplier 
it also enabled us to largely maintain cash flow from operations before antitrust fines and net settlements and expenses  securities class action and shareholder derivative settlements and restructuring payments  gross profit margins and operating profit margins despite the difficult economic conditions that generally affected the steel and metals industries for most of the period since september the plan is now completed 
by the end of  we delivered recurring annualized run rate cost savings of million 
in january  we announced a new major cost savings plan 
like the plan  we believe that the plan is by far the most aggressive major cost reduction plan being implemented in the graphite and carbon industry 
plan 
in january  we announced a new major cost savings plan designed to generate cost savings to strengthen our balance sheet 
the key elements of the plan consist of o the rationalization of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our higher cost facilities and the incremental expansion of capacity at our lower cost facilities  o the redesign and implementation of changes in our us benefit plans for active and retired employees  o the implementation of work process changes  including consolidating and streamlining order fulfillment  purchasing  finance and accounting  and human resource processes  along with the identification and implementation of outsourcing opportunities  o the implementation of additional plant and corporate overhead cost reduction projects  and o the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  consistent with the operational realignment of our businesses into two operating divisions  to generate significant tax savings 
as part of the plan  we intend to mothball our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy 
we expect the mothballing to be completed during the first half 
these operations have the capacity to manufacture  metric tons of graphite electrodes annually 
after the shutdown of our operations in tennessee in the third quarter  these operations are our highest cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations 
we expect to further incrementally expand graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our facilities in mexico  france and spain over the next twelve months 
after the mothballing and incremental expansion  our total annual graphite electrode manufacturing capacity will remain about  metric tons 
we have identified a number of additional plant and overhead cost reduction projects 
one of the major projects is employee benefit plan redesign 
we have redesigned and implemented changes in our retiree medical insurance plan and our us retirement and savings plans for active and retired employees 
these benefit plan changes will result in annual cost savings of more than million 
we expect that about half of the other plant and overhead cost reduction projects will be completed in the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries is expected to be completed in the first half and result in substantial tax savings 
as a result of the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  the effective tax rate for  excluding non recurring charges or benefits associated with the realignment  is expected to be 
we intend to sell real estate  non strategic businesses and certain other non strategic assets over the next two years 
we anticipate that the aggregate estimated pre tax  cash proceeds from these sales will total million by the end of the non strategic businesses contributed net sales of about million in we estimate that the plan will generate cumulative cost savings of about million by the end of  million by the end of and million by the end of  and recurring annual savings of million by the end of these savings are additive to those which we achieved by the end of under the plan that is now completed 
the following table summarizes the targeted savings under the plan summary of projected annual cost savings for the year ended december  cumulative pre tax dollars in millions cost of sales graphite power systems division advanced energy technology division total cost of sales overhead costs total cost of sales and overhead costs interest expense savings due to the plan tax expense total savings we believe that the plan will o further strengthen our position and our competitive advantage as a low cost supplier to the steel and other metals industries  o better enable us to largely maintain our gross profit margin and operating margin during the current global economic downturn  o rationalize our capacity to manufacture both higher value added supersize ultra high power graphite electrodes as well as cost competitive high power small diameter graphite electrodes for ladle furnaces  o further improve our position to benefit  in terms of operations  earnings and cash flow from operations  from the expected cyclical recovery in electric arc furnace steel production  and o enable us to further reduce total debt  which should result in reductions in interest expense interest expense reductions do not take into account higher interest expense resulting from the sale of the senior notes 
as we undertake the mothballing of our italian graphite electrode operations during the first half  we expect working capital requirements to temporarily increase similar to what we experienced with the closure of our us graphite electrode operations 
net debt levels will increase during the first half as a result of these working capital needs and the seasonally lower graphite electrode sales 
the plan requires about million of cash exit costs and resulted in million of non cash restructuring charges and impairment losses on long lived assets 
these costs are additive to the million of cash exit costs and million of non cash restructuring charges and impairment losses on long lived assets related to the shutdown of our us graphite electrode operations 
the mothballing of our graphite electrode operations in italy will enable us to avoid annually an average of million of otherwise necessary capital expenditures 
we expect to make the planned incremental expansions of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity for capital expenditures of million and complete such expansion within twelve months 
plan 
the key elements of our global restructuring and rationalization plan announced in september and enhanced in october included o the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in canada and germany  and o the consolidation of administrative functions with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to tennessee which have subsequently been relocated to delaware and our european headquarters to switzerland 
we also downsized our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in russia 
as a result of the plan and other cost savings initiatives  we have reduced our average graphite electrode production cost per metric ton by the end of by since the fourth quarter 
other cost reduction activities 
since  we have initiated other cost reduction activities 
some of these activities will continue while the plan is being implemented 
we have evaluated every aspect of our supply chain and improved and continue to improve performance through realignment and standardization of critical business processes  standardization of enterprise wide systems  and improvement of information technology infrastructures and interfaces with trading partners 
we reduced inventory levels from by about  or to about million  by the end of and reduced our cash cycle time  as compared to  by about by the end of during late and into the first quarter  our graphite specialties business  which now is part of our advanced graphite materials business unit  experienced significant adverse change that indicated the need for assessing the recoverability of the long lived assets of this business 
these assets were located primarily at our plant in clarksburg  west virginia 
we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and concluded they were below the respective carrying amounts 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter for the unrecoverable portion of these assets  effectively writing down the carrying value of the long lived assets to their estimated fair value of million 
in  we restructured the business 
the key elements of the restructuring included elimination of certain product lines and rationalization of operations of the remaining product lines 
accordingly  in the first quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
in the third quarter  based on subsequent developments  we decided not to demolish certain buildings 
accordingly  we reversed million of the charge related thereto 
the million balance of the charge related primarily to severance costs 
in the third quarter  we recorded an impairment loss of million on long lived cathode assets in connection with the re sourcing of our us cathode production to our facilities in brazil and france and the related reduction of certain graphite electrode manufacturing capacity in those facilities 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million charge in connection with a corporate restructuring involving a workforce reduction of about employees 
the functional areas affected include finance  accounting  sales  marketing and administration 
the charge consists primarily of severance costs 
in the second quarter  we recorded a million charge for restructuring and impairment loss on long lived assets related to the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in clarksville and columbia  tennessee 
in  these operations were our highest cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations 
we expect that the shutdown will result in total annual cost savings of million and will enable us to avoid about million in otherwise necessary capital expenditures 
certain of these cost savings were realized in and the balance will be delivered in the shutdown was completed on schedule near the end of the third quarter 
we incrementally expanded graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our facilities in mexico  spain and south africa for a capital investment of about million 
in the third quarter  we recorded a million charge for restructuring and impairment loss on long lived assets related to the realignment of our businesses into our advanced energy technology division and graphite power systems division  the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the shutdown of our coal calcining operations located in niagara falls  new york 
we are shutting down our coal calcining operations primarily because we have entered into a five year agreement to purchase calcined coal from a third party at a lower net effective cost than we can produce it for ourselves 
the shutdown was completed at the end of as part of the business realignment  we have centralized management functions of our advanced energy technology division in cleveland  ohio  and management functions of our graphite power systems division in etoy  switzerland 
on december   we relocated our corporate headquarters  consisting of about employees  from nashville  tennessee  to wilmington  delaware 
the charge relates primarily to a workforce reduction of employees 
in the third quarter  we reversed million of prior restructuring charges based on revised lower estimates of workforce reductions and plant closure costs and we reclassified million of prior restructuring charges related to on site waste disposal post monitoring costs to the other long term obligations 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded an impairment loss on long lived and other assets of million  million of which was associated with the mothballing of our italian graphite electrode operations 
we also recorded a million non cash restructuring charge  million of which was associated with our italian operations and million of which was associated with the shutdown of our us graphite electrode operations in addition to the charge recorded in the second quarter 
power of one business transformation initiative we began to implement in and we are continuing to implement a global business transformation initiative entitled power of one 
power of one is a coordinated global self assessment and business process rationalization and transformation initiative driving one consistent theme throughout our organization becoming the best 
we believe that the initiative is accelerating development and implementation of business opportunities and developing leadership skills more broadly within all management levels as well as supporting our efforts to reduce costs and working capital needs  improve efficiencies and product quality  shorten cycle times and achieve best in class performance 
through december   our investment in the initiative included about million of consulting fees and million of capital expenditures  primarily for advanced planning and scheduling supply chain software and global treasury management systems 
we believe that most of the future investment for this initiative will be funded from realized cost savings 
effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi group inc pursuant to which cgi became the delivery arm for our global information technology service requirements  including the design and implementation of our global information and advanced manufacturing and demand planning processes  using jd edwards software 
through this contract  we are transforming our information technology service capability into an efficient  high quality enabler for our global supply chain initiatives as well as a contributor to our cost reduction objectives 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi manages our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
through this contract  we believe that we will be able to leverage the resources of cgi to assist us in achieving our information technology goals and our target cost savings 
as part of the plan  we are also implementing global work process changes  including consolidating and streamlining our order fulfillment  purchasing  finance and accounting and human resource processes  along with the identification and implementation of outsourcing opportunities  targeted for completion by the end of global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions affecting the markets for our products fluctuate 
throughout and the first quarter  electric arc furnace steel production declined as a result of adverse global and regional economic conditions 
a recovery began in the second quarter that lasted through mid beginning in mid  economic conditions began to weaken in north america  becoming more severe in the fourth quarter 
even with this weakening  worldwide electric arc furnace steel production was million metric tons in about of total steel production 
the economic weakening in north america continued and became more severe in more than steel companies in the us filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code during the past two years 
moreover  notwithstanding a substantial decrease in steel production in the us  steel inventories  particularly those held by steel service centers  remain high relative to shipments 
in march  president bush announced his decision to impose tariffs of up to on most imported steel as part of a broader plan to rescue the nation s financially troubled steel industry 
we cannot predict at this time whether and to what extent this development will impact us 
the impact of the economic weakness in north america on other regional economies became more severe during steel production declined in brazil in the second and third quarters by about as compared to the second and third quarters 
this decline was caused both by shortages of electricity brought on by a drought that reduced hydroelectric power generation although brazil is now beginning to experience some relief from the drought as well as by the weakening in global economic conditions 
brazil may also be impacted by the recent currency crisis occurring in argentina 
there has also been a weakening in the demand for steel in asia except for china where electric arc furnace steel production has remained relatively stable 
this global economic weakness has been exacerbated by the impact on economic conditions of the terrorist acts in the us in september we believe that worldwide electric arc furnace steel production declined in by about as compared to and is about the same as compared to a total of about million metric tons  about of total steel production 
these fluctuations in electric arc furnace steel production resulted in corresponding fluctuations in demand for graphite electrodes 
we estimate that worldwide graphite electrode demand increased by about in as compared to  but declined by about in as compared to overall pricing worldwide was weak throughout most of this period 
however  we implemented increases in local currency selling prices of our graphite electrodes in and early in europe  the asia pacific region  the middle east and south africa 
recently  we have not been able to maintain all of these price increases 
we continue to face pricing pressures worldwide 
we are experiencing intense competition in the graphite electrode industry 
one of our us competitors  carbide graphite group  filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code in october in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we have reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us our unpaid trade receivables from steel companies in the us that have filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code during the past two years have aggregated only of net sales of graphite electrodes in the us during the same period 
our volume of graphite electrodes sold increased by in as compared to  but declined by about in as compared to the decline in our volume of graphite electrodes sold in as compared to was due to the decline in electric arc furnace steel production as well as our efforts to implement and maintain local currency selling price increases and our efforts to seek to minimize credit risks 
in and  demand and prices for most of our other products sold to the metals and transportation industries were adversely affected by the same global and regional economic conditions that affected graphite electrodes 
in the second quarter  however  worldwide demand by customers for many of these products began to gradually recover 
during  demand for most of these products as a group was relatively stable 
overall pricing did not strengthen 
the global and regional economic conditions that have impacted demand and prices for graphite electrodes since mid have also similarly impacted demand and prices for most of these products other than graphite cathodes 
demand and prices for graphite cathodes has remained relatively strong since the recovery began in primarily due to construction of new aluminum smelters using graphite cathodes  even as old smelters using carbon cathodes are removed from service 
we believe that business conditions for most of our products other than cathodes will remain challenging through and that a recovery in the steel  metals and transportation industries will not occur until the second half  at the earliest 
assuming economic conditions are the same in as they were in the fourth quarter  we expect a modest increase in our volume of graphite electrodes sold in the second half primarily due to an increase in our market share as we continue to implement our enterprise selling and other strategies 
we expect prices to weaken in as compared to  primarily in north america 
we expect our cost reductions to largely mitigate the impact on gross profit of continued pressure on net sales 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates by the us federal reserve board and the european central bank  changes in tax and fiscal policies by the us and other governments  the occurrence of further terrorist acts and developments including increases in security  transportation and other costs  transportation delays and continuing or increased economic uncertainty and weakness resulting from the terrorist acts in the us in september and the war on terrorism  and changes in global and regional economic conditions 
as a result of the terrorist acts of september  we could face higher insurance premiums in the future as well as higher costs associated with maintaining security at our facilities and ensuring that we will have the necessary equipment and data to back up our systems 
strategic alliances we are pursuing strategic alliances that enhance or complement our existing or related businesses and have the potential to generate strong cash flow 
strategic alliances may be in the form of joint venture  licensing  supply or other arrangements that leverage our strengths to achieve cost savings  improve margins and cash flow  and increase net sales and earnings growth 
we have developed a strategic alliance in the cathode business with pechiney  the world s recognized leader in aluminum smelting technology 
to broaden our alliance  in march  we contributed our brazilian cathode manufacturing operations to carbone savoie 
pechiney  the minority owner of carbone savoie  contributed approximately million in cash to carbone savoie as part of this transaction 
the cash contribution is being used to upgrade manufacturing operations in brazil and france  which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 
ownership in carbone savoie remains by us and by pechiney 
under our now broadened alliance  carbone savoie holds our entire cathode manufacturing capacity 
with these upgrades  we believe that we will be positioned as the quality leader in the low cost production of graphite cathodes  the preferred technology for deployment in new aluminum smelting furnaces due to their ability to provide substantial improvements in process efficiency 
our graphite cathodes are sold to pechiney for use in its own plants under a long term supply contract and marketed to its licensees as well as to third parties 
in april  we entered into a joint venture agreement with jilin to produce and sell high quality graphite electrodes in china  which we believe to be the largest market for graphite electrodes in the world 
jilin is the largest producer of graphite electrodes and other graphite and carbon products in china 
we believe that our share of the asian market for graphite electrodes was only about in as compared to our worldwide market share excluding the asian market of about in we believe that this low cost facility will provide us with an excellent platform to expand our market share  both in china and the rest of asia 
under the joint venture agreement  jilin has agreed that the joint venture facilities will be its exclusive facilities for manufacturing inch and inch ultra high power electrodes required by the more modern and efficient electric arc furnaces  which steelmakers are installing in china and the rest of asia as they upgrade their operations 
as a result  jilin will be replacing a portion of its existing production with production by the joint venture 
the joint venture is expected to o have capacity to manufacture about  metric tons of graphite electrodes annually  o configure its facilities so as to be expandable to about  metric tons  o utilize renovated capacity at jilin s main facility in jilin city  and o complete additions at another site in changchun that were begun by jilin 
the new joint venture facility is expected to commence operations in we will contribute million of cash plus technical assistance for a ownership interest in the joint venture 
the completion of the parties capital contributions to the joint venture is subject to the receipt of required chinese governmental approvals 
we have been working with ballard power systems since on developing natural graphite based materials for use in ballard power systems fuel cells for power generation 
in june  our subsidiary  graftech  entered into a new exclusive development and collaboration agreement and a new exclusive long term supply agreement with ballard power systems  which significantly expand the scope and term of the prior agreements 
in addition  ballard power systems became a strategic investor in graftech  investing million in shares of ballard power systems common stock for a equity ownership interest  to support the development and commercialization of natural graphite based materials and components for proton exchange membrane fuel cells 
the scope of the new exclusive development and collaboration agreement includes natural graphite based materials and components  including flow field plates and gas diffusion layers  for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and fuel cell systems for transportation  stationary and portable applications 
the initial term of this agreement extends through under the new supply agreement  we will be the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of natural graphite based materials for ballard power systems fuel cells and fuel cell systems 
we will also be the exclusive manufacturer of natural graphite based components  other than those components that ballard power systems manufactures for itself 
the initial term of this agreement  which contains customary terms and conditions  extends through we have the right to manufacture and sell  after agreed upon release dates  natural graphite based materials and components for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells to other parties in the fuel cell industry 
financing transactions private senior note offering 
in february  we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes at a price of of principal amount 
the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature in the net proceeds from that offering were million 
we used net proceeds from the first million of senior notes sold and of the net proceeds from the balance of the senior notes sold to repay term loans under the senior facilities 
we used the balance of the net proceeds to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility under the senior facilities 
at december   on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the senior notes offering  the application of the net proceeds and the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  the senior facilities would have constituted million of our total debt of million 
repayments of the principal of term loans under the senior facilities  consisting of tranche a term loans and tranche b term loans  with net proceeds from the senior notes were applied to the repayment of each tranche in proportion to the principal amounts thereof then outstanding except to the extent that tranche b lenders elected to decline their proportional prepayment and to scheduled maturities of each tranche in the order in which they were due 
after repayment  the aggregate principal amount payable each year under the tranche a and tranche b term loans is as follows no payments in  or  million in  million in and million in public equity offering 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from that offering were million 
of the net proceeds were used to prepay term loans under the senior facilities 
the balance of the net proceeds will be used to fund growth and expansion of our advanced energy technology division  including growth through acquisitions  and  pending such use  has been applied to reduce outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
senior facilities 
in november  our prior senior secured credit facilities were refinanced and the indenture governing our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes was amended 
in connection with the refinancing  we obtained additional term debt of million 
we undertook the refinancing to enable us to pay antitrust fines  liabilities and expenses and to strengthen our financial condition by extending maturities of some of our debt 
in february  we completed a debt recapitalization 
we obtained the senior facilities  which were amended in october  april  july  december and february the senior facilities consist of a six year term loan facility in the initial amount of million and 
euro 
million  an eight year term loan facility in the initial amount of million and a six year revolving credit facility in the amount of 
euro 
million 
we used the net proceeds from the senior facilities to repay and terminate our prior senior secured credit facilities  to redeem our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed  plus accrued interest  to repay certain other debt and to pay related expenses 
we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  in connection with our debt recapitalization 
the charge includes the redemption premium on the senior subordinated notes  bank  legal  accounting  filing and other fees and expenses  and write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
the debt recapitalization lowered our average annual interest rate  extended the average maturities of our debt and replaced our financial and other covenants 
in light of changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions  our recent financial performance and other factors  we closely monitor our compliance with those covenants 
in february  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit us to issue the senior notes 
in connection with this amendment and completion of the offering of the senior notes  we expect to record an extraordinary charge of million million after tax in the first quarter relating primarily to write off of fees incurred in the first quarter relating to the portion of the tranche a and tranche b term loans that were repaid with net proceeds from that offering 
litigation against our former parent companies initiated by us in february  we commenced a lawsuit against our former parents  mitsubishi and union carbide 
in the lawsuit  we allege  among other things  that certain payments made to our former parents in connection with the recapitalization were unlawful under the general corporation law of the state of delaware  that our former parents were unjustly enriched by receipts from their investments in ucar and that our former parents aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us by our former senior management in connection with illegal graphite electrode price fixing activities 
we are seeking to recover more than billion in damages  including interest 
the defendants have filed motions to dismiss this lawsuit and a motion to disqualify certain of our counsel from representing us in this lawsuit 
we are vigorously opposing those motions 
oral hearings were held on those motions in the first and second quarters 
no decision on those motions has been rendered 
we expect to incur million to million for legal expenses to pursue this lawsuit from the date of filing the complaint through trial 
through december   we had incurred about million of these legal expenses 
antitrust and other litigation against us since  we have been subject to antitrust investigations by antitrust authorities in the us  the european union  canada  japan and korea 
we have also learned that the brazilian antitrust authorities have requested written information from various steel makers in brazil 
in addition  civil antitrust lawsuits have been commenced and threatened against us and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products in the us  canada and elsewhere 
we recorded a pre tax charge against results of operations for in the amount of million as a reserve for estimated potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in april  ucar pled guilty to a one count charge of violating us federal antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a fine in the aggregate amount of million  payable in six annual installments of million  million  million  million  million and million  commencing july  the payments due in  and were timely made 
in january  at our request  the due date of each of the remaining three payments was deferred by one year 
we have finalized discussions with the us department of justice to restructure the payment schedule for the remaining million due 
the revised payment schedule requires a million payment in  a million payment in and  beginning with the second quarter  quarterly payments ranging from million to million through the first quarter 
interest will begin to accrue on the unpaid balance  commencing with the second quarter  at the statutory rate of interest then in effect 
in january  the current statutory rate of interest was per annum 
of the million aggregate amount and before giving effect to the restructured payment schedule  million is treated as a fine and million is treated as imputed interest for accounting purposes 
in march  our canadian subsidiary pled guilty to a one count change of violating canadian antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a fine of cdn 
million 
the payment was timely made 
in october  we became aware that the korean antitrust authority had commenced an investigation as to whether there had been any violations of korean antitrust law by producers and distributors of graphite electrodes 
we have received requests for information from the korean antitrust authority 
we are cooperating with the korean antitrust authority in its continuing investigation 
in connection therewith  we have produced and are producing documents and or witnesses 
in february  we became aware that the korean antitrust authority had issued its examiner s report alleging that we and other producers of graphite electrodes violated the korean antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
the maximum fine  if any  for such a violation is of a company s sales of the relevant product during the period of violation  a maximum fine of about million in our case 
any such fine would be subject to reduction for cooperation 
in march  we were advised that the korean antitrust authority  after holding a hearing on this matter  assessed a fine against us in the amount of million krw approximately  at the exchange rate in effect on march  
five other graphite electrode producers were also fined by the korean antitrust authority in amounts ranging up to  million krw approximately million at the exchange rate in effect on march  
our fine  which represented 
of our sales during the relevant time period and was the lowest fine as a percentage of sales imposed by the korean antitrust authority  was substantially reduced as a result of our cooperation with the authority during their investigation 
in january  the antitrust authority of the european union issued a statement of objections initiating proceedings against us and other producers of graphite electrodes 
the statement alleged that we and other producers violated antitrust laws of the european community and the european economic area in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
in july  that authority issued its decision 
under the decision  that authority assessed a fine of 
euro 
million against ucar resulting from the role of our former management in a graphite electrode price fixing cartel 
that authority also assessed fines against seven other graphite electrode producers under the decision  with fines ranging up to 
euro 
million 
as a result of the assessment of the fine against us  we recorded a pre tax charge of million against results of operations in the second quarter as an additional reserve for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
we are very pleased that this decision brings to a conclusion our last major pending antitrust liability 
from the initiation of its investigation  we have cooperated with the antitrust authority of the european union 
as a result of our cooperation  our fine reflects a substantial reduction from the amount that otherwise would have been assessed 
it is the policy of that authority to negotiate appropriate terms of payment of antitrust fines  including extended payment terms 
we are discussing payment terms with that authority 
after an in depth analysis of the decision  however  in october  we filed an appeal to the court challenging the amount of the fine 
the fine or collateral security therefor would typically be required to be paid or provided at about the time the appeal was filed 
we are currently in discussions with that authority regarding the appropriate form of security during the pendency of the appeal 
if the results of these discussions are not acceptable to us  we may file an interim appeal to the court to waive the requirement for security or to allow us to provide alternative security for payment 
we cannot predict how or when the court would rule on such interim appeal 
we are continuing to cooperate with the us and canadian antitrust authorities in their continuing investigations of other producers and distributors of graphite electrodes 
it is possible that antitrust investigations seeking  among other things  to impose fines and penalties could be initiated against us by authorities in brazil or other jurisdictions 
it is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the us or other jurisdictions 
we have settled  among others  virtually all of the graphite electrode antitrust claims by steel makers in the us and canada as well as antitrust claims by certain other customers 
payment of virtually all of the settlements has been made 
none of the settlement or plea agreements contains restrictions on future prices of our graphite electrodes 
there remain  however  certain pending lawsuits and claims 
through december   we have paid an aggregate of million of fines and net settlement and expense payments and million of imputed interest 
at december   million remained in the reserve 
the balance of the reserve is available for the balance of the fine payable by us to the us department of justice that was imposed in excluding imputed interest thereon  the fine assessed against us by the antitrust authority of the european union in july  the fine assessed against us by the korean antitrust authority in march and other antitrust related matters 
the aggregate amount of remaining committed payments for imputed interest at december  without giving effect to the more favorable restructured payment schedule for the fine payable to the us department of justice established in january was about million 
we cannot assure you that remaining liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims will not materially exceed the remaining uncommitted balance of the reserve or that the timing of payment thereof will not be sooner than anticipated 
in the aggregate including the assessment of the fine by the antitrust authority of the european union and the additional million charge  the fines and settlements described above and related expenses  net  are within the amounts we used to evaluate the million charge 
to the extent that aggregate liabilities and expenses  net  are known or reasonably estimable  million represents our estimate of these liabilities and expenses 
the guilty pleas and the decision by the antitrust authority of the european union make it more difficult to defend against other investigations  lawsuits and claims 
our insurance has not and will not materially cover liabilities that have or may become due in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims 
ucar had been named as a defendant in a stockholder derivative lawsuit and as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit  each of which was based  in part  on the subject matter of the antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
in october  ucar and the other defendants settled these lawsuits for an aggregate of million  of which million was paid by us 
these settlements have become final 
we recorded a charge of million  which included million of unreimbursed expenses  in the third quarter in connection with these settlements 
in the second quarter  we reversed million of this charge because expenses were lower than expected 
customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in our customer base includes both steel makers and non steel makers 
in  three of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non graphite electrode products 
in  five of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two were in the us and one was in each of africa  canada and brazil 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations and the increase or decrease expressed as a percentage of such item in the comparable prior period of such items for the year ended percentage increase december  decrease to to dollars in millions net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  administrative and other expenses other income expense  net n m n m operating profit n m not meaningful the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  administrative and other expenses other income expenses  net

gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit in of million 
gross profit margin in was of net sales as compared to gross profit margin in of of net sales 
the decrease in net sales and gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volume of most of our products  particularly graphite electrodes  which represented about million of the decrease in net sales  primarily due to depressed steel industry conditions 
the increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was less than the percentage decrease in cost of sales  due primarily to lower production levels and benefits from our cost savings activities 
graphite power systems division 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes and lower sales volumes for graphite electrodes and cathodes 
the volume of graphite electrodes sold decreased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the decrease in volume of graphite electrodes sold represented a decrease in net sales of about million 
the decrease was primarily a result of continued lower north american steel production  weaker demand in europe and brazil and actions taken to manage credit risk 
the average sales revenue per metric ton in us dollars and net changes in currency exchange rates of our graphite electrodes was  in as compared to  in the reduced average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates represented a reduction of about million in net sales of graphite electrodes  more than offsetting the benefits of increases in selling prices in local currencies in certain foreign countries 
volume of cathodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to lower volume sold and a lower average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton 
the average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was  in as compared to  in the reduction in average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to facility closures and  to lesser extent  changes in currency exchange rates 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was greater than the percentage decrease in cost of sales 
advanced energy technology division 
net sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to cyclical increases in volume of refractories sold and in sales of products to customers in the aerospace industry  new business sales and an increase in technical service and technology license fees  partially offset by a decrease in volume of flexible graphite sold for gasket applications due to lower demand from the automotive industry as well as a decrease in products sold to the semiconductor and industrial sectors 
cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to the product mix and cost savings activities 
gross profit increased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in gross profit margin was due to the increase in net sales and decrease in cost of sales 
operating profit loss of us as a whole 
operating loss was million in as compared to operating profit of million in operating profit in was impacted by a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets  a million restructuring charge  primarily related to our us and italian graphite electrode operations  a million charge related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  and a million charge related to the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
operating profit in was impacted by a million write off of costs incurred in connection with a proposed initial public offering by graftech that was withdrawn as well as an aggregate of million in special items consisting of a million credit related to securities class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits  a net restructuring charge relating to our advanced graphite materials business  an impairment loss on long lived cathode assets and a corporate restructuring involving a workforce reduction 
selling  administrative and other expense declined million to million in from million in  primarily due to reduced corporate spending 
other income expense  net was million in as compared to nil in we recorded other income expense in both periods resulting from various non operational activities  including gains from currency transactions 
excluding the impact of those special charges  items and costs  operating profit would have been million of net sales in as compared to million of net sales in other items affecting us as a whole 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to lower average annual interest rates and lower average total debt outstanding 
our average outstanding total debt was million in as compared to million in and our average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual interest rates exclude imputed interest on antitrust fines 
provision for income taxes was million for as compared to million for during  the provision for income taxes reflected a effective rate  excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges  the charge related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  and the charge related to the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
for  the provision for income taxes reflected a effective rate 
the increase in the effective rate in was primarily due to a high proportion of income from higher tax jurisdictions 
as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in  a decrease of million from net income of million in compared to net sales were million  a decrease of million  or  from net sales in of million 
gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit in of million 
gross profit margin in was of net sales as compared to gross profit margin in of of net sales 
the decrease in net sales and gross profit was primarily due to lower average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes and the impact of currency exchange rate changes 
the impact of those factors was partially offset by lower costs of sales per metric ton of graphite electrodes and higher volumes of graphite electrodes sold 
the lower average sales revenue per metric ton was due primarily to changes in regional economic conditions  which resulted in a higher percentage of the volume of our graphite electrodes being sold in non north american markets that have lower pricing structures than north american markets  as well as competitive pricing pressures 
the lower cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to higher average annual production levels 
the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was greater than the percentage decrease in costs of sales 
graphite power systems division 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average sales revenue per metric ton of electrodes offset by higher sales volumes for electrodes and cathodes 
the volume of graphite electrodes sold increased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the increase in volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase in net sales of about million 
the average sales revenue per metric ton in us dollars and net changes in currency exchange rates of our graphite electrodes was  in as compared to  in the reduced average sales revenue of graphite electrodes per metric ton represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
this reduction was largely attributable to lower graphite electrode selling prices and  to a lesser extent  changes in product mix 
currency exchange rate changes for electrode and cathode sales  particularly the decline in the euro against the dollar  represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
volume of cathodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in cost of sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volume sold  partially offset by lower average cost of sales per metric ton for graphite electrodes 
the average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was  in as compared to  in the reduction in average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to higher production levels and  to lesser extent  changes in currency exchange rates 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was greater than the percentage decrease in cost of sales 
advanced energy technology division 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales of advanced graphite materials due to the elimination of certain product lines in connection with the restructuring of our advanced graphite materials business and  to a lesser extent  lower prices for advanced graphite materials 
cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to the write down of advanced graphite materials inventory in and the elimination of certain advanced graphite materials product lines 
as a result of the changes described above  gross profit increased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in excluding the million write down of advanced graphite materials inventory in  gross profit margin increased to in from in the increase in gross profit margin was due to the fact that the decline in cost of sales exceeded the decline in net sales 
operating profit of us as a whole 
operating profit was million  or of net sales  in as compared to million  or of net sales  in operating profit in was impacted by a million write off costs incurred in connection with a proposed initial public offering by graftech that was withdrawn as well as an aggregate of million in special items consisting of a net restructuring charge relating to our advanced graphite materials business  an impairment loss on long lived cathode assets and a corporate restructuring involving a workforce reduction 
operating profit in was impacted by a million impairment loss on long lived advanced graphite materials assets  a million charge for the settlement of securities class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits  and a million restructuring credit related to plant closure activities 
excluding these special items  operating profit in was million lower than in due mainly to lower gross profit and lower other income expense  net 
selling  administrative and other expense was relatively stable at million in both and other income expense  net was nil in as compared to income of million in the change was primarily due to the incurrence in of million in consulting fees associated with the power of one initiative  million of legal expenses associated with our lawsuit against our former parents and million in costs associated with the proposed initial public offering by graftech that were not incurred in we recorded income in both periods resulting from various activities  including gains from currency transactions  asset sales and insurance and financial instrument related activities 
other items affecting us as a whole 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease primarily resulted from our refinancing completed in february  which resulted in a decrease in our average annual interest rate 
our average outstanding total debt was million in as compared to million in and our average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual interest rates exclude imputed interest on the antitrust fines 
provision for income taxes was million for as compared to million in during  the provision for income taxes reflected a effective rate  excluding the impact of the write off of costs incurred in connection with the proposed initial public offering by graftech that was withdrawn and the impact of restructuring charges credits and impairment losses 
this is lower than the us federal income tax rate of primarily as a result of tax planning strategies  earnings repatriation plans  tax settlements  re assessment of valuation allowances  and earnings resulting from consolidated entities with lower effective rates 
for  the provision for income taxes reflected a effective rate 
the increase in the effective rate in was primarily due to a high proportion of income from higher tax jurisdictions  which was partially offset by a million reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance on foreign tax credits 
this reduction was based on a re assessment in of our us tax profile and associated tax planning strategies 
as a result of the changes described above  net income was million in  a decrease of million from net income of million in effects of inflation in general  our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the inflation in each country in which we have a manufacturing facility 
during through the first half  the effects of inflation on our cost of sales in the us and foreign countries except for highly inflationary countries have been generally mitigated by a combination of improved operating efficiency and permanent on going cost savings 
accordingly  during that period  these effects were not material to us 
from mid through mid  we experienced higher energy and raw material costs primarily due to the substantial increase in the worldwide market price of oil and natural gas 
during the latter part of that period  we were able to similarly mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales 
we have not experienced significant inflation since mid we cannot assure that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  by which we may be able to increase prices for our products 
we account for our non us subsidiaries under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  their assets and liabilities are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we maintain operations in brazil  russia and mexico  countries which have had in the past  and may have now or in the future  highly inflationary economies  defined as cumulative inflation of about or more over a three calendar year period 
in general  the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies have been remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations rather than as part of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in light of significant increases in inflation in mexico  effective january   mexico was considered to have a highly inflationary economy 
accordingly  translation gains and losses for our mexican operations were included in the consolidated statements of operations for in  we began to account for our mexican subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency  irrespective of mexico s inflationary status  because its sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
we have always considered russia to have a highly inflationary economy 
accordingly  translation gains and losses for our russian operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations in  and prior to august   our swiss subsidiary used the dollar as its functional currency 
beginning august   our swiss subsidiary began using the euro as its functional currency because its operations became predominantly euro denominated 
foreign currency translation adjustments decreasing stockholders equity amounted to million  including million associated with our brazilian subsidiary  in  million  including million associated with our south african subsidiary  in and million  including million associated with our south african subsidiary  in effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur manufacturing costs and sell our products in multiple currencies 
as a result  in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates as well as by inflation in countries with highly inflationary economies where we have manufacturing facilities 
to manage certain exposures to risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various off balance sheet financial instruments 
to account for translation of foreign currencies into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes  we record foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as part of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets  except in the case of operations in highly inflationary economies or which use the dollar as their functional currency where we record foreign currency translation gains and losses as part of other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
when the local currencies of foreign countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by us  which is priced in dollars 
we price products manufactured at our facilities for sale in local and certain export markets in local currencies 
accordingly  when the local currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
over the past three years  many of the foreign countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  particularly brazil  have been subject to significant economic pressures  which have impacted inflation and currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
as a result  many of the currencies in which we manufacture and sell our products weakened against the dollar 
during  the brazilian real substantially devalued 
during  the south african rand declined about  the euro declined about and the brazilian real declined about 
during  the euro declined about  the brazilian real declined about and the south african rand declined about 
the net impact of currency changes included in other income expense  net was a gain of million in  a gain of million in and a gain of million in in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact was a reduction of million in excluding million in due to the lowering of prices by our brazilian subsidiary because of competitive cost advantages resulting from the decline in the brazilian real  a reduction of million in and a reduction of million in we sought to mitigate these adverse impacts on net sales by increasing local currency prices for some of our products in various regions as circumstances permitted 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have positive or negative impacts on our net sales or cost of sales 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to mitigate any adverse effects of such changes 
to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various financial instruments 
the amount of currency exchange contracts used by us to minimize these risks was million at december  and million at december  total outstanding dollar denominated debt of our foreign subsidiaries excluding our russian and mexican subsidiaries and  since december   our swiss subsidiary  which used the dollar as their functional currency was nil at december  and changes in the currency exchange rates between the dollar and the currencies in the countries in which these excluded subsidiaries are located result in foreign currency gains and losses that are reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
our foreign subsidiaries with dollar denominated debt have entered into currency exchange contracts to protect against changes in currency exchange rates 
the amount of such contracts was million at december  and nil at december  we believe that such contracts reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates related to such borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations  debt financing and  since july  net proceeds from our public offering of common stock 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of debt reduction  capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with investigations  lawsuits and claims and payment of restructuring costs 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
we had total debt of million and a stockholders deficit of million at december  as compared to total debt of million and a stockholders deficit of million at december  at december   a substantial portion of our debt has variable interest rates 
in addition  if we are required to pay or issue a letter of credit to secure payment of the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union pending resolution of our appeal regarding the amount of the fine  the payment would be financed by borrowing under or secured by a letter of credit that would constitute a borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
our leverage and obligations  as well as changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions and other factors  have adversely impacted our recent operating results 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  net debt which is total debt  net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was million at december  as compared to million at december  debt reduction 
as a result of our high leverage and substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions and other factors  we have placed high priority on efforts to manage cash and reduce debt 
during  we were able to generate million of positive cash flow from working capital 
as a result  during  we reduced our net debt by more than million while  at the same time  paying million of antitrust fines and net settlement and expense payments and restructuring payments 
during  we were able to maintain a relatively stable net debt level excluding the net proceeds from our equity offering in july while  at the same time  paying million in restructuring payments and antitrust fines and net settlement and expense payments 
cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
for at least the past five years  we have had positive annual cash flow from operations  excluding payments in connection with restructurings and investigations  lawsuits and claims 
typically  the first quarter of each year results in neutral or negative cash flow from operations after deducting cash used for capital expenditures and excluding payments in connection with restructurings and investigations  lawsuits and claims and payment of interest on our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes which have since been redeemed due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  customer buy ins in advance of annual price increases  working capital requirements and payment of variable compensation with respect to the immediately preceding year 
typically  the other three quarters result in significant positive cash flow from operations after deducting cash used for capital expenditures 
the third quarter tends to produce relatively less positive cash flow primarily as a result of scheduled plant shutdowns by our customers for vacations 
following a recovery in the steel and other metals and transportation industries  we believe that cash flow trends would follow this historical pattern 
we use  and are dependent on  funds available under our revolving credit facility  including continued compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities  as well as monthly or quarterly cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that our cost savings will  over the next one to two years  continue to improve our cash flow from operations for a given level of net sales 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these initiatives are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs  while they are being implemented 
our high leverage and substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and these obligations  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our leverage and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns or in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
our ability to service our debt as it comes due is dependent on our future financial and operating performance 
our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants under the senior facilities is also dependent on our future financial and operating performance 
this performance  in turn is subject to various factors  including certain factors beyond our control  such as changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  developments in antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims involving us and inflation in raw material  energy and other costs 
we cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to meet our debt service and other obligations when due 
even if we are able to meet our debt service and other obligations when due  we may not be able to comply with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
the breach of any of the covenants under the senior facilities  unless waived by the lenders  would be a default under the senior facilities 
this would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the senior facilities 
it would also permit the lenders to terminate their commitments to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
this would have an immediate material adverse effect on our liquidity 
an acceleration of maturity of the senior facilities or a breach of the covenants contained in the senior notes would permit the holders of the senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the senior notes 
acceleration of maturity of the senior notes would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the senior facilities and terminate their commitments to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders or holders  the lenders and holders could proceed against the collateral securing the senior facilities and the senior notes  respectively  and exercise all other rights available to them 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders or the holders  or otherwise obtain a waiver from the lenders or the holders  we could be required to limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  certain of our business plans  activities or operations  reduce or delay certain capital expenditures  sell certain of our assets or businesses  restructure or refinance some or all of our debt or incur additional debt  or sell additional common stock or other securities 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any such waiver or take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
as described above  we are dependent on our revolving credit facility and continuing compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities for liquidity 
the senior facilities require us to  among other things  comply with specified minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios that become more restrictive over time 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with such covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
while our revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to 
euro 
million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december   our ability to borrow under this facility may effectively be substantially less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the senior facilities 
at march   we had full availability under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  payment of the fine or issuance of a letter of credit to secure payment of the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union would significantly reduce remaining funds available under our revolving credit facility for operating and other purposes 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of our business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although we cannot assure you that such will be the case  we believe that  based on our expected cash flow from operations  our expected resolution of our remaining obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  and existing capital resources  and taking into account our efforts to reduce costs and working capital needs  improve efficiencies and product quality  generate growth and earnings and maximize funds available to meet our debt service and other obligations  we will be able to manage our working capital and cash flow to permit us to service our debt and meet our obligations when due 
description of senior facilities 
in february  we completed a debt recapitalization and obtained the senior facilities 
in the third quarter  pursuant to our debt recapitalization in february  our italian subsidiary entered into a 
euro 
million about million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at september long term debt arrangement with a third party lender 
we also placed on deposit with the third party lender funds in the same amount  which secure the debt 
since we had the legal right to set off  and the intent to do so  such amounts have been netted and are not reflected separately in the consolidated balance sheets 
in february  in connection with the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  we exercised our right of set off and retired the debt 
in october  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  increase the maximum leverage ratio permitted thereunder through june  in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million and the margin which is added to either euro libor or the alternate base rate in order to determine the interest rate payable thereunder by basis points 
in april  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  exclude certain expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit initiated by us against our former parents up to a maximum of million  but not more than million in any quarter and certain charges and payments in connection with antitrust fines  settlements and expenses from the calculation of financial covenants 
charges over and above million charge recorded in recorded on or before june  for antitrust fines  settlements and expenses are excluded from the calculation of financial covenants until paid up to a maximum of million reduced by the amount of certain debt  other than the senior notes  incurred by us that is not incurred under the senior facilities  million of which debt was outstanding at december  
the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union  as well as the additional million charge recorded in july and any payments related to such fine including payments within the million charge recorded in  are excluded from the calculation of financial covenants through june  in july  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  change our financial covenants so that they were less restrictive through than would otherwise have been the case 
in connection therewith  we have agreed that our investments in graftech and any of our other unrestricted subsidiaries after this amendment will be made in the form of secured loans  which will be pledged to secure the senior facilities  and the maximum amount of capital expenditures permitted under the senior facilities would be reduced in and we do not expect that our capital expenditures would exceed such maximums 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million and the margin which is added to either euro libor or the alternate base rate in order to determine the interest rate payable thereunder increased by basis points 
in december  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million 
in february  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit us to issue senior notes in an amount not to exceed million  to pledge certain unsecured intercompany term notes and unsecured guarantees of those notes to secure such senior notes  to have certain us subsidiaries holding a majority of our us assets guarantee such senior notes and to have those us subsidiaries pledge shares of graftech to secure such guarantees 
furthermore  the amendment permitted the net proceeds from the sale of such senior notes to be applied as described elsewhere in this report 
in connection with this amendment  our maximum permitted leverage ratio was substantially increased and our minimum required interest coverage ratio was substantially decreased while maintaining full availability of our revolving credit facility 
the amendment also changed the manner in which net debt and ebitda are calculated to exclude certain fees  costs and expenses including fees of counsel and experts in connection with the lawsuit initiated by us against our former parents as well as any letter of credit issued to secure payment of the antitrust fine assessed against us by the antitrust authority of the european union 
in addition  the amendment expanded our ability to make certain investments  including investments in graftech  and eliminate provisions relating to a spin off of graftech 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million and the margin which is added to either euro libor or the alternate base rate in order to determine the interest rate payable thereunder increased by basis points 
the senior facilities  as amended  consist of o a tranche a facility providing for initial term loans of million and of 
euro 
million equivalent to million based on currency exchange rates in effect at february  to ucar finance 
the tranche a facility amortizes in quarterly installments over six years  commencing june   with quarterly installments ranging from about million in to about million in  with the final installment payable on december  in october  we converted million from dollar denominated to euro denominated debt 
o a tranche b facility providing for initial term loans of million to ucar finance 
the tranche b facility amortizes over eight years  commencing june   with nominal quarterly installments during the first six years  and quarterly installments of about million in and  with the final installment payable on december  o a revolving facility providing for revolving and swingline loans to  and the issuance of dollar denominated letters of credit for the account of  ucar finance and certain of our other subsidiaries in an aggregate principal and stated amount at any time not to exceed 
euro 
million 
the revolving facility terminates on february  as a condition to each borrowing under the revolving facility  we are required to represent  among other things  that the aggregate amount of payments made excluding certain imputed interest and additional reserves created in connection with antitrust  securities and stockholder derivative investigations  lawsuits and claims do not exceed million by more than million which million is reduced by the amount of certain debt  other than the senior notes  incurred by us that is not incurred under the senior facilities 
after completion of our public offering of common stock in july  our private offering of senior notes in february and the initial application of the net proceeds therefrom  the aggregate principal payments due on the tranche a and tranche b term loans are no payments in  or  million in  million in and million in we are generally required to make mandatory prepayments in the amount of o either or depending on our leverage ratio  which is the ratio of our adjusted net debt to our adjusted total ebitda of adjusted excess cash flow 
the obligation to make these prepayments  if any  arises after the end of each year with respect to adjusted excess cash flow during the prior year 
o of the net proceeds of certain asset sales or incurrence of certain indebtedness 
o of the net proceeds of the issuance of any ucar equity securities  in the case of the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in july 
we may make voluntary prepayments under the senior facilities 
there is no penalty or premium due in connection with prepayments whether voluntary or mandatory 
ucar finance makes secured and guaranteed intercompany loans of the net proceeds of borrowings under the senior facilities to ucar global s subsidiaries 
the obligations of ucar finance under the senior facilities are secured  with certain exceptions  by first priority security interests in all of these intercompany loans including the related security interests and guarantees

inventory levels increased in our graphite power systems division primarily due to transitioning activities in connection with the shutdown of our us graphite electrode manufacturing operations and lower than expected volume of graphite electrodes sold 
accounts payable increased primarily due to our cash management activities  partially offset by lower spending  including lower purchases of petroleum coke as excess inventories stockpiled following the explosion at one of conoco s petroleum coke plants were reduced and production levels were reduced as demand for graphite electrodes and certain other products weakened during cash flow provided by operations was million in as compared to cash flow provided by operations of million in this improvement of million resulted primarily from a lower use of cash flow for working capital of approximately million  partially offset by lower net income including non cash items

critical accounting policies the sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following accounting policies could be deemed to be critical by the sec 
use of estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges  tax valuation allowances and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated value  our assets may be overstated 
inventories 
we record the value of inventory at the lower of cost or market  and periodically review the book value of products and product lines to determine if they are properly valued 
we also periodically review the composition of our inventories and seek to identify slow moving inventories 
in connection with those reviews  we seek to identify products that may not be properly valued and assess the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if a write down to current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  sometimes called the ceiling defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin  sometimes called the floor 
generally  we do not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if the actual value is significantly less than the recorded value  our assets may be overstated 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and other intangible assets not being amortized pursuant to sfas no 
 and certain other assets 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the statement effective january  we anticipate that the statement will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
 which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
sfas no 
will be effective for all financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we anticipate that the statement will not  upon adoption  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  both of which are effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
we will adopt these statements effective january  we anticipate that the statements will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations except that we will no longer amortize goodwill 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of sfas no 
 which has the same title 
sfas no 
provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings  and requires certain additional disclosures 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march   and is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
assessment of the euro on january   eleven of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies called legacy currencies and one common currency called the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  the legacy currencies are being withdrawn from circulation 
our subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
we believe that  under current conditions  the conversion of legacy currencies into the euro will not have a materially adverse affect on us 
costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in millions expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposure to these changes  we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures 
we do not use derivatives for trading purposes or to generate income  and we do not use leveraged derivatives 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
we enter into agreements with financial institutions  which are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to the incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
during  we purchased interest rate caps on up to million of debt  limiting the floating interest rate factor on this debt to a weighted average rate of for the period commencing june and continuing through june at december   we had outstanding interest rate caps of million and 
euro 
million limiting our floating interest rate factor on related debt to a weighted average rate of where the interest on the debt is based on libor and where the interest on the debt is based on euro libor through various dates ending june fees related to these agreements are charged to interest expense over the term of the agreements 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from o investments in our foreign subsidiaries and in our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  which are denominated in local currencies  o raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency  and o export sales made by our subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency 
when we deem it appropriate  we may attempt to limit our risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates through both operational and financial market activities 
financial instruments are used to attempt to hedge existing exposures  firm commitments and  potentially  anticipated transactions 
we use forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
we held contracts against these risks with an aggregate notional amount of about million at december  and million at december  all of our contracts mature within one year 
all of our contracts are marked to market monthly 
unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency contracts were nil at december  and we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates on reported earnings at december  based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all maturities would have increased our interest expense for by about million
