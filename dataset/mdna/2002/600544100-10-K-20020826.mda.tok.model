item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis you should read the issues discussed in management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s form k 
overview the past year presented the worst business environment the contract furniture industry has experienced in decades  perhaps since the early s 
the marketplace became extraordinarily competitive  with many players fighting to remain profitable 
over the year we made tough decisions that we believe have served to strengthen our business model going forward 
our company held to its strategy  integrity  and overall operational excellence 
we have  and continue to  become a leaner and stronger organization positioned to deliver stronger returns in the future 
business attitudes related to investments in capital expansion and improvements changed radically as the economy fell into a state of uncertainty 
timing of current and potential customer projects remained volatile and difficult to predict 
customer interest remained healthy  but some major projects were deferred or put on hold indefinitely 
we are seeing signs of recovery  but timing will be the main issue 
we put a considerable amount of effort into re aligning our cost structures and increasing their variable nature 
we believe that this will improve the economics of the company  regardless of short term business levels 
steady cash generation  disciplined capital expenditures  and increased returns on invested capital remain at the forefront of our decisions 
we feel that the key to future success lies in focusing our efforts on revenue growth  which we seek to achieve by new product developments that meet customers more traditional and immediate needs  and the expansion of our markets through innovative changes to workplace environments 
continued investment in innovation  brand equity  and our distribution channels will strengthen the core factors that improve our ability to compete  regardless of the size of our industry 
in fact  our spending on research and development has remained consistent with recent levels and significantly increased as a percentage of revenue 
business model re alignment actions significant changes were necessary to withstand the abrupt decline in revenues and the unpredictable timing of an industry turnaround 
our ability to produce positive cash flow and remain profitable at lower short term sales levels became critical 
lowering our breakeven point was another goal to withstand market volatility 
more importantly  our ability to serve our existing and new customers with the highest degree of reliability is a competitive strength that must be maintained 
we made difficult decisions that significantly impacted the entire company  both economically and emotionally 
the following objectives were identified before we took action 
ensure none of the actions negatively impact our ability to serve customers or implement our long term strategy 
simplify the business for both short and long term agility 
ensure all actions provide a sustainable long term economic benefit 
balance operating cash flows with the need for business reinvestment 
maintain the overall corporate selling capacity 
ensure changes honor our corporate values and are handled with integrity 
our restructuring actions addressed fixed costs 
the actions involved adjustments to both overhead costs impacting gross margin and operating expense levels 
the items outlined below only relate to action plans covered under the special charges 
we continued to scale back costs in all areas and simplify certain business operations to improve short term results  limit capital expenditures  and focus on balancing cash flows with investment opportunities 
below is a summary of the actions taken to reduce our costs and increase the variability of our business model 
the major restructuring activities are now complete and position us for significant benefits as revenues grow 
a reduction in our work force  including permanent and temporary employees  totaled  people over percent since january over million square feet or percent of manufacturing  warehouse  and office space will be eliminated 
we made these adjustments without compromising capacity needs for substantial revenue growth 
acceleration of our lean manufacturing initiatives and system implementations are the main drivers that enabled this quick reduction 
the outsourcing of our national transportation fleet  some of our paint processes  and in sourcing of several processes related to panel manufacturing 
this improved our capacity utilization and reduced fixed costs in several areas 
consolidation of our channels to market to build on the strong herman miller brand and image 
this included the phase out of the distinct sqa brand and the discontinuation of herman miller red 
we continue to serve the same customers with the same goals of reliable and predictable products and services  even though our channels to market have been consolidated under one brand 
adjustments to our international business operations  which included exiting our owned distribution in select foreign markets where we are not currently a market leader 
costs should track more closely with the revenue generated and potential opportunities within these regions 
we incurred special charges related to our restructuring actions totaling million before taxes for the year 
we estimate that million to million of pretax special charges that cannot be accrued will occur during the first half of next fiscal year 
benefits related to these actions are estimated to total between million and million on an annualized basis 
although some of the benefits began to appear during the second half of this year  the full impact should be realized next year and  more importantly  as revenues increase 
cash outlays related to these actions are estimated to be in the range of million to million 
the cash impact does not include expected proceeds from the sale of facilities totaling million 
part of this amount includes our facility located in west michigan previously used for powder coating  which sold for approximately million in july of although interest in our other properties remains strong  we have no binding commitments for the sale of these assets and the timing of proceeds remains uncertain 
the special charges fall into five major categories 
these groupings with the respective charge are shown in the table below 
further discussion and information related to the charges and remaining accruals can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in millions severance  retirement enhancements  and outplacement pension effect of workforce reductions lease and supplier contract cancellation facility exit costs asset impairment total financial results consolidated net sales in fiscal  our sales contracted as capital spending and corporate facility and employment levels declined throughout the world 
lower sales volumes across all geographic areas and product lines resulted in revenues of  million  a percent decline from fiscal the year began with a fairly strong backlog of orders but quickly diminished 
new orders did not replenish at a pace equal to shipments 
customers delayed projects  producing highly inconsistent and unpredictable order patterns 
adding to the timing delays  competitive activity heightened as industry levels declined 
domestic operations our domestic sales this year totaled  million  a decline of million or percent from the prior year 
in fiscal sales increased percent after growing percent in in fiscal  we acquired geiger  a wood case goods manufacturer  to complement our product offerings 
geiger sales accounted for to percent of the total domestic sales during the past three fiscal years 
discounting became more severe during the year 
from a pricing strategy standpoint  we continued to manage away from deep discounting by focusing on product differentiation and other incentives 
unfortunately  as weak economic conditions persisted  prospective customers focused heavily on price 
we responded when necessary  giving incremental discounts that reduced revenues by approximately million domestically 
to put this in perspective  discounts reduced net sales in by million and million in competitive pricing will most likely continue to place pressure on margins in the near term 
the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma reported that us sales declined approximately percent in the months ended may  after increasing percent in and percent in according to bifma  the decline in contract furniture shipments was the worst in the last years 
we believe demand for office furniture in the us is most closely correlated to three primary factors in the macro economy corporate profits  service sector employment  and nonresidential fixed investments 
at the end of may  bifma estimated that industry shipments will decline percent in calendar  but the anticipated turnaround will produce percent growth in calendar considering the quarterly forecasts that correspond to our fiscal quarters  bifma projects industry shipments will increase percent during our fiscal given the state of the economy and low corporate confidence levels  this forecast may be overly optimistic 
international operations and exports from the united states furniture demand contracted throughout most of our international markets 
for the fiscal year  international sales levels decreased percent or million and totaled million 
international revenue accounted for percent of consolidated sales  similar to the past several years 
included in the business model realignments previously discussed were certain actions aimed at affecting our international operation cost structures and market opportunities 
the overriding goals of business simplification and increased cost variability were key to the decisions 
the objectives were accomplished in three ways 
first  we improved the utilization of our domestic infrastructure and customer service capabilities to support the export business  allowing us to decrease overhead previously dedicated to the international business 
second  the depth and strength of the leadership team throughout the world has improved dramatically in the past three years 
as a result  we eliminated certain positions and now rely on fewer people  reducing overall compensation costs 
third  we strengthened the distribution channels and increased the use of dealer relationships  lowering our fixed direct selling costs 
full support  owned business operations were exited in asia  south america  and europe 
we believe growth exists in these markets  but our cost structure should more closely mirror revenue generation 
international operations posted a loss of million for  versus income of million last year and million in excluding charges related to the restructure actions  the loss in totaled million 
gross margin gross margin  as a percent of net sales  for was percent compared to percent for the past two years 
the margin decline was primarily driven by under absorbed overhead costs from the rapid volume declines  combined with increased discounting 
we managed our direct product costs  such as material and labor  very effectively as volume declined 
as a percentage of revenue  direct costs were equal to last year as we were able to sustain the improvements we achieved in we reduced our production overhead costs  both fixed and variable  by over percent from levels 
we lowered costs in almost all categories of spending 
our manufacturing teams achieved significant overhead savings  reduced material costs  and held labor rates steady 
in addition  the task of consolidating several of our facilities was accomplished ahead of schedule without any significant shipment delays  displaying the excellence and dedication of the people within our organization 
despite these remarkable achievements  the effect of volume declines could not be totally offset by our actions taken this year 
we employ variable compensation incentive plans tied to reaching eva improvement targets 
as a result of the unprecedented declines in volumes  eva targets were not hit and incentives were not paid 
this reduced the overhead costs  affecting gross margin by million compared to offsetting the majority of this reduction was higher depreciation related to production assets 
as facility consolidation plans are fully completed and as we begin to see the effects of limiting capital expenditures  depreciation expense will be reduced 
additionally  as revenues grow and profits increase on a lower capital base  our eva should improve  reestablishing some level of variable compensation 
as previously mentioned  incremental discounting eroded margins by million this year 
however  we offset the impact of increased competitive pricing through material price and usage savings 
we continued to develop programs that extend our efficient manufacturing techniques to our suppliers 
this activity consistently produces stronger relationships and lower costs for all parties involved 
our purchasing  manufacturing  and product development teams partnered with key suppliers to produce roughly million of incremental price and usage savings  more than offsetting the incremental discounting 
however  the overall economic pressures of the past year have added more risk to some suppliers financial strength 
in some cases  material sources have been changed to improve our ability to maintain supplier reliability 
overall  we have not experienced any significant difficulty in maintaining sourcing requirements at current or reduced prices  nor do we expect to 
current tariffs on steel imports are expected to have some adverse impact  but overall should not materially affect our margins going forward 
we are aggressively pursuing activities to offset the potential impact of increased steel prices 
investments in improved production capabilities over the past two years have shown positive effects on our margin 
ongoing implementation of the herman miller production system  which promotes efficiency techniques  directly added to these improvements 
many of the rapid and reliable processes employed by our greenhouse facility focused on the sqa discipline were incorporated into other areas of the company 
improvements in lean manufacturing allowed us to accelerate plans to reduce overhead costs 
restructure actions relied heavily on the ability to fully employ these techniques  effectively maintaining capacity while reducing facilities and floor space 
by reducing facilities and increasing efficiencies  we have started to re balance our fixed versus variable cost structure 
of course  volume will remain the key driver of margin improvements operating expenses for the year  operating expenses totaled million  including million of special charges related to our restructure plan 
excluding the special charges  operating expenses were million in  an million or percent decrease from in addition to the special charges  we accelerated the depreciation on certain sales technology assets that were replaced at the end of this acceleration increased operating expenses by million 
without this added expense and the special charges  our operating expenses decreased by percent from last year 
our restructuring actions occurred throughout the year and were a major driver in decreasing costs 
the annualized impact from our actions was not fully realized in reduced costs also resulted from the reduction in variable compensation tied to eva improvement targets 
incentive payments did not occur this year  lowering operating expenses by million compared to offsetting these reductions during the year was a million pretax legal judgment related to a lawsuit filed against one of our wholly owned dealers 
this matter is currently on appeal and we have fully reserved the amount of the judgment 
the reduction in volume placed significant pressure on the level of operating expenses we could support 
we made tough decisions to prioritize our spending 
as stated above  our key decisions focused on balancing operating cash flows with business re investment 
maintaining our customer service levels and selling capacity while continuing to execute long term strategies took priority 
we challenged past initiatives and made several decisions to prioritize and simplify our approach to the market 
we eliminated the red initiative and sqa brand  focusing our investments on the herman miller brand 
our facility consolidations  completion of certain technology initiatives  and administrative cost reductions produced savings that can be used to continue product and workplace environment developments 
we continued to make investments to strengthen our distribution channels  selling capacity  and relationships with the architectural and design community 
herman miller built its place in the market through innovation 
we have and will continue to build on this tradition 
our history holds numerous examples of improvements to the workplace through extensive research that led to revolutionary product designs and workplace environment changes 
research and design costs  excluding royalty payments  were million in  compared to million in  and million in royalty payments made to designers of the company s products as the products are sold are not included in research and development costs  since they are considered to be a variable cost of the product 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs were percent in  percent in  and percent in as discussed earlier  new product design and development has been  and continues to be  a key business strategy 
we have prioritized certain initiatives but believe that continuing to invest in development is critical to strengthening our competitive position  growing our share in traditional markets  and expanding into related markets 
we continued to make targeted investments to further strengthen our products and services 
new innovations and market opportunities are in development 
the short term challenges of today s economy have focused our efforts but have not changed the overall mission of creating great places to work 
we will continue to protect and maximize the investments of our stakeholders 
we believe the path we are now taking will lead to significant gains as the economy improves 
operating income operating income in was a loss of million 
this included million of special charges related to our restructure plans 
excluding these charges  our operating income for was positive  totaling million 
comparatively  operating income in was million and million in obviously the abrupt reduction in revenues could not be offset in the short term  resulting in the significant decrease 
other expenses and income other expense was million in fiscal  while in we incurred other expense of million 
the rise is primarily attributable to higher interest expense due to higher debt levels and lower income on interest bearing investments  offset in part by gains related to the sale of certain dealerships 
to fund future investments  attain capital structure objectives  and provide for financial flexibility  interest bearing debt increased through the issuance of a long term public debt offering executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal an expanded explanation of our improved debt structure appears in the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
interest expense increased to million  as compared to million last year 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
the change in tax rate was primarily the result of our pretax loss position  permanent deferred tax items  and the impact of state income taxes 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent due to international tax planning strategies and lower state taxes 
during fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs primarily related to the disallowance of deductions for corporate owned life insurance coli policy loan interest and administrative fees for all years of the insurance programs since their inception in fiscal the irs has been pursuing an adverse position regarding similar coli programs in a considerable number of corporations 
the irs position has been supported by judicial rulings in a limited number of court proceedings unrelated to our company  with no favorable decisions to the taxpayers 
tax expenses will not be affected  since we had previously reserved for this contingency 
the settlement with the irs provided for the surrender of our coli program life insurance policies  thereby eliminating any material future tax exposure 
net earnings net earnings for the year were a loss of million or 
per share compared to a profit of million or per share in fiscal excluding the special charges taken this year  earnings totaled a loss of million or 
per share 
liquidity and capital resources the table below shows certain key cash flow and capital highlights in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments cash from operating activities capital expenditures interest bearing debt debt to ebitda ratio exc 
special charges ebitda to interest expense ratio exc 
special charges stock repurchased or retired the unprecedented decline in our industry and general economic uncertainty has focused our efforts on maintaining a strong cash position 
our operations continued to generate positive cash flows even after funding million related to pension plan contributions and cash charges associated with the restructuring activities 
we continued to generate and conserve cash to solidify our financial position 
during  we significantly reduced capital expenditures to levels below operating cash generation 
although we are not abandoning our repurchase strategy  we significantly curtailed our repurchases in the middle of the second quarter to provide financial flexibility 
our cash and short term investments ended the year at million  a million decline from during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed an initial public debt offering  raising million through year notes with a percent coupon rate 
the proceeds from the debt offering were used primarily to repay borrowings on a million revolving credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year  we renegotiated debt covenants with our banks and private placement note holders 
the covenant formulas were amended to exclude the special charges related to restructuring actions incurred during the year 
our available credit  combined with our existing cash and expected cash flow  is adequate to fund our day to day operations  strategic investments  debt commitments  and share repurchases 
debt to ebitda and ebitda to interest expense ratios changed significantly during fiscal ebitda stands for earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
ebitda calculations shown above exclude the effect of special charges related to our fiscal restructuring activity 
during fiscal we incurred special charges of million 
if special charges were included in ebitda for  debt to ebitda ratio was and ebitda to interest expense ratio was at the end of fiscal  interest bearing debt was million  a decrease of million from may cash flow results our cash flow from operations totaled million in comparatively  cash flow from operations was million in and in reduced volume and related lower earnings were the major factors behind the decline 
cash flow from operations this year was also reduced by pension contributions of million and million of cash payments related to our restructure actions 
excluding the pension contribution and cash impact of restructuring  cash flow from operations was million  a percent decrease from we significantly reduced our capital expenditures in each quarter we lowered capital investments as revenue levels declined 
capital expenditures totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
major changes in investments from prior periods include a re pacing of information technology enhancements and fewer facility expansions previously needed during high growth periods 
investments in new product developments and customer related selling platforms were consistent with prior periods 
our restructuring efforts and business model simplification focuses our investments toward future growth initiatives and market expansions  while balancing our cash with the current business environment 
we expect capital expenditures to be between million and million in fiscal the largest planned expenditures will be for expanded customer development channel enhancements  manufacturing improvements  and new product tooling 
during the past year  we sold two dealerships in the united states  one dealership in the asian market  and one dealership in south america 
these actions are consistent with our intent to increase the variability of our cost structure in certain markets by selling owned dealers to independent owners 
we may acquire dealerships from time to time in the future to maintain the strength of our distribution network or facilitate the orderly transition of our dealers to new owners 
we established two alliances in  adding to the two alliances developed in  to capitalize on our distribution channels  complement our product offerings  and increase profits 
during we increased our owned dealer network through one acquisition 
in  we acquired geiger  a manufacturer of wood casegood products  this acquisition included sales offices in the united kingdom and canada 
we also acquired a privately owned north american dealer as part of our service strategy 
we will continue to investigate acquisitions and alliances to fill strategically identified gaps in our product offering and service capabilities 
common stock transactions in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired   cost of shares acquired weighted average cost per share acquired shares issued   weighted average price per share issued cash dividends dividends per share 

in fiscal  repurchases of common stock totaled 
million shares for million compared to million shares for million in and million shares for million in management and the board of directors believe the share repurchase program is an excellent  tax efficient means of returning value to our shareholders and preventing dilution from employee ownership programs and shares issued in acquisitions 
in july  our board authorized a new million share repurchase plan  bringing the remaining amount authorized for repurchase to million  as of june  we use various stock option plans as an incentive to align executive performance with shareholder interests 
further information related to stock option plans can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
key measurement at herman miller  we use economic value added eva to determine whether we are creating value for our employee owners and shareholders 
we evaluate all our business decisions in this manner to ensure we are investing resources in opportunities that create the highest long term return 
we also use eva as the basis for calculating our incentive compensation 
making eva such an important part of our overall compensation structure has driven a higher level of business literacy and decision making capabilities throughout our work force 
even though cost containment programs were implemented during the year  we were unable to offset the magnitude and pace of order declines  resulting in lower eva for the full fiscal year 
our compensation programs were tied to achieving eva growth targets 
because the decline in business was so abrupt  we made no variable compensation payments 
we continue to believe that eva is the best method of rewarding our employees in a manner consistent with the rewards we provide to our shareholders  and market research validates this perspective 
our belief in the future potential of our strategic initiatives continues to drive us toward investments that create long term value  even if eva results suffer in the short run 
we have presented a summarized calculation of our eva for fiscal   and calculation of economic value added in millions operating income interest expense on noncapitalized leases goodwill amortization special charges other increase decrease in reserves change in capitalized design and research

design and research expense is capitalized and amor tized over five years 
management s estimate of the weighted average of the minimum equity and d ebt returns required by the providers of capital 
reevaluated every year and adjusted when necess ary to reflect the current rate environment and capital structure 
we generated a negative million of eva this year 
comparatively  eva totaled a positive million last year and million in lower earnings on reduced volumes drove the majority of the decrease 
our average capital base increased by million  driven by higher levels of cash held for financial flexibility and capitalized charges related to restructuring actions 
this increase was partially offset by lower working capital requirements  notes receivable  and coli related assets 
our pension contribution resulted in a substantial positive effect on cash taxes in net operating profit after taxes declined substantially and ended the year at million 
contingencies the company  for a number of years  has sold various products to the united states government under general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
the gsa is permitted to audit the company s compliance with the gsa contracts 
at any point in time  a number of gsa audits are either scheduled or in progress 
management does not expect resolution of the audits to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
we are not aware of any other litigation or threatened litigation that would have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
conclusion the economic recession and resulting industry contraction led to a revenue decline of over million this year 
this required significant adjustments to our business model and cost structure to strengthen the company and protect the interests of its stakeholders 
the eroding business conditions also called for decisive action and rapid implementation of changes 
many of the choices we made were difficult 
these actions were taken with care and in a manner consistent with herman miller s reputation for integrity and ethical business practice 
we want to assure our investors that when we conduct business  integrity and ethical behavior are not an option but a requirement in both our strategic business decision making and our financial reporting 
while business ethics have come under intense scrutiny in the past year  they have been an integral part of our corporate culture since our founding and will continue to guide our actions in the future 
looking back  fiscal demonstrated our organization s resilience and the power of our business model to withstand a dramatic decline in volume 
we believe the company s financial strength and flexibility will enhance our ability to compete effectively 
while fiscal held many challenges  herman miller will continue to lead in design focused innovation  expanding our market opportunity and establishing new reference points for the industry 
basis of presentation when considering year over year growth statistics  it is important to note that herman miller s fiscal year and contained weeks  compared to weeks in fiscal critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivables 
in addition to known or judgmental components of our allowances  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivables 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
in some situations  issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct or replace problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified  and the amount of such reserves are based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories of certain subsidiaries are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required may be adjusted as conditions change 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we provide reserves for health  worker s compensation  long term disability  and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on actuarially determined expected future claims 
the methods and variable component used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claim experience can vary 
we maintain certain insurance coverage for risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
some of the assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and expected rate of increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based on internal and external factors 
adjustments to the assumptions could result in changes to the future expense and liabilities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we will be adopting statement no 
and no 
in the first quarter of fiscal based on preliminary impairment testing for goodwill  we do not believe that the adoption of these standards will result in any impairment charges related to our goodwill assets 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
after applying the provisions of the statements  our pretax income is expected to increase by approximately million in fiscal in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes previous statements issued 
we will adopt this statement during the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe this adoption will have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this discussion and other sections of our summary annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  current expectations  estimates  and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy  and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecasts  likely  plans  projects  should  variations of such words  and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  extent  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc  undertakes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the company s international operations did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company during fiscal or because the company conducts business internationally  however  it will continue to be subject to related currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company maintains fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on may   to convert million of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instrument is held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
it is not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparty to this swap instrument is a large major financial institution which the company believes is of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by this counterparty  such losses are not anticipated 
the fair value of the swap instrument as of june   was approximately 
million 
for further information  refer to the fair value of financial instruments and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this report
