item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel brand polyester fibers  and permaclear and ecoclear brand pet resins 
we are also the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
at december   we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of polyester staple fiber and billion pounds of pet resins worldwide at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
see item business recent developments for information concerning businesses discontinued in first quarter  and see outlook below for information on our ability to convert certain fiber capacity to pet packaging resins 
our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments the fibers and recycled products group or frpg and the packaging products group or ppg 
the frpg produces fortrel fibers  which are primarily used in apparel  home furnishings  and industrial products 
these fibers are produced from two chemical raw materials  purified terephthalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg 
in addition  fortrel polyester and nylon for use primarily in fiberfill  non wovens  and carpet fibers are manufactured from recycled pet raw materials  including post consumer containers and post industrial materials 
our permaclear pet resins are produced by the ppg from pta and meg and ecoclear pet resins are produced from a combination of chemical and post consumer recycled raw materials 
these resins are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical 
it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber and textile product imports 
imports of products throughout the textile chain continue to impact the united states fiber markets  adversely affecting profitability 
both north american and global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
our profitability is primarily determined by our raw material margins  which is the difference between product selling prices and raw material costs 
both fiber and pet resin raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of changes in raw material margins is significant 
a 
change in raw material margin on approximately billion pounds of fiber and resin volume results in an annual change of approximately million in pretax income 
selling prices and raw material costs each may be affected by actions of our competitors  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we have established a reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables 
these judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances 
at december   we had customers with a receivable balance greater than million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the value of the inventory based upon our forecasted plans to sell the inventories 
the physical condition ie  quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these judgments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements for various reasons  including changes in future economic conditions  customer inventory levels  or competitive conditions that differ from our expectations 
changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed on the straight line method and the units of production method 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our capital strategy  or changes to our business model could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates  in which case our earnings could be affected 
long lived assets  including goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist and undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts  we recognize an impairment loss 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes in our business model  or changes in our operating performance 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the recorded value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits our pension benefit costs and liabilities are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to  the selection of the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared to external benchmarks to assure our pension obligations are properly stated 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could affect our pension expense and related funding requirements 
environmental liability our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with these statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in january application of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in our net earnings of approximately million  or per diluted share 
we did not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives at december  in addition  we have completed our initial assessment of goodwill for impairment using the two step approach described in sfas no 
and determined that the goodwill related to our frpg segment is impaired 
as required by the statement  the carrying value of this goodwill will be reduced by approximately million to its implied fair value by recording the reduction as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our first quarter financial statements 
goodwill has previously been evaluated for impairment by comparing the entity level unamortized goodwill balance to projected undiscounted cash flows  which did not result in an indicated i mpairment 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas in january as a result of a march decision related to our new fiber strategy see recent developments new fiber strategy  in accordance with this statement  we will report the net assets of our poy business and our small recycled textile polyester staple fiber business as assets held for sale with related income or loss from the operations of those net assets and any gain or loss relating to the disposal of the assets as discontinued operations 
the property  plant and equipment had a carrying value of approximately million at december   and will be reflected in our first quarter financial statements at their fair value less cost of disposal 
any adjustment to the carrying value of those assets will also be recorded as discontinued operations 
we have not determined the effect the adoption of this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position 
change in inventory valuation the earnings and balance sheet data for all prior periods have been restated to reflect our change from the last in  first out lifo to the first in  first out fifo method of inventory accounting that occurred in the third quarter we believe the change is preferable because it provides more meaningful financial information of our performance to management and shareholders  we expect inventory costs and quantities to decrease  and the fifo method is the predominant method used by our competitors 
for more information on the accounting change  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
new fiber strategy in january  we announced plans to refocus the strategy of our polyester fibers business in order to be less dependent on commodity fibers 
we plan to direct our production capacity toward more differentiated  higher value added products  taking advantage of our unique production capabilities of polymer and extrusion fiber manufacturing and our chemical and recycled based raw material sources 
we believe that this new strategy will enable us to face the competitive challenges presented by the imports of textile and apparel fiber and finished goods that continue to adversely affect the domestic fibers market  particularly the domestic commodity textile market 
as a result of our review of strategic alternatives  in march we decided to sell our poy business and our small recycled textile polyester staple fiber business with manufacturing facilities located in fayetteville  north carolina and marion  south carolina  respectively 
these two businesses will be reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements for the first quarter of idle assets we completed the construction of our pearl river facility in this facility consists of two resin lines and one staple fiber line 
the resin lines were completed in a portion of the staple fiber line commenced operation in the second quarter of this line operated at approximately half of its capacity since certain of its critical components did not meet specifications 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of  we incurred additional expenses due to the inefficient operation of this line 
by december  we remedied the mechanical problems 
however  we idled the staple fiber line because of the expected over supply of polyester staple fiber in the united states in the activities necessary to idle our pearl river staple fiber line increased costs in the fourth quarter of as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  in december see outlook below for information on our ability to utilize the idle fiber line 
we currently intend to announce our plans for utilizing these assets by the end of the second quarter production outages in may  we experienced a production outage at our palmetto plant in darlington  south carolina  which resulted in a temporary shutdown of the entire facility 
the power outage caused lost production volumes of approximately million pounds  split equally between our two reportable operating segments 
total costs and property damage associated with this outage was approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we reduced our property damage expense for that portion of the insurance claim by million 
in addition to property damage and other costs  we estimated we incurred lost profits of approximately million  resulting from lost sales in the second and third quarters 
we calculated lost profits by assuming the lost production was sold at the average selling price of comparable products during the second quarter of however  results may have been different if the actual product mix  volume  and pricing had differed from our assumptions 
in the fourth quarter of  we settled our property damage and business interruption insurance claims and recorded additional income of approximately million 
as a result  we estimated our full year unreimbursed financial impact was million million after tax  or per diluted share 
in august  we experienced production outages in our pet resin production process primarily resulting from an electrical failure 
in addition  in september we experienced reduced levels of production in our manufacturing facilities in the carolinas due to a hurricane 
total costs associated with these production outages were approximately million  of which million was recorded as an insurance receivable for property damages in the additional costs associated with these events increased the pretax loss for by approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  we settled the outstanding claim under our business interruption insurance policy relating to these outages and recorded income of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share 
these costs and the related income from business interruption insurance were reflected in cost of sales 
results of operations compared to total net sales for decreased to  million from  million for this decrease was primarily due to lower volumes in our frpg business 
net sales for the ppg increased to million in from million in  reflecting higher volumes that were partially offset by slightly lower selling prices in our pet resins business 
pet resin sales increased in the first half of  reflecting both higher volumes and improved selling prices 
however  the pet resins domestic business experienced severe selling price pressures in the second half of in spite of improving industry capacity utilization 
in both the north american and european markets  industry inventory liquidation by pet resins end users resulted in decreased selling volumes  which exacerbated selling price and margin erosion toward the end of the year 
net sales for the frpg decreased to million in from million in  due to lower volumes and lower selling prices resulting from the depressed state of the domestic fibers market 
during  fibers end users continued to lose market share in the domestic textile and apparel retail market to imports  resulting in approximately textile mill closings 
during this same period  polyester staple fiber capacity continued to decline  continuing the trend of the last several years 
in  approximately million pounds of staple fiber capacity  or approximately of the market capacity  was either shuttered or converted to other polyester products by the polyester fibers industry 
cost of sales decreased to million in from million in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for during  our operations were negatively impacted by a production outage and higher raw material costs 
ppg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to frpg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  primarily due to higher unabsorbed costs resulting from lower production volumes and higher raw material costs 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit was adversely affected by the production outage 
the gross profit margin was in compared to in during the second quarter of  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan  which was completed in the fourth quarter of in  we recognized restructuring income of million million after tax  or per diluted share  from over accruals related to this plan 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in  partially due to increased selling costs of new products  wage increases  and increased professional fees 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million for compared to million for net interest expense was million in both and our effective tax rate for was compared to for the principal items affecting our rate are foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates lower than us rates  and amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
the net effect of these two items was a reduction in the tax rate 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for compared to total net sales for increased to  million from million for this increase was primarily due to improved selling prices and increased volumes for the ppg 
net sales for the frpg increased to million in from million in  due to improved fiber selling prices 
net sales for the ppg increased to million in from million in  reflecting significantly improved selling prices and increased volume from having a full year s production from the two pet resin lines at the pearl river facility that started up during the first half of cost of sales increased to million in from million in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for during  our operations were negatively impacted by significantly higher raw material costs  higher energy costs primarily natural gas  costs associated with commencing the staple fiber operations at the pearl river facility  a charge relating to the activities necessary to idle the pearl river staple fiber production assets see above  and the impact of the euro 
the effect of these items was offset in part by income from business interruption insurance of million million after tax in  compared with an additional expense of million million after tax related to the production outages in  and cost savings associated with the restructuring 
for additional information  see production outages above and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
frpg s cost of sales as a percen tage of sales increased in the period compared to the period 
this increase was primarily due to significantly higher raw material costs  energy costs and start up costs of the staple fiber line at the pearl river facility  which more than offset higher selling prices and improved results from our european fibers business 
ppg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased in compared to  resulting primarily from significantly higher pet resin selling prices and higher unit volumes  offset in part by higher chemical raw material costs 
in addition  the prior period was affected by a production outage as discussed above 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in during the second quarter of  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan 
as a result  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge in our earnings of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the restructuring was completed in the fourth quarter of in  we recognized restructuring income of million million after tax  or per diluted share  from over accruals 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in these expenses declined primarily as a result of our cost reduction and productivity improvement plan and savings associated with our closed facilities  offset in part by discounts taken on accounts receivable sold 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million for compared to an operating loss of million for net interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was due to less interest being capitalized in relating to the construction in progress at the pearl river facility and higher interest rates  offset in part by a lower level of debt 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for the rate for decreased primarily as a result of improved earnings in our european operations that is taxed at a rate significantly lower than us rates 
effective january   we adopted the aicpa s statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  which required us to begin expensing all start up and organization costs as incurred 
start up and organization costs incurred prior to the adoption of this sop were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change increased our net loss for by million million  less taxes of million  or per diluted share 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
we expect profitability from continuing operations throughout however  while we expect to report income from continuing operations in the first quarter  we will have a net loss due to the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to goodwill discussed below and the effect of discontinued operations 
see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements above for additional information 
during february  announcements were made that the us selling price of pet resins would increase by 
per pound effective april  we expect the higher selling price in pet resins and improved industry capacity utilization to result in higher margins and profitability in over however  given the competitive nature of our business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that price increases or margin improvements will occur or be maintained throughout the year 
we expect north american and global demand for pet resins to grow and capacity utilization to improve during the next several years 
we have the ability to add up to million pounds of low cost annual pet resin capacity by utilizing the idle staple fiber assets at our pearl river facility and or the polyester resins assets at our palmetto facility that are now servicing the poy business that we are selling 
we will look to the best alternatives of quality  process cost and capital cost as we decide on our strategy for utilizing these assets 
we intend to take advantage of the anticipated growth in demand in the pet resins market and to grow as that market grows 
we intend to announce our plans by mid year for information on our new fibers strategy and the discontinuance of our poy business and our small textile polyester staple fiber business  see item business recent developments 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  our net earnings will benefit from the adoption of this statement by approximately million  or per diluted share when compared to our initial assessment of the impairment of goodwill as required by the statement has indicated that a charge of approximately million is required 
this charge will be recorded in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we have not quantified the effect the adoption of this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position 
for additional information  see impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements above 
in  we intend to use cash generated from operations to pay down debt 
the following are certain key financial estimates for volume estimates pet resin billion pounds fibers 
billion pounds depreciation and amortization to million capital expenditures to million increased costs of new fiber strategy to million including research and development costs environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the majority of the identified situations are found at our largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
we believe that we a re entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  net expenses associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties 
capital resources and liquidity our overall cash needs for were primarily provided from operations 
net cash provided by operations was million for compared to million for this increase is primarily due to lower accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in investments in both years included capital expenditures to maintain our business 
in our investing activities included approximately million of capital expenditures to complete our pearl river facility 
for information about expected capital expenditures in  see outlook above 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in net repayments of long term debt amounted to million in compared to million in this resulted from lower capital expenditures and improved cash flow from operations in the following table describes our debt facilities  providing details as to the maturity of these facilities and amounts outstanding at december   as well as available funding from both committed and uncommitted facilities 
table i december  in millions maturity total facility commitment amount outstanding amounts available under all facilities amounts available under committed facilities uncommitted lines of credit n a n a day facility sept prudential note feb revolving bank facility sept metropolitan note nov hancock note dec industrial revenue bonds financial instruments n a n a total we have uncommitted lines of credit from banks that participate in our revolving credit facility and from other banks 
generally these lines of credit can be terminated at any time as long as we have not borrowed against them 
we use these lines to borrow at competitive rates on a short term basis 
we initially established the million unsecured day revolving credit facility as a back up liquidity facility in certain banks participating in the facility renewed their commitments in and upon renewal of the facility in september some banks either elected to renew at their same amount  increase  reduce  or did not renew their commitment 
as a result  we currently have approximately million in committed availability 
we have never utilized this facility and we do not expect to utilize it in the future 
we borrowed million from prudential insurance company in february at an interest rate of as senior unsecured indebtedness with a single principal payment due in february in conjunction with this financing  we entered into interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the total amount of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
see below for more information about our derivative financial instruments 
we initially entered into a year million unsecured revolving credit agreement in september in april  we voluntarily reduced the commitment to million 
amounts borrowed under this facility are borrowed at floating rates and normally have maturities of six months or less  although it is possible to borrow until september  the maturity date of the facility 
we borrowed million from metropolitan life insurance company in november as senior unsecured indebtedness at a floating interest rate based on libor with a single principal payment due in november we borrowed million from hancock life insurance company in december as senior unsecured indebtedness at an interest rate of with a single principal payment due in december in conjunction with this financing  we entered into interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the total amount of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
we issued million of industrial revenue bonds in the s 
these are senior unsecured bonds that mature on various dates beginning in these bonds bear interest at a floating rate and are supported by letters of credit that may be terminated upon months notice 
if a letter of credit is terminated  we would have to replace it  arrange for other security  or redeem the bonds 
we have various financial instruments described above  in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial instruments have a net value at december  of approximately million that is accounted for as a reduction of our debt obligations 
in addition to our debt commitments  we have entered into other commitments and contractual obligations that obligate us to make specified payments in the future 
the following table summarizes the total amounts due as of december  under all long term debt agreements see the amounts outstanding in the table above  commitments and other contractual obligations 
the table indicates the years in which payments are due under the contractual obligations 
historically  we have been able to pay  renew or refinance these contractual obligations in advance of their termination dates and expect to maintain this ability for the foreseeable future 
see forward looking statements  risk and uncertainties 
table ii payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt see table i receivables securitization operating leases including sale and leaseback raw material purchase obligations total we entered into a receivables securitization program in may that enables us to sell certain accounts receivable at a discount 
this type of funding permits us to obtain funds at a rate lower than the borrowing rates available on our uncommitted lines or our revolving credit agreements 
the program was structured as a day facility with the expectation that the program would be renewed annually 
we have renewed the program twice and expect to continue to renew the program 
if the program were not renewed or replaced  we would not be able to sell our receivables in this manner and our receivables and debt would each increase by the amount of the receivables that would otherwise have been sold at that time 
the resin assets at our palmetto facility were sold in june in a sale and leaseback transaction 
the equipment was purchased from us for its fair market value as verified by an independent appraisal of million 
under the year operating lease we entered into for this equipment  our rental payments are approximately million annually  which is lower than the financing cost we otherwise would have incurred if we had borrowed the fair market value of the equipment at the time of the transaction 
by june the end of the lease term  we expect to either renew or replace the lease or purchase the equipment for million 
if this program were terminated  we expect our fixed assets and debt would each increase by million 
in addition to this transaction  we have normal operating leases with aggregate rental payments approximating million in and varying amounts thereafter 
we have entered into several contracts for varying terms of up to years to purchase raw materials 
we have agreed to make unconditional minimum annual payments of million per year with respect to one of these contracts that expires in december if certain conditions relating to this supply contract are not met  we could be required to pay the present value of approximately five years payments in if this were to occur  our debt would increase by approximately million 
this contract represents less than one third of our annual raw material purchases 
except for certain of the contractual obligations discussed above  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
many of the contractual obligations in table ii contain provisions that change the costs of the obligations eg  interest rates based on our credit ratings 
in we were rated as investment grade by both rating agencies 
we are currently rated bb with a stable outlook by standard and poor s s p non investment grade and baa with a negative outlook by moody s investors service moody s investment grade 
after s p s recent changes to our rating  we expect our costs under these contractual obligations to increase by approximately million in compared to if we are not rated as investment grade by both s p and moody s  our costs under these contractual agreements would increase by approximately million in compared to substantially all of the contractual obligations in table ii contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
the principal financial covenants require that we maintain a debt to capital ratio of less than and a ratio of ebitda earnings before charges for interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from continuing operations to our net interest expense both for the previous four quarters of greater than to at december   our debt to capital ratio was and our ratio of ebitda to net interest was to these obligations also contain covenants that prohibit liens except in certain situations 
certain subsidiaries have guaranteed substantially all of our indebtedness for borrowed money 
these obligations also contain cross acceleration and cross payment default provisions for amounts greater than million 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  if current business conditions deteriorate or certain events occur including those set forth in forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below  we may breach these covenants  in which case substantially all of these contractual obligations would immediately become due and payable 
if this occurred  there is no certainty these obligations could be refinanced 
if these obligations were refinanced under those circumstances  there is a high probability that we would incur increased costs and some or all of the contractual obligations would be classified as debt on our balance sheet 
we have an effective registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to issue up to million of debt and or equity securities 
access to public debt and equity markets  however  is dependent upon a variety of factors  including general market conditions and investors perceptions regarding our industry and our expected performance 
we have not sold any securities under the shelf registration 
the financial resources available to us at december  included million under our revolving credit facilities and unused short term uncommitted lines of credit  the public and private debt and equity markets  and internally generated funds 
based on our debt level as of december   we could have had an average of approximately million of additional debt outstanding during the year without amending the terms of our debt agreements 
our current financing sources are primarily dependent on the bank and commercial paper markets since these are the lowest cost funds available 
the availability and cost of these funds can change in a short period of time for a variety of reasons 
as a result  we cannot be sure that low cost financing will continue to be available to us 
however  we believe our financial resources will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends

in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to us 
economic conditions affect the supply and demand of our products 
capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting our financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions 
worldwide supply is expanding for both fiber and resins 
any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce our profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the financial condition of our customers impacts our profitability 
our customers include textile mills  yarn spinners  the injection molding industry and the manufacturers of plastic containers 
although the frpg does not have any single customer that has a material effect on the segment  the ppg has five customers that represented approximately of the ppg s total net sales in if our customers have financial difficulties  this could affect our profitability by decreasing our sales and or resulting in the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
fiber and textile imports continue to adversely impact our margins 
the us and european fiber and textile markets continue to be severely impacted by imports  principally from far eastern countries 
imports of fiber and fiber products continue to cause an over supply which decreases fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports have and are expected to continue to significantly impact the profitability of our businesses 
our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  a disruption in their businesses or a failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the precautions we have taken would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
the availability and costs of our financing could adversely affect our profitability 
certain events could reduce our access to financing and or increase our financing costs 
we are dependent on the banks and commercial paper markets for our financing 
these markets are volatile and the availability of financing and interest rates fluctuate based on conditions in the markets and lenders perception of our business 
the bank markets can be influenced by the economy  by the general credit environment  by the credit environment of our industry  and by the performance of the individual financial institution 
the commercial paper markets can be influenced by other financial markets 
in addition  our ability to borrow at competitive costs is influenced by our public debt ratings 
significant disruptions in these markets or lowering of our credit ratings could reduce our access to funds and or increase our cost of funds 
in addition  if current business conditions deteriorated or other events occurred that resulted in a breach of our covenants under our debt and certain other contractual obligations  all amounts due under these obligations would immediately become due and payable 
if this occurred  there is no certainty these obligations could be refinanced and  if they were  we would probably incur increased costs and some or all of the obligations would be classified as debt on our balance sheet 
for additional information  see capital resources and liquidity above 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability 
a large portion of our profitability is earned in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our profitability and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency 
a portion of the net assets of these subsidiaries is denominated in other than their functional currency 
while we reduce our foreign currency exposure by using appropriate hedges  our foreign subsidiaries still have net assets denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and may experience foreign exchange losses 
as a result  a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability 
regulatory changes may affect the demand for our products 
some of the end uses of our products are subject to federal and or state regulations 
adverse changes in these regulations could affect the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 
additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities 
we have entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of our business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
increases in energy costs could adversely affect our profitability 
increases in energy costs impact our profitability by increasing our raw materials costs and production costs 
the prices of substantially all of our raw materials are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs 
our facilities utilize natural gas as their primary energy source  although some have the ability to switch a portion of their consumption to fuel oil 
an increase in these costs could adversely affect our profitability 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs and future estimated costs for identified environmental situations may change 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies  we could have higher future environmental expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because our obligations under our bank facilities  bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
a increase in market interest rates from those at december  and would reduce income before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively  and reduce cash flow from operations by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate financial instruments at december  exactly match the terms of the million of fixed rate debt 
any potential decrease in the fair value of our interest rate financial instruments will be offset by changes in the value of our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are primarily used to hedge certain accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
