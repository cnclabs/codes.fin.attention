business overview and discussion of known trends we develop  manufacture and market minimally invasive products that use radiofrequency energy to treat patients with solid cancerous or benign tumors 
from inception in through  our operations consisted primarily of various start up activities  including development of technologies central to our business  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
in  we began commercial product shipments 
in  we commercially launched our starburst xli family of disposable devices and significantly expanded our direct domestic sales organization and our international distribution network 
our products are sold in the united states through our direct sales force and internationally through distribution partners 
for the year ended december   sales in the united states accounted for of our total sales while sales in our international markets accounted for of our total sales 
we expect domestic sales to account for an increasing percentage of total sales in future years due to our significant investment in our domestic sales force and because  at least for  our premium priced starburst xli family of disposable needles will only be distributed in the united states 
conversely  we expect reimbursement issues in europe and japan to limit sales growth in these regions for the next several years 
however  our international operations will continue to represent a significant  if decreasing  portion of our revenue because of the high incidence of primary liver cancer in asian and european markets 
all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our disposable devices and radiofrequency generators 
for the year ended december   of our sales were derived from our disposable devices and were derived from the sale of our generators 
we will continue to focus on expanding our base of customer accounts and on increasing usage of our disposable products in our established accounts 
as a result  revenue from our higher margin disposable devices should continue to grow faster than revenue from our generators 
to date  essentially all of our revenue has come from products sold in the treatment of cancerous liver tumors 
in  we expect some additional revenue in the fourth quarter to come from the use of the rita system sold for the treatment of patients with metastatic bone tumors  and nominal revenue at the end of from sales for the treatment of unresectable lung tumors 
we are conducting research and clinical trials in other organs that may lead to additional sources of revenue in the years beyond our manufacturing costs consist of raw materials  including generators produced for us by third party suppliers  labor to produce our disposable devices and to inspect incoming  in process and finished goods  sterilization performed by an outside service provider and general overhead expenses 
gross margins are affected by production volumes  average selling prices  the sales mix of higher margin disposable devices versus generators and the mix of domestic direct sales versus international sales  which provide for standard distributor discounts 
our gross margin improved in  increasing to from in  in response to the increasing percentages of domestic business and disposable products in our sales mix and lower unit costs driven by higher production volumes 
we expect gross margins to continue to improve in the near term primarily as a result of continued improvements in our sales mix and cost factors and also due to the growing acceptance of our premium priced starburst xli line of disposable devices 
for the year ended december   of our operating expenses were related to research and development activities  down from in we expect our research and development activities to continue to grow more slowly than sales and marketing activities  at least through  as we commit significantly more resources to market development and business expansion efforts 
selling  general and administrative activities represented of our operating expenses for the year  up from in this increase resulted from investments in the expansion of our domestic sales force and international distribution support activities as well as physician training and patient awareness programs 
also  because our collection periods in europe have grown longer as a result of difficult economic conditions  we increased our allowance for uncollectible accounts to of gross trade receivables as of december   from at december  this increase further affected growth in administrative expense 
while our investments in market growth and business development will continue to grow  we believe the deterioration we experienced in our european collections in will begin to stabilize as the global economy improves and that the need to increase our allowance for uncollectible accounts will moderate 
our working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to cash used to fund operations 
however  our investments in accounts receivable and inventory increased during the year 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  were million at december   up from million at december  this increase was due to our increasing sales volume and to a significant lengthening of collection cycle with our european distributors 
inventory  net of reserves  was million at december   up from million at december  inventory growth was driven by increasing sales volume and temporary investments intended to support the market introduction of new products 
in connection with grants of stock options to employees and non employees  we record deferred stock based compensation as a component of stockholders equity 
this stock based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for the year ended december  we expect to record additional amortization expense for deferred compensation  in diminishing amounts  through  at which point our existing deferred stock base compensation will be fully amortized 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
due to the high costs associated with continued research and development programs  expanded clinical research programs and increased sales and marketing efforts  we expect to incur net losses for the full year  but losses should diminish through the first three quarters of the year  and we expect to be modestly profitable in the fourth quarter of profitability beyond will depend on our success in expanding product usage in our current market and in developing new markets 
to the extent current or new markets do not materialize in accordance with our expectations  our sales and profitability could be lower than expected and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
we are currently involved in patent proceedings and may become a party to additional patent or product liability proceedings 
the costs of such lawsuits or proceedings may be material and could affect our earnings and financial position 
an adverse outcome in a patent lawsuit could require us to cease sales of affected products or to pay royalties and or license fees  which could harm our results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe the following accounting policies have been critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe users of our financial statements  including potential and current investors  will find an explanation of these policies important to understanding our discussions of financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a more extensive review of all accounting policies considered to be significant in the preparation of our financial statements appears in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers  who are primarily private companies in the united states  europe and asia 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and past transaction credit worthiness and generally require no collateral 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our assessment of the likelihood of collection of individual accounts 
this allowance may prove to be inadequate if collections fail to meet current estimates  which could occur as a result of general economic conditions or the insolvency of specific key customers 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
we maintain a reserve for obsolete  unmarketable or excess product based on assumptions regarding future demand or market conditions 
we may be required to make further provisions to our reserve if market conditions prove less favorable than our current expectations  or if the introduction of new products renders existing products obsolete 
litigation costs in august  we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california against radiotherapeutics corporation 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k  the complaint alleges that radiotherapeutics radiofrequency ablation products infringe six of our patents 
the litigation costs thereby incurred in defense of our patents  approximately  as of december   have been capitalized 
amortization of this asset has been matched to the remaining life of the six patents  approximately years 
although we expect a favorable outcome in this matter  an unsuccessful outcome would require an immediate charge to earnings of any remaining unamortized costs 
it is probable that additional litigation costs will be capitalized in future periods 
contingencies in addition to the complaint described in the preceding paragraph  we are involved in a patent interference proceeding in the united states with radiotherapeutics corporation in which the validity of one of our patents has been called into question 
although we believe we have meritorious defenses  we could be prevented from selling the rita system or be required to pay license fees and or royalties on past and future product sales if we do not prevail in this interference proceeding 
further  we are involved in a patent opposition currently pending before the european patent office 
the principal parties in this opposition are radiotherapeutics and rita 
radiotherapeutics seeks to have our only european patent declared invalid 
in february  the european patent office determined that we were entitled to this patent  european patent no 
 but appeals of this decision are likely and a final decision is not expected in this opposition proceeding for several years 
if we do not prevail in the opposition proceeding  we could lose our only currently issued patent in europe 
both the interference proceeding in the united states and the european opposition proceeding are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form form k 
as of december   it is not possible to estimate additional probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
although we do not currently believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by rulings that are unfavorable to us 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon receipt of a customer purchase order and subsequent product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the associated receivable is deemed probable 
this policy is applied to all of our customers  including our distributors  who have no price protection and no return rights on product purchased 
should changes in conditions or the status of obligations cause us to determine that our criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we do not generally engage in bundling transactions that would call for the deferral of revenue 
through december   all of our billings have been denominated in us dollars  although we expect relatively minor billings in foreign currencies in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our statements of operations for the years ended december   and respectively years ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative 
total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net net loss years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of from million in we experienced growth in both domestic and international markets  with domestic sales increasing by and international sales increasing by over the previous year 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total revenue  as compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by and generator sales decreased by compared with results 
also  for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  up from in higher unit shipments of generators and disposables resulted from increased physician awareness of our technology  a major expansion of our domestic sales force  increased geographical representation through the appointment of new international distributors and the launch of our starburst xli family of disposable devices 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the growth in cost of goods sold was attributable primarily to higher material  labor  and overhead costs associated with increased unit shipments 
included in cost of goods sold was amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  down from  in excluding the effect of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  gross margins improved to in from in the improvement was due to higher average selling prices of our disposable devises  related to the launch of our premium priced five and seven centimeter starburst xli electrodes  and to the increasing proportions of domestic business and disposable products in our sales mix 
gross margins also benefited from manufacturing efficiencies attained through higher volume production of our disposable devices 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this increase was due to expenses associated with the development of our next generation technology  increased clinical program spending  and increased spending related to the growth and protection of our patent portfolio 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development  although research and development expense may fall in as most of the development costs of the new starburst xli disposable device have already been recognized 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the major expansion of our domestic sales organization  additional investments in market development and public relations  and administrative expenses relating to provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our sales organization  invest in marketing and public relations and add personnel 
interest income was million for the years ended december  and although average daily cash balances were higher in than in  lower market interest rates resulted in no growth in interest income 
interest expense for was  down from  in  as a result of repayment during the year of bank debt  all of which had been eliminated by june years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of from million in we experienced growth in both domestic and international markets  with domestic sales increasing and international sales increasing over the previous year 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total revenue  as compared to in we experienced growth in sales of our disposable products and our generators  with disposable product sales increasing and generator sales increasing over the previous year 
for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  as compared to in higher unit shipments of generators and disposables resulted from increased physician awareness of our technology  a major expansion of our domestic sales force  increased geographical representation through the appointment of new international distributors and the launch of our model generator and starburst family of disposable devices 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the growth in cost of goods sold was attributable primarily to higher material  labor  and overhead costs associated with increased unit shipments 
included in cost of goods sold was amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in excluding the effect of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  gross margins improved to in from in the improvement was due in part to an increase in average selling prices of our disposable devices  related to the launch of our five centimeter starburst xl electrode 
the improvement was also the result of the increase in higher margin disposable devices as a proportion of total sales 
gross margins also benefited from manufacturing efficiencies attained through higher volume production of our disposable devices 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the expense increase was due to additional personnel  expenses associated with the development of our next generation technology  increased clinical program spending  increased spending related to the growth and protection of our patent portfolio and increases in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year ended december  as compared to  in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the expense increase was primarily attributable to the major expansion of our domestic sales organization  increased administrative expenses due to added personnel to support our growth in operations  the costs associated with our operation as a public company and increases in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
for the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million as compared to  in interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to  in the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to earnings on short term investments made with cash received from our initial public offering of common shares completed in the third quarter of interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the increase in interest expense for was attributable to higher average debt outstanding on the loan and security agreement entered into in june during the third quarter of  we repaid all debt outstanding under our term loans  and during the fourth quarter of  we repaid  of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  bringing our bank debt outstanding to  at december  liquidity and capital resources prior to august  we financed our operations principally through private placements of convertible preferred stock  raising approximately million net of expenses 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  raising approximately million net of expenses 
all outstanding convertible preferred shares were converted to common shares at that time 
to a lesser extent  we also financed our operations through equipment financing and other loans see below  which totaled million in principal outstanding at december  and million at december  as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  million in investments intended for resale and million of working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss and increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from higher revenues  a lengthened collection cycle and increased unit shipments 
our investing activities for the year were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of million and net purchases or sales of short term investment instruments 
net cash used by financing activities for the year was million  as payments on bank debt and lease obligations exceeded the proceeds received from issuance of common stock 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss and increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from higher revenues and increased unit shipments 
our investing activities for the year ended december  were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of  and net purchases or sales of short term investment instruments 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  attributable to our initial public offering of common shares  partially offset by borrowings and repayment of debt 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement for a loan facility of up to million 
the facility consisted of two term loans of million each and a revolving credit note of up to million 
as of december   borrowings under the term loans had been completely repaid and we had a balance outstanding of  on the revolving credit note  bearing interest at over the prime rate 
this balance was paid as scheduled in and the loan facility was cancelled 
we have also  from time to time  financed equipment through capital and operating leases 
as of december   our future minimum payments due under capital and operating leases are as follows future minimum capital lease payments payments due in less imputed interest including warrants present value of future minimum capital lease payments future minimum operating lease payments total of future minimum operating lease payments  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  available to offset future regular taxable income 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets  however  because realization of favorable tax assets in future returns is very uncertain 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of the company  and our utilization of our carryforwards could be restricted

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going forward 
the amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of sfas the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of we believe that adoption of these standards will have no impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
and apb  however  this statement retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  addressing the recognition  measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to its customers  without charge  and which customers may then use in  or exercise as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
sales incentives falling within the scope of eitf issue no 
include offers that customers may use to receive a reduction in the price of products or services at the point of sale 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  addressing whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment to the selling prices of the vendor s products and therefore a deduction from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and therefore a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
in september  the eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf issues no

 became effective for annual or interim financial statements dated after december   and include a requirement to reclassify the financial statements of prior periods as necessary to conform with current income statement display standards 
no material impact on our financial statements has resulted from the adoption of the above eitf issues 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business and prospects 
due to our dependence on the rita system  failure to achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could harm our business 
because all of our revenue comes from the sale of the rita system  our financial performance will depend upon physician adoption and patient awareness of this system 
if we are unable to convince physicians to use the rita system  we may not be able to generate revenues because we do not have alternative products 
we are currently involved in a patent interference action and a patent opposition action involving radiotherapeutics corporation  and if we do not prevail in these actions  we may be unable to sell the rita system 
in july  the united states patent and trademark office declared an interference involving us  which was provoked by radiotherapeutics corporation  a competitor of ours  in which the validity of a patent claim previously issued to us is being called into question 
the claim being questioned is one of a number of issued patent claims that cover the curvature of the array at the tip of our disposable devices 
in february  the uspto issued a decision on preliminary motions filed in the patent interference proceeding 
the decision found that one of the claims in our united states patent no 
 claim no 
is invalid 
we expect to receive final confirmation of that decision later this year 
in the event that the decision is confirmed  we plan to file a motion in a united states district court requesting review of the decision 
final determination of the patent interference proceeding may take several years 
if the final determination of the united states district court results in the issuance of patent rights related to the claim to radiotherapeutics and we were unable to obtain a license to use the relevant patent or successfully modify our disposable device  we could be unable to sell our system and our business could suffer 
in march  radiotherapeutics corporation filed an opposition to our european patent no 
this patent also covers the curvature of the array at the tip of our disposable devices 
in this opposition  the validity of our issued patent is being questioned 
in february  the european patent office determined that we were entitled to european patent no 
a final decision is not expected in this proceeding for several years 
if we do not prevail in the opposition proceeding  we could lose our only currently issued patent in europe 
we have a history of losses  anticipate significant increases in our operating expenses over the next several years and may never achieve profitability 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales and marketing  manufacturing  clinical research and product development efforts 
in addition  we have charged operating expense to increase our allowance for uncollectible accounts in connection with lengthening collection periods for our accounts in europe 
to become profitable  we must continue to increase our sales 
if sales do not continue to grow  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
in particular  we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
because we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we compete directly with two companies in the domestic and international markets radiotherapeutics corporation  a division of boston scientific corporation  and radionics  inc  a division of tyco healthcare  which is a division of tyco international 
boston scientific corporation and tyco international are publicly traded companies with substantially greater resources than we have 
both radiotherapeutics and radionics sell products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
alternative therapies could prove to be superior to the rita system  and physician adoption could be negatively affected 
in addition to competing against other companies offering products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue  we also compete against companies developing  manufacturing and marketing alternative therapies that address both cancerous and benign tumors 
if these alternative therapies prove to offer treatment options that are superior to our system  physician adoption of our products could be negatively affected and our revenues could decline 
we currently lack long term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our products and may find that long term data does not support our short term clinical results 
our products are supported by an average clinical follow up of between five and months in published clinical reports 
if longer term studies fail to confirm the effectiveness of our products  our sales could decline 
if longer term patient follow up or clinical studies indicate that our procedures cause unexpected  serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
further  because some of our data has been produced in studies that were not randomized and or included small patient populations  our clinical data may not be reproduced in wider patient populations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we may lose market share to a competitor and our business could suffer 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet we may be unable to do so 
a number of companies in our market  as well as universities and research institutions  have issued patents and have filed patent applications that relate to the use of radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
our pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be extensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  confidentiality agreements executed by our employees  consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights we could lose market share to a competitor and our business could suffer 
if we are sued for patent infringement  we could be prevented from selling our products and our business could suffer 
we are aware of the existence of patents held by competitors in our market  which could result in a patent lawsuit against us 
in the event that we are subject to a patent infringement lawsuit and if the relevant patents were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe  we could be prevented from selling our products unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign the product to avoid infringement 
if we were unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign our system  we may be prevented from selling our system and our business could suffer 
our dependence on international revenues  which account for a significant portion of our revenues  could harm our business 
because our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to grow product sales in international markets  we are exposed to risks specific to business operations outside the united states 
these risks include 
the challenge of managing international sales without direct access to the end customer  
the risk of inventory build up by our distributors which could negatively impact sales in future periods  
obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our devices in some foreign markets  
the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory requirements  
longer accounts receivable collection time  
significant currency fluctuations  which could cause our distributors to reduce the number of products they purchase from us because the cost of our products to them could increase relative to the price they could charge their customers  
reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  and 
contractual provisions governed by foreign laws 
we are substantially dependent on two distributors in our international markets  and if we lose either distributor or if either distributor significantly reduces their product demand  our international and total revenues could decline 
we are substantially dependent on a limited number of significant distributors in our international markets  and if we lose these distributors and fail to attract additional distributors  our international revenues could decline 
itx corporation  formerly known as nissho iwai corporation  is our primary distributor in asia 
it accounted for percent of our international revenues for the year ended december  and percent of our international revenues in mdh mdh forniture ospedaliere  our distributor in italy  accounted for percent of our international revenues for the year ended december  and percent of our international revenues for because international revenues accounted for percent of our total revenues for the year ended december  and these two distributors represented percent of that total  the loss of either distributor or a significant decrease in unit purchases by either distributor could cause revenues to decline substantially 
if we are unable to attract additional international distributors  our international revenues may not grow 
our relationships with third party distributors could negatively affect our sales 
we sell our products in international markets through third party distributors over whom we have limited control  and  if they fail to adequately support our products  our sales could decline 
if our distributors or we terminate our existing agreements  finding companies to replace them could be an expensive and time consuming process and sales could decrease during any transition period 
in addition  we are aware that some of our international distributors have built up inventory of our disposable devices 
as a result  future sales of our newer generation disposable devices by these distributors could be negatively impacted 
in addition  while these distributors have no price protection and no right of return relating to purchased products  if we permit the return of any of these products  we will have to adjust our revenues relating to these products 
if customers in markets outside the united states experience difficulty obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our products  international sales could decline 
certain of the markets outside the united states in which we sell our products require that specific reimbursement codes be obtained before reimbursement for procedures using our products can be approved 
as a result  in countries where specific reimbursement codes are strictly required and have not yet been issued  reimbursement has been denied on that basis 
itx  our distributor in japan  is conducting studies that are necessary to obtain reimbursement coverage in japan  but to date has not yet received this approval 
if we are unable to either obtain the required reimbursement codes or develop an effective strategy to resolve the reimbursement issue  physicians may be unwilling to purchase our products which could negatively impact our international revenues 
if third party payors do not reimburse health care providers for use of the rita system  purchases could be delayed and our revenues could decline 
physicians  hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase our products if they do not receive substantial reimbursement for the cost of the procedures using our products from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and private health insurance plans 
although we were notified in february by the american medical association that specific reimbursement codes for radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors have been established  they reserve the right to reverse this decision 
in this case  we would be required to reapply for a specific code 
this process is time consuming and costly and may require us to provide extensive supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for our products to the american medical association 
even though we were successful in establishing a new code  a payor still may not reimburse adequately for the procedure or product 
in addition  there is no specific reimbursement code for radiofrequency ablation of tumors in other organs 
further  we believe the advent of fixed payment schedules has made it difficult to receive reimbursement for disposable products  even if the use of these products improves clinical outcomes 
fixed payment schedules typically permit reimbursement for a procedure rather than a device 
if physicians believe that our system will add cost to a procedure but will not add sufficient offsetting economic or clinical benefits  physician adoption could be slowed 
you may have a difficult time evaluating our company as an investment because we have a limited operating history 
you can only evaluate our business based on a limited operating history because we began selling the rita system in this short history may not be adequate to enable you to fully assess our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products and respond to competition 
any failure to build and manage our direct sales organization may negatively affect our revenues 
we have significantly expanded our direct sales force in the united states over the past twelve months and plan to continue to increase the domestic direct sales force in the future 
there is intense competition for skilled sales and marketing employees  especially for people who have experience selling disposable devices and generators to the physicians in our target market  and we may be unable to hire skilled individuals to sell our products 
any inability to build and effectively manage our direct sales force could negatively impact our growth 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel and without additional employees  we cannot grow or achieve profitability 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and research and development staff 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of these individuals and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel  including sales and marketing staff 
the market for qualified management personnel in northern california  where our offices are located  is competitive and is expected to continue to be competitive 
because the environment for good personnel is so competitive  costs related to compensation may increase significantly 
if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel we need to support and grow our business  our business will suffer 
we may be subject to costly and time consuming product liability actions 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in both minimally invasive and open surgical procedures and as a result  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
to date  we have not been subject to a product liability claim  however  any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we could have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our core business 
any failure in our physician training efforts could result in lower than expected product sales 
it is critical to our sales effort to train a sufficient number of physicians and to instruct them properly in the procedures that utilize our products 
we have established formal physician training programs and rely on physicians to devote adequate time to understanding how and when our products should be used 
if physicians are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury and related liability or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our product sales 
we may incur significant costs related to a class action lawsuit due to the likely volatility of our stock 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including 
failure of the public market to support the valuation established in our initial public offering  
our ability to successfully commercialize our products  
announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors  
quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  
announcements of technological or competitive developments  
regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  
acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  
changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and 
general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and divert management s attention from our core business 
if we fail to support our anticipated growth in operations  our business could suffer 
if we fail to execute our sales strategy and develop further our products  our business could suffer 
to manage anticipated growth in operations  we must increase our quality assurance staff for both our generators and our disposable devices and expand our manufacturing staff and facility for our disposable devices 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our expected growth in operations 
we have limited experience manufacturing our disposable devices in substantial quantities  and if we are unable to hire sufficient additional personnel  purchase additional equipment or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand our business could suffer 
to be successful  we must manufacture our products in substantial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing quantities of our disposable devices that meet customer demand  we could lose customers and our business could suffer 
at the present time  we have limited high volume manufacturing experience 
our manufacturing operations are currently focused on the in house assembly of our disposable devices 
as we increase our manufacturing volume and the number of product designs for our disposable devices  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase 
because our manufacturing operations are primarily dependent upon manual assembly  if demand for our system increases we will need to hire additional personnel and may need to purchase additional equipment 
if we are unable to sufficiently staff our manufacturing operations or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on one supplier as the only source of a component that we use in our disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of this component could negatively affect our revenues 
because there is only one supplier that provides us with a component that we include in our disposable devices  a disruption in the supply of this component could negatively affect revenues 
this supplier is the only source of this component 
if we were unable to remedy a disruption in supply of this component within twelve months  we could be required to redesign the handle of our disposable devices  which could divert engineering resources from other projects or add to product costs 
in addition  a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require clearance prior to our marketing a product containing new materials 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time  and we may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any new material to be used in our products on a timely basis  if at all 
this could also create supply disruptions that could negatively affect our business 
we are dependent on third party contractors for the supply of our generators  and any failure to deliver generators to us could result in lower than expected revenues 
we are dependent on two third party suppliers to produce our generators 
while we have agreements with both of these suppliers  any delay in shipments of generators to us could result in our failure to ship generators to customers and could negatively affect revenues 
complying with the fda and other domestic and international regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to a host of federal  state  local and international regulations regarding the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in particular  our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in  among other things  seizures or recalls of our products  an injunction  substantial fines and or criminal charges against our employees and us 
the fda s medical device reporting regulations require us to report any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which our products malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval or clearance  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
for example  some of our newer products have not received approval in japan 
any failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our new products in foreign countries could negatively affect revenues 
product introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda regulatory process  which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
unless we are exempt  we must obtain the appropriate fda approval or clearance before we can sell a new medical device in the united states 
this can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
to date  all of our products have received clearances from the fda through premarket notification under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
however  if the fda requires us to submit a new premarket notification under section k for modifications to our existing products  or if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we now expect  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain premarket approval process 
in addition  modifications to medical device products cleared via the k process may require a new k submission 
we have made minor modifications to our system 
using the guidelines established by the fda  we have determined that some of these modifications do not require us to file new k submissions 
if the fda disagrees with our determinations  we may not be able to sell the rita system until the fda has cleared new k submissions for these modifications 
in addition  we intend to request additional label indications  such as approvals or clearances for the ablation of tumors in additional organs  including lung  bone and breast  for our current products 
the fda may either deny these requests outright  require additional extensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of approval or clearance 
therefore  obtaining necessary approvals or clearances for these additional applications could be an expensive and lengthy process 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future resulting in dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds for our business operations and to execute our business strategy 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
because our executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  own approximately percent of our outstanding common stock  these stockholders may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration of voting stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment portfolio  we have no interest rate sensitive borrowings as of that date 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall  and floating rate borrowings will lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  and our interest expense may be above our expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
the average contractual duration of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
all of our sales and purchases have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may begin to make sales in other currencies such as the euro 
we believe we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and that such risk in the future will be minimal
