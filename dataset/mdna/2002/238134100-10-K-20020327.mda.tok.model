item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an asp that provides edc and other services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
we assist our customers in accelerating the completion of clinical trials by streamlining the collection of data relating to clinical trials  and improving the overall quality of the clinical trial data collected 
through our clinical business  which we sold in  we operated a multi specialty site management organization that provided clinical research services to various clinical trial sponsors 

table of contents the discussion that follows highlights our business conditions and certain financial information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
approximately of our assets  or approximately million  are held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have recognized little edc revenue to date and have experienced significant losses and negative cash flow from operations 
we are continuing to develop and commercialize our business  and anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we use a technology platform that consists of windows compatible software and intranet hardware known as datatrak edc to provide edc and other services to clinical trial sponsors and cros 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of datatrak edc specifically 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercial acceptance of the datatrak process 
our contracts with our customers provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and we recognize revenue as these components or services are delivered 
services provided by us that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as completed 
generally  these contracts range in duration from one to three years 
the ultimate contract value is dependent upon the length of the customer s use of datatrak edc and the services we provide 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  we recognize revenue per the specific terms of each contract 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
our customers  with or without cause  can terminate a contract at any time 
if one of our contracts is cancelled  we are entitled to payment for all work performed through the date of notice of termination and for recovery of some or all costs incurred to terminate a contract 
the termination of a contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs we have previously recognized 
since our purchase of the datatrak edc software in january  we have recorded revenue related to a small number of contracts 
at december   our backlog was million 
backlog includes a million contract which is currently on hold 
in the future  we may also record revenue related to the sales and licensing of software 
due to our early stage of development and low level of backlog  we may continue to recognize low levels of revenue 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition and software development costs 
our revenue recognition and software development cost policies are stated in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
results of edc operations during  and we have recorded net operating losses from our edc operations of million  million and million 
during these years  our revenue has grown from  in to million in to million in our low level and slow growth of revenue are due to our low level of backlog  the slow growth of the edc market  and the slow conversion of our backlog into revenue 
during these three years our operating expenses have continued to increase from million in  to million in and to million in our personnel costs  which have represented approximately to of our operating expenses  have increased from million in  to million in and to million in this increase in personnel costs is a result of the growth in our sales  operations and software development staffs 
we believe these increases in staff are necessary in order to continue to enhance our software offering  grow backlog and convert backlog into revenue 
at december  we had approximately employees 

table of contents at our current levels of revenue and conversion of backlog into revenue  we anticipate that our operating loss will be reduced during however  we anticipate that we will still record a net operating loss for the year ended december  the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
results for include only the results of our edc operations 
year ended december  revenue direct costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the low level of growth was due to the slower than expected development and conversion of our backlog into revenue during during the second half of  we began reorganizing our sales force and are continuing to increase our sales and marketing staff in order to attract new business and grow backlog 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were million and million during the years ended december  and our gross profit was  and  during and the increase in direct costs was mainly the result of increased personnel costs of  from the addition of new employees 
the increase in personnel costs was partially offset by an  decrease in other direct costs  mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses increased by to million from million for the years ended december  and the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of million caused by an increase in sales and marketing and software development personnel 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase was the result of depreciating capital expenditures associated with the development of our information technology infrastructure 
other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december   due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs  and decreasing interest rates on our short term investments 
for the year ended december   there was a  decrease in foreign currency transaction adjustments compared to the year ended december  
table of contents due to our loss for the year ended december   no income tax expense was recorded 
at december  we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  for united states income tax purposes  which will expire through the year we also had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  for german income tax purposes  with no expiration date 
we have fully provided for our deferred tax assets through a valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million  compared to  for the year ended december  of this increase   is from customers with which we established relationships in and the remainder of the increase results from contracts with new customers 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were million and  during the years ended december  and our gross profit was  and  during and the increase in direct costs was mainly the result of increased personnel costs of  from the addition of new employees 
the remaining increase was due to additional contract costs related to the increased usage of the datatrak edc software 
during  we completed an analysis of employee and other costs relating to research and development activities 
such research and development costs for  totaling  were reclassified from direct costs to sg a expenses to conform to the reporting presentation 
sg a expenses increased by to million from million for the years ended december  and the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of  included in the  increase in personnel costs is a one time  non cash charge of  for compensation expense on stock options 
these stock options have exercise prices below the market value of our common shares on the date the stock option plan relating to these stock options was approved by our shareholders 
other sg a costs associated with our development and marketing efforts increased by  a one time expense of  associated with services to assess the market potential of the datatrak edc software is in included in sg a 
the absence of this expense was offset by  of additional consulting costs in depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  the increase was the result of depreciating capital expenditures associated with the development of our information technology infrastructure 
other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to million for the year ended december  during  million was received as the result of a favorable outcome in a lawsuit 
other income also includes interest income which decreased  in  compared to the year ended december   due to the our use of cash to fund our repurchase of common shares in august  operating losses and other working capital needs 
due to our loss for the year ended december   no income tax expense was recorded 
clinical business results of operations from january  to april   we recorded operating results related to our clinical business 
during this time period  the clinical business had revenue of million 
direct costs  sg a and depreciation expenses totaled million resulting in income from operations of  our april  sale of the clinical business resulted in a gain of million 
we incurred income tax expense of  for the year ended december  as a result of federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes incurred related to the gain associated with the sale of the clinical business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
the sale of our clinical business generated million in cash and we also received million in cash during from a favorable legal settlement 
our investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures and net purchases of short term investments 
in  we repurchased million of our common shares at a cost of million 
on january   we raised approximately million in cash with the completion of our private placement 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received upon completion of negotiated performance milestones throughout the life of the contract 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  deferred revenue was  at december  and  at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased  during the year ended december  this was the result of million provided by investing activities  and million used by operating and financing activities 
investing activities included net proceeds of million from purchases and maturities of short term investments offset by  used to purchase property and equipment 
a capital lease obligation of  entered into during the year ended december   is excluded from financing and investing activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
a total of  including interest  was paid under the capital lease obligation during cash used for operating activities resulted from the funding of net operating losses and other working capital needs 
at december   we had working capital of million  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
our working capital has decreased by million since december  the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and a  decrease in accounts and other receivables 
we are responsible for funding the enhancement and testing of the datatrak edc software 
we will continue to invest in the development of the datatrak process 
our operations and the edc market are still in a developmental stage 
we have experienced marginal revenue growth  however  we anticipate negative cash flow from operations during as we continue to build our operational and business development infrastructure 
we anticipate capital and related expenditures of approximately million for the twelve months ending december  for the continued commercialization and enhancement of datatrak edc  which we expect to fund from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations 
we believe that  with the cash raised in our january private placement  our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through december  however  we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may need to raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations inflation to date  we believe that the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of our revenue was earned in germany by our subsidiary  datatrak gmbh 
we manage our risk to foreign currency exchange rates by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
on january   we began transacting business in germany using euros 
the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we anticipate will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements 
in addition  words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions and risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
we have identified the following important factors  which could cause our actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
under no 
table of contents circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to these forward looking statements to take into account events or circumstances that occur after the date of this annual report on form k 
in addition  we do not undertake any responsibility to update publicly the occurrence of unanticipated events  which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
we have a limited operating history and we have not had profitable operations 
we began providing edc services in and have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our performance 
we have recognized operating losses in each year since our cumulative operating loss since from edc operations totaled million at december   and we may not be profitable during future periods 
if we do not continue to enhance our software  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers 
although the datatrak edc software has been used in clinical trials  its continued enhancement is necessary to provide additional functionality and services to meet the ever changing needs and expectations of our customers 
among the enhancements we have added to our software are features including electronic signatures  single user login for added security and multiple user access 
to date we have had little edc revenue from which to support the costs of this continued software enhancement 
our potential future revenue  may not be sufficient to absorb corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak process 
our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
we are subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including our success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which we participate  the timing of clinical trial sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors  which could cause our revenue predictions to be incorrect 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
we may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of our relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition 
volatility in our quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
our business strategies are unproven and we are in an early stage of development 
our efforts to establish a standardized edc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of clinical trial sponsors 
the long term viability of our business remains unproven 
our strategy may not gain acceptance among sponsors of clinical research  research sites or investigators 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may lose revenues if we experience delays in clinical trials or if we lose contracts 
although our contracts provide that we are entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  our customers generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or our contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
clinical trial sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
because of our low level of backlog 
table of contents and revenue  we may lose revenues if a clinical trial sponsor decides to delay or terminate a trial in which we participate 
we may lose revenues if any of our customers decrease their research and development expenditures  or if we lose any of our major customers 
our primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
our business depends on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
during and  quintiles  inc accounted for and of our revenue  and aventis pharmaceuticals  inc accounted for and of our revenue 
furthermore  during  control delivery systems  inc and cv therapeutics  inc 
accounted for and of our revenue 
the extent to which we rely on revenue from one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  our ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials and other factors 
in light of our small revenue base  we are more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the edc industry 
our operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn or consolidations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in their research and development expenditures or a change in the regulatory environment in which these companies operate 
changes in government regulations relating to the health care industry could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
demand for our services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
none of the proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines and rules related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the datatrak process can be kept in compliance with these guidelines and rules as they develop 
any release of fda guidance that is significantly inconsistent with the design of datatrak edc may cause us to incur substantial costs to remain in compliance with fda guidance and regulations 
we may not be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to compete in the edc market 
the edc market  which is still developing  and must compete with the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  is highly fragmented 
the major competitors  in the edc market  include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
any current and potential future competitors have or may have substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged  thereby gaining market share or product acceptance to our detriment 
we may subject to liability for potential breaches of contracts or losses relating to the unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our services are supported by telecommunications equipment  software  operating protocols and proprietary applications for high speed transmission of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
in addition  clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research requires the review and handling of large amounts of patient data 
potential liability may arise from a breach of contract or a loss of or unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our financial position could be materially adversely affected if we were forced to undertake the defense of  or were found financially responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks 
we maintain a million errors and omissions professional liability insurance policy to cover 
table of contents claims that may be brought against us 
this coverage may not be adequate  or continue to be available to us  in the future 
we have provisions that may prevent a third party acquisition and allow us to issue preferred shares 
our articles of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage a third party from acquiring  or attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for our common shares 
in addition  our board of directors  without shareholder approval  can issue preferred shares whether under our shareholder rights plan or for other uses as determined by our board 
the issuance of preferred shares may adversely affect the rights of common shareholders  the market price of our common shares and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common shares 
at the present time  we do not plan to issue any preferred shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through long and short term investments and have business transactions in german deutschmarks 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december   would have resulted in an  change in our interest income during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of our revenue was earned in germany by our subsidiary  datatrak gmbh 
we manage our risk to foreign currency exchange rates by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transacts business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between united states dollars and german deutschmarks at december   would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet and had a negligible effect on our net income 
on january   we began transacting business in germany using euros 
the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
