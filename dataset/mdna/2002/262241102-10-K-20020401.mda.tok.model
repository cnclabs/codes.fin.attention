strategic agreements rite aid rite aid and drugstore 
com continue to jointly promote rite aid 
com  powered by drugstore 
com 
in store signage and banners have been installed and displayed in approximately  rite aid stores nationwide  touting the benefits of ordering prescription refills online through a rite aid branded version of the drugstore 
com web store 
all customer orders are processed through our web store and can be either shipped to the customer or  in the case of refills of existing drugstore 
com or rite aid prescriptions  picked up by the customer at any rite aid store in the united states 
if ordered on our web site  orders are either billed to the customer s credit card or  in the case of prescriptions covered by insurance  billed to third parties 
sales of pharmaceutical products covered by third parties are recorded at the net amount to be received 
generally  we collect cash from credit card sales in two to five days from the date the order is shipped 
amounts billed to third parties are  on average  collected in approximately days after the date on which the order is shipped  however  such timing can vary depending on the payor 
sales billed to third party insurance companies and pbms through our relationship with rite aid currently represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales 
we expect that sales billed to these third parties will continue to represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales for the foreseeable future 
in  of our net sales to customers was generated through our agreement with rite aid 
if  for any reason  rite aid were unable to perform at its current levels  our future operating results could be materially impacted 
in accordance with our agreement with rite aid  we are obligated to purchase all of our pharmaceutical inventory from rite aid unless we are able to obtain better overall terms from another vendor 
currently  we purchase nearly all of our pharmaceutical inventory from rite aid  leveraging their volume requirements to obtain favorable pricing and credit terms 
thus far  we have not been able to obtain pricing on overall terms that are more favorable than those we are able to obtain through our rite aid relationship 
if rite aid were unable to supply our inventory  there are other suppliers in the marketplace that could provide us with the inventory we need 
if we were unable to obtain terms equivalent to the terms we are receiving through rite aid or if we were not able to make the transition to a new supplier in a timely manner  our operations could be adversely impacted either because we would not be able to process orders for pharmaceutical products  which would have a negative impact on the customer experience  or because our margins on pharmaceutical sales may decrease 
in addition  the agreement with rite aid also contains provisions providing for the licensing by rite aid to drugstore 
com of information technology systems and the integration of the information technology and pharmacy systems of the two companies 
we currently use these systems to process pharmaceutical orders through our distribution center 
if we were no longer able to use them  it could take us a significant amount of time and effort to replace these systems and would have a material adverse impact on our business

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of product shipped to customers  and related shipping fees  are recognized upon shipment 
revenues from sales of certain pharmaceutical products ordered through our web store for delivery at a rite aid store are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
we utilize rite aid as a fulfillment partner for the pharmaceutical products that are picked up in a rite aid store 
we record these revenues on a gross basis  since we believe we act as a principal because we bear credit and inventory risk 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an excess and obsolescence reserve for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we are using a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of the slow moving inventory including reducing sales prices on our web site  negotiating returns to vendors and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand and our assumptions about market conditions prove to be inaccurate  we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of sales and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  any significant unanticipated changes in either of these things could have a significant impact of the value of our inventory 
long lived assets in  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain long lived asset  including assets associated with access to insurance coverage  vendor agreements  cigna and wellpoint 
the impairment charge was calculated using our best estimate of future forecasted cash flows from the respective assets and a 
table of contents discount rate inherent with our cost of capital 
the nature of this analysis requires significant management judgment about our future operating results  including revenues  margins  operating expenses and applicable discount rate 
if we had used different assumptions and estimates regarding our future operating results or discount rate  the impairment charge might have been materially different 
however  we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and represent our most likely future operating results based upon the current information available 
we will continue to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in circumstances where impairment is determined to exist  we will write down the asset to its fair market value 
results of operations we have incurred net losses of million from inception to december  we believe that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next two years and possibly longer 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as e commerce 
in view of our limited operating history and the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
net sales fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands net sales new customers orders from repeat customers as a percentage of total orders of net sales from pharmaceutical products net sales includes gross revenues from sales of product and related shipping fees  net of discounts and provision for sales returns  third party reimbursement and other allowances 
discounts and coupons are routinely offered to customers as incentives to attract and retain customers 
to date  promotional discounts and coupons have only been used by customers to offset the price of non pharmaceutical products 
in addition  if a customer is not satisfied with a particular product or the level of customer service we provide  we generally refund all or a portion of the sale 
allowances for refunds and sales price incentives  including discounts and coupons  are netted against the related sales price in net sales 
sales returns and allowances have not been significant to date 
in the future  we may expand or increase the coupons and discounts we offer to our customers 
net sales also include consignment service fees earned under arrangements in which we do not take title to the inventory and cannot establish pricing 
consignment service fees earned have not been significant to date 
our net sales in both the pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical categories increased during compared to due to higher average net sales per order  which increased from in to in this increase is attributable to higher average sales price per item  an increase in the number of items per order and changes in the mix of products merchandised in our web store  including specialty and seasonal products as 
table of contents well as prestige beauty products 
the increase in basket size was offset by a decrease in the number of orders compared to the decrease in orders and new customers in compared to was primarily due to our efforts being refocused on acquiring high value customers that are more interested in quality and convenience than discount pricing 
our customer base has grown to approximately million customers in  up from million customers in  and orders from repeat customers continue to increase as we add high value customers who continue to shop at our web store 
net sales also increased during compared to due to increases in new customers  repeat orders and higher net sales per order and because was the first full year of operations of our web site 
we currently expect that net sales for fiscal year will be approximately million  of which we anticipate to come from pharmaceutical sales 
we expect to acquire between  and  new customers  and we expect that the percentage of orders from repeat customers will be approximately of our total orders 
the level of our net sales that we actually achieve will depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following the number of customers we are able to acquire and retain  the frequency of our customers purchases  the quantity and mix of products our customers purchase  the quantity of the types of products we are able to offer for sale  the price we charge for our products  the amount we charge for shipping  the extent of sales price incentives  including coupons and discounts that we offer  the extent of reimbursement available from third party payors  the level of customer returns we experience  and the seasonality that we may experience in our business 
cost of sales fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands cost of sales percentage of net sales cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold to our customers  including allowances for shrinkage and slow moving and expired inventory  as well as outbound and inbound shipping costs 
additionally  expenses related to promotional inventory included in shipments to customers are included in cost of sales 
payments that we receive from vendors in connection with joint merchandising activities  net of related costs  are netted against cost of sales in the period in which the activities take place 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased during and as a result of fewer sales incentives offered to customers  including promotional inventory  coupons and discounts and improved shipping margins 
in addition  we continue to experience a more favorable mix of product sales that includes specialty and seasonal merchandise as well as our prestige beauty line sold through beauty 
com  which we acquired in although we continue to offer promotional merchandise as a strategy to attract new customers  such amounts have decreased over time as a percentage of net sales 
our shipping costs continue to exceed the amount we charge customers  however  the amount we subsidize decreased significantly in both and we expect to continue to subsidize a portion of our shipping costs for the foreseeable future as a strategy to attract and retain customers  although we expect this subsidy to continue to decrease 

table of contents we expect cost of sales to increase in absolute dollars to the extent that our sales volume increases 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is expected to be approximately in fiscal year  however  the actual cost of sales we achieve will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following the cost of our products  including the promotional allowances  payments for joint merchandising activities and purchase volume discounts that we are able to obtain from suppliers  our pricing strategy relative to the cost of our products  including the extent to which we offer promotional merchandise  coupons or discounts  the mix of products our customers purchase  the mix of consignment service fees versus product sales  the mix of cash payments versus insurance reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products  our shipping pricing strategy relative to the cost of shipping  and the extent to which we are able to control product damage  shrinkage and expiration through inventory management practices 
fulfillment and order processing fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands fulfillment and order processing percentage of net sales fulfillment and order processing expenses include expenses related to distribution center equipment and packaging supplies  per unit fulfillment fees charged by third parties  bad debt expense  credit card processing fees  and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service  purchasing  and distribution and fulfillment activities  including pharmacists engaged in prescription verification activities and warehouse personnel 
these expenses also include rent expense and depreciation related to the company s distribution center 
fulfillment and order processing expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales during primarily as a result of a decrease in variable labor costs due to the efficiencies gained in the operations of the distribution center 
the decrease in as a percentage of net sales was the result of efficiencies gained through higher volumes of sales and in operating our own distribution center 
we expect that fulfillment and order processing expenses in will decrease as a percentage of net sales by approximately three to four percentage points compared to as we continue to improve our operational efficiency 
marketing and sales fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands marketing and sales percentage of net sales marketing and sales expenses include advertising and marketing expenses  promotional expenditures and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and merchandising activities 
advertising expenses include various advertising contracts  including the amortization of our marketing agreement with amazon 
com totaling million in and million in during fiscal year  marketing expenses also included media  agency and production costs associated with our branding campaign 

table of contents marketing and sales expenses decreased during primarily due to the decrease in television and radio advertising  promotional activities and agency and production costs 
marketing and sales expense per new customers has also decreased significantly to in from in marketing and sales increased during due to increases in headcount and related expenses as well as increased media  agency and production costs associated with our branding campaign during the first half of fiscal year additionally in fiscal year  we acquired and began promoting beauty 
com  and we incurred additional expenses associated with our portal advertising agreement with amazon 
com 
we expect that marketing and sales expenses will decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year as we continue to refine our marketing approach by targeting specific lifestyles and matching demographics and psychographics to our best customer profiles 
we expect that marketing and sales expense per new customer to be between and for fiscal year technology and content fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands technology and content percentage of net sales technology and content expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in maintaining and making minor upgrades and enhancements to our web site and its content 
these expenses also include payroll and related expenses for information technology personnel  internet access and hosting charges and web site content and design expenses 
technology and content expenses decreased in primarily due to the reduction in headcount and related expenses 
technology and content expenses increased in  primarily due to increased expenses associated with the depreciation of web servers and other equipment  the addition of information technology personnel and the additional use of consultants and contract labor 
such personnel assisted in maintaining and making minor upgrades and enhancements to our web store as well as maintaining the systems supporting the web site 
we expect that technology and content expenses will remain relatively flat in absolute dollars during fiscal year general and administrative fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands general and administrative percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  corporate facility expenses  professional services expenses  travel and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased in primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs  reduced rent expense and lower depreciation expense 
the increase in was the result of increased expenses associated with the addition of general and administrative personnel  additional professional fees and the cost of corporate facilities  including those associated with beauty 
com  which we acquired in february 
table of contents we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars during fiscal year impairment and restructuring charges fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in thousands impairment and restructuring charges percentage of net sales in january  the board of directors approved a restructuring plan whereby we terminated approximately employees 
as a result of the terminations  we decided to consolidate certain of our corporate facilities and have attempted to sublease or exit the leases associated with the excess facilities 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million which includes the forfeiture of a portion of our lease deposit associated with the cancellation of our lease for new office space  exiting leases associated with vacated facilities and the writeoff of related leasehold improvements and equipment 
as of december   our current liabilities include million associated with exiting leases associated with vacated facilities 
in  we identified impairment indicators of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our intangible assets and long term marketing contracts 
these indicators included  but were not limited to  revisions in our long term financial plan  our book value compared to our market capitalization  a deterioration of economic and market conditions and substantially lower expectations of projected future operating results related to certain significant intangible assets resulting from agreements with rite aid and gnc 
consequently  we performed an analysis of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
this analysis determined that an impairment may exist in certain of these assets 
the fair market value of the impaired assets was determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
the primary component of the impairment charge was a write down of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the rite aid and gnc strategic agreements that were executed in amortization of intangible assets fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense associated with the assets received in connection with agreements with rite aid and with gnc  including access to insurance coverage and a vendor agreement  assets acquired in connection with the purchase of beauty 
com  including goodwill and domain names  and other intangible assets  including a technology license agreement  domain names and trademarks 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in as the result of the impairment charge for the intangible assets recorded in connection with the rite aid  gnc and wellpoint strategic agreements 
amortization of intangible assets increased in due to the acquisition of these same intangible assets acquired in connection with the rite aid and gnc agreements as well as the amortization of the goodwill  domain names and other intangible assets acquired in the beauty 
com acquisition in february we expect that amortization of intangible assets will decrease significantly in due to the write down of our intangible assets in and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

amortization of stock based compensation fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands amortization of stock based compensation percentage of net sales we record deferred stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted and restricted stock issued to our employees 
the deferred stock based compensation amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
in the case of restricted stock  the deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the purchase price of the restricted stock and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of purchase 
such amounts are amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the applicable agreements using the multiple option approach 
the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
in january  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved a grant of stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock to certain of our existing employees at an exercise price of per share  which was below the fair market value on the date of the grants 
the options were granted under our stock plan and will vest over a four year period  with of the total number of shares subject to the options vesting on june  and the remaining shares vesting in equal installments at the end of each quarter thereafter 
accordingly  we expect to record deferred stock based compensation of approximately million  which will be amortized over the vesting period of the options using the multiple option approach 
deferred stock based compensation for stock options and restricted stock issued to our employees will be subsequently recognized as expense  subject to continuing employment  for each of the next four fiscal years as follows fiscal year amount in thousands interest income and expense fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands interest income  net interest income consists of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and interest expense consists of interest associated with capital lease obligations 
net interest income decreased during as a result of our decreasing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as decreases in interest rates during the year 
the increase in net interest income during was the result of a higher average outstanding cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances associated with our equity financings 
we expect net interest income to decrease in fiscal year as our average outstanding balance of cash  cash 
table of contents equivalents and marketable securities is reduced over time 
extraordinary gain on renegotiation of equity guarantee under the terms of the agreement we entered into with wellpoint in june  we issued to wellpoint  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million 
if the  shares of common stock issued to wellpoint did not have a fair market value of million at the end of two years  we were required to pay wellpoint  in common stock or cash  the difference between million and the fair market value of the common stock 
in the third quarter of  we amended our agreement with wellpoint to reduce the guaranteed value of our stock issued to wellpoint from million to million

if the  shares of common stock issued to wellpoint did not have a fair market value of million at the end of two years  we were required to pay wellpoint  in common stock or cash  the difference between million and the then fair market value of the common stock 
based on the terms of that agreement  eitf requires that the transaction be recorded at fair value each quarter 
accordingly  at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  which is the effective date of eitf  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle of million which represents the difference between the fair value of the guarantee as of july   and the fair value of the guarantee on the original date of the agreement 
during the third quarter of  we amended the agreement with wellpoint which changed the terms of settlement  as a result of which we are no longer required to record changes in the fair value of the guarantee each quarter

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas  each effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under sfas  pooling of interest is no longer an acceptable method of accounting for business combinations 
sfas also develops further criteria for recognizing intangible assets separate from goodwill in a purchase transaction 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
under sfas  goodwill will no longer be amortized over its expected useful life  but will instead be assessed for impairment on an annual basis 
separately identifiable intangible assets that do not have an indefinite useful life will continue to be amortized 
we recorded goodwill in conjunction with our acquisition of beauty 
com that was amortized through december  at which time  amortization ceased 
we expect a reduction of million and million in amortization expense during fiscal years and  respectively  due to the implementation of sfas as required by sfas  we will perform an impairment analysis on our beauty

we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of million from inception to december  we believe that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
from our inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including common and preferred stock  yielding net cash proceeds of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for each of these periods primarily reflects our net losses offset by changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities during was million and primarily reflects net purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities during was million and was related to the sales of marketable securities outstanding as of december   net of capital expenditures attributable to establishing our own distribution center 
net cash used in investing activities during was million and was primarily related to the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering in marketable securities with an original maturity greater than days 
additionally  net cash used in investing activities for all periods presented includes leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
net cash used in financing activities during was million  consisting primarily of principal payments on capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities during and was million and million  respectively 
during  net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of cash proceeds from our secondary public offering consummated in march  which yielded net cash proceeds of million  and our private placement of common and preferred stock in august  which yielded net cash proceeds of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million  and our marketable securities balance was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
combined cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases and strategic agreements with amazon

table of contents on june   we may also be required to pay wellpoint the difference between the million guarantee and the fair market value of  shares our common stock  in cash or common stock  at our option if the fair market value does not exceed the million guarantee 
we expect to use approximately million to million of cash during fiscal year  however  cash use may vary materially if we do not achieve our operating goals 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations until we begin generating operating cash flow 
although we currently expect to begin generating operating cash flow in  there can be no assurances as to such timing or that we will ever generate operating cash flow 
we currently do not have any additional borrowing facilities and may need to raise additional funds if  for example  we pursue business or technology acquisitions or experience operating losses that exceed our current expectations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
factors that may affect our business an investment in our securities involves certain risks 
in evaluating us and our business  investors should give careful consideration to the factors listed below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we are an early stage company in a new and rapidly evolving market  which makes it difficult for investors to determine whether we will accomplish our objectives because drugstore 
com was founded in april and we only began selling products in february  we have a limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business strategy 
we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
an investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies as well as the risks we face due to our participation in a new and rapidly evolving market 
these challenges include our need to increase our brand awareness  need to attract and retain customers at a reasonable cost  need to achieve a critical mass of customers  need to improve our gross margin and fulfillment cost  dependence on web site and transaction processing performance and reliability  need to compete effectively  need to establish ourselves as an important participant in the evolving market for healthcare products and services on the internet  and need to establish and develop relationships in the healthcare industry  particularly in the areas of reimbursement and managed care 
consumers of health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products may not accept our solution  which would harm our revenues and prevent us from becoming profitable if we do not attract and retain a high volume of online customers to our store at a reasonable cost  we will not be able to increase our revenues or achieve profitability 
we may not be able to convert a large number of 
table of contents customers from traditional shopping methods to online shopping for health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products 
specific factors that could prevent widespread customer acceptance include shipping charges  which do not apply to shopping at traditional drugstores  delivery time associated with internet orders  as compared to the immediate receipt of products at a physical store  pricing that does not meet customer expectations of finding the lowest price on the internet  additional steps and delays in ensuring insurance coverage for prescription products  lack of coverage of customer prescriptions by some insurance carriers  lack of consumer awareness of our online pharmacy  customer concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of their personal health information  product damage from shipping or shipments of wrong or expired products from us or other vendors  resulting in a failure to establish customers trust in buying drugstore items online  delays in responses to customer inquiries or in deliveries to customers  inability to serve the acute care needs of customers  including emergency prescription drugs and other urgently needed products  and difficulties in returning or exchanging orders 
we expect continuing losses for the next several years we incurred net losses of million for the period from inception through december  we have not achieved profitability 
we only began selling products in february and cannot be certain that we will obtain enough customer traffic or a high enough volume of purchases to generate sufficient revenues and achieve profitability 
we believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses for at least the next two years and possibly longer as we fulfill more customer orders as the volume of purchases increases  increase our sales and marketing activities  provide our customers with promotional benefits  such as selling selected products or offering shipping below our actual costs  increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations  and develop enhanced technologies  features and fulfillment processes to improve our web site 
we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate  which would further increase our losses 
we may not succeed in establishing the drugstore 
com brand  which would adversely affect customer acceptance and our revenues due to the early stage and competitive nature of the online market for drugstore products  if we do not establish our brand quickly  we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers 
promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide consistent  high quality customer experiences 
to promote our brand  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expense in our advertising efforts 
if these brand promotion activities do not yield increased revenues  we will incur additional losses 
even if our efforts are successful  adverse publicity about our strategic partners could damage our brand and negatively affect customer acceptance of our site 

table of contents we expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate and our early stage of development limits our ability to predict revenues and expenses precisely historical trends and quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
our revenues and operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our products  our ability to attract visitors to our web store and convert those visitors into customers  the frequency and size of customer orders  changes in the growth rate of internet usage  average order size  the quantity and mix of products our customers purchase  the price we charge for our products  the amount we charge for shipping  the extent of promotional benefits  such as discounts and incentives  we may offer on products and shipping  the level of customer returns we experience  our ability to enhance our technology to accommodate any future growth in our operations or customers  our ability to manage inventory levels and ensure sufficient product supply  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  changes in government regulation  the extent of reimbursements available from third party payors  effectiveness of our marketing efforts  costs related to potential acquisitions of technology or businesses  and current economic conditions and world events 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for any reason could result in substantial additional operating losses 
the volume and timing of orders of health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products on our web store are difficult to predict because the online market for such products is in its early stages 
due to the limited operating history of our web store  we may have difficulty forecasting revenue from customers or overall anticipated revenue trends 
a portion of our revenues may also be seasonal in nature  especially with respect to the sale of certain health and beauty products that depend to some extent on seasonal product changes and seasonal purchasing patterns 
consumer fads and other changes in consumer trends may cause shifts in purchasing patterns  resulting in significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to fully assess the impact of these factors 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain insurance reimbursement coverage for our customers  our ability to sell pharmacy products online could decrease  which would harm our revenues to obtain reimbursement on behalf of our customers for the prescription products that they purchase on our web site  we must maintain relationships with insurance companies and pbms  either directly or through our relationship with rite aid 
we currently rely primarily on rite aid s relationships with insurance companies and pbms and the extension of these relationships to cover prescriptions processed by us 
sales billed through rite aid s relationships currently represent a significant percentage of our pharmacy sales 
we have also entered into direct relationships with pbms and insurers  including wellpoint 
if we are unable to maintain and leverage our direct relationships  and to the extent rite aid is unable to maintain its relationships  or if these relationships do not extend to cover the prescriptions we process  our ability to obtain reimbursement coverage for our customers would be reduced 
this would reduce the number of customers that fill prescriptions through our web site  which would reduce our revenues 
our ability to enter into direct relationships with insurance companies and pbms or retain our existing relationships for an extended period of time is uncertain for the following reasons many of these companies are in the early stages of evaluating the impact of the internet and online pharmacies on their businesses 
these companies may delay their decisions to contract with online pharmacies or may decide to develop their own internet capabilities that may compete with us  many insurance companies have existing contracts with chain drugstores and pbms that have announced their intentions to establish online pharmacies  and some insurance companies and pbms will likely contract with only one or a limited number of online pharmacies 
if our online competitors obtain these contracts and we do not  we would be at a competitive disadvantage 
many of our agreements with insurance companies and pbms are short term  may be terminated with less than days prior notice and are subject to amendment by such insurance companies and pbms 
our contract with pcs is a year agreement that could terminate earlier if our agreement with rite aid is terminated 
our contract with wellpoint is a year agreement that could terminate earlier if we experience a change of control 
in addition  we must process each insurance application individually  which may raise the costs of processing prescription orders and delay our order processing time 
customers may not embrace our online insurance coverage procedure 
we depend on a limited number of distribution partners  if they do not perform  we will not be able to effectively ship orders we are obligated to purchase all of our pharmaceutical products from rite aid unless we are able to obtain better overall terms from another vendor 
our business could be significantly disrupted if rite aid was to breach its contract or suffer adverse developments that affect its ability to supply products to us 
if for any reason rite aid is unable or unwilling to supply products to us in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner  we may not be able to secure alternative fulfillment partners on acceptable terms in a timely manner  or at all 
for a discussion of certain potentially adverse developments at rite aid  see our relationship with rite aid involves many risks and may restrict our ability to promote  contract with or operate traditional retail stores 
we also rely on third party carriers for shipments to and from distribution facilities and to customers 
we are therefore subject to the risks  including security concerns  employee strikes and inclement weather  associated with our carriers ability to provide product fulfillment and delivery services to meet our distribution and shipping needs 
failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner would harm our reputation  the drugstore 
com brand and our results of operations 

table of contents operating our own distribution center requires significant investments in management resources prior to june  we relied primarily on third parties to fulfill our orders 
in january  we began operating our own  square foot distribution center to achieve greater control over the distribution process and to ensure adequate supplies of products to our customers 
as of june  all of our orders delivered by mail are processed from our distribution center 
if we do not successfully operate our distribution center to accommodate peak volumes or if the distribution center fails to operate properly  it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand 
operating our distribution center requires that we effectively manage our product purchasing function and our inventory levels to avoid product shortages  excess inventory and markdowns due to unpopular or expired inventory  and control product damage and shrinkage through effective security measures and inventory management practices 
we have limited experience processing customer order fulfillment through our distribution center and managing significant levels of inventory  and issues arising with respect to the operation of our distribution center could divert management attention from other aspects of our business 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain products on favorable terms 
in connection with the opening of our distribution center  we also expanded our pharmacy operations through our arrangement with rite aid which supplies us with most of our pharmaceutical products 
our pharmacy operations subject us to additional regulatory requirements and related costs 
we believe that our distribution center will provide us with sufficient distribution capacity for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to increase our distribution capacity sooner than anticipated  and any further expansion would require additional financing that may not be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
any errors in the filling or packaging of the prescription drugs we dispense may expose us to liability and negative publicity pharmacy errors relating to prescriptions  dosage and other aspects of the medication dispensing process can produce liability for us that our insurance may not cover 
because we distribute pharmaceutical products directly to the consumer  we are the most visible participant in the medication distribution chain and therefore have more exposure to liability claims 
our pharmacists are required by law to offer counseling  without additional charge  to our customers about medication  dosage  delivery systems  common side effects and other information deemed significant by the pharmacists 
our pharmacists may have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential adverse effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate such effects 
this counseling is in part accomplished through e mail and inserts included with the prescription  which may increase the risk of miscommunication because the customer is not personally present or may not have provided all relevant information 
we also post product information on our web site 
providing information on pharmaceutical and other products creates the potential for claims to be made against us for negligence  personal injury  wrongful death  product liability  malpractice  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on our product or service offerings 
our general liability  product liability and professional liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
pharmacy errors by either drugstore 
com or our competitors may also produce significant adverse publicity either for us or for the entire online pharmacy industry 
because of the significant amount of press coverage on internet retailing and online pharmacies  we believe that we will be subject to a higher level of media scrutiny 
table of contents than other pharmacy product channels 
the amount of negative publicity that we or the online pharmacy industry receive as a result of pharmacy or prescription processing errors could be disproportionate in relation to the negative publicity received by other pharmacies making similar mistakes 
we have no control over the pharmacy practices of our competitors  and we cannot ensure that our pharmacists or our prescription processing will be able to operate without error 
we believe customer acceptance of our online shopping experience is based in large part on consumer trust  and negative publicity could erode such trust or prevent it from growing 
this could result in an immediate reduction in the amount of orders we receive and adversely affect our revenue growth 
we face the risk of systems interruptions and capacity constraints on our web site  possibly resulting in adverse publicity  revenue losses and erosion of customer trust the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers and to maintain adequate customer service levels 
any future systems interruption that results in the unavailability of our web site or reduced order fulfillment performance could result in negative publicity and reduce the volume of goods sold and the attractiveness of our web store  which could negatively affect our revenues 
from time to time  we have experienced temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons  including power failures  software bugs and an overwhelming number of visitors trying to reach our web site 
we may not be able to correct any such problem in a timely manner 
because we outsource certain aspects of our system and because some of the reasons for a systems interruption may be outside of our control  we also may not be able to exercise sufficient control to remedy the problem quickly or at all 
we opened our site for customers in february  and to the extent that customer traffic grows substantially  we will need to expand the capacity of our systems to accommodate a larger number of visitors 
any inability to scale our systems may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer service  impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment or delays in reporting accurate financial information 
we are not certain that we will be able to project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our web site accurately or in a timely manner to permit us to effectively upgrade and expand our transaction processing systems or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased modules with our existing systems 
we have grown very rapidly  and we need to manage changing and expanding operations we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and anticipate that we will continue to expand 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we will not be able to implement our business strategy in a rapidly evolving market without an effective planning and management process 
we will not be able to increase revenues unless we continue to improve our transaction processing  operational  financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  to expand  train and manage our work force and to manage multiple relationships with third parties 
many of our senior management have no prior senior management experience at public companies  and none of our executive officers have prior management experience in the healthcare or retail drugstore industry 
expanding the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings is expensive and difficult  and we may receive no benefit from our expansion we intend to expand the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings by promoting new or complementary products or sales formats 
we cannot be certain that these new offerings will generate sufficient revenues for the costs involved 
expansion of our offerings in this manner could require significant additional expenditures and could strain our management  financial and operational resources 
for example  we may need to incur significant marketing expenses  develop relationships with new fulfillment partners or manufacturers or comply with new regulations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our product and service 
table of contents offerings in a cost effective or timely manner 
furthermore  any new product or service offering or sales format that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the reputation of our brand 
the lack of market acceptance of such efforts or our inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded offerings to offset their cost could harm our business 
finally  our agreement with amazon 
com contains prohibitions that limit our ability to partner with other companies to sell products and services in markets that are competitive with those offered by amazon 
com  although we are able to sell products and services in these markets ourselves 
our relationship with amazon 
com may restrict some of our activities our relationship with amazon 
com may restrict our activities and is subject to change 
we entered into a technology license and advertising agreement in august with amazon 
com 
in addition  in january we entered into a three year agreement with amazon 
com to integrate various shopping features of our web sites and create a persistent drugstore 
com shopping presence on the amazon 
com web site 
amazon 
com is currently our largest stockholder and jeffrey p 
bezos  amazon 
com s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  is a member of our board of directors 
our relationship with amazon 
com has received significant media attention  but the parties obligations to provide support to each other are limited 
pursuant to these agreements  each party has committed to providing the other with advertising on our respective web sites 
the agreement we entered into in january contains provisions restricting the percentage of total revenues we can obtain from the sale on our web site of products or services other than health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmaceutical products 
we may not assign this agreement without amazon 
com s consent 
under the technology license and advertising agreement  we are restricted from promoting on our web site any company that sells products or services competitive with those that amazon 
com offers or is preparing to produce or market 
if we were acquired by a competitor of amazon 
com and amazon 
com did not vote in favor of the transaction  we would lose our rights to advertise on amazon 
com s web site and to use amazon 
com s technology if we are then using any 
in addition  we have agreed not to sell advertising on our web site to any company that sells products or services competitive with those offered by amazon 
com  although the sale of advertising on our web site is not presently  and is not expected to be  part of our business strategy 
in addition  due to amazon 
com s significant ownership of our common stock  it will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
our relationship with rite aid involves many risks and may restrict our ability to promote  contract with  or operate traditional retail stores in june  we entered into a series of agreements with rite aid 
these agreements involve many aspects of our businesses and the operation of our respective web sites  the fulfillment of orders and the extension of rite aid s insurance relationships to cover prescriptions processed by us 
this type of arrangement is complex and requires a great deal of effort to operate successfully 
as a result  there are many risks related to these arrangements  including some that we may not have foreseen 
it is difficult to assess the likelihood of occurrence of these risks  including the lack of success of the overall arrangement to meet the parties objectives 
in the event that we do not realize the intended benefits of these relationships  we will have expended a great deal of time and effort that could have been directed to more beneficial activities 
in addition  customer perceptions and our business may be adversely impacted if these relationships are not successful 
while rite aid has committed to promoting drugstore 
com in its stores and in its advertising  we do not control the choice of ads that will feature us  and this form of advertising may not result in additional drugstore 
com customers 
while the rite aid relationship substantially broadens our ability to provide prescription medications to consumers with insurance reimbursement plans  it may not allow all of our potential customers to purchase these medications from drugstore 
com and receive insurance reimbursement  which could 
table of contents adversely affect consumer perceptions and our revenues 
we have agreed not to promote any other traditional chain drugstore or operate one ourselves 
we have also agreed not to contract with another traditional retail store to fill pharmacy product orders we receive unless a rite aid store is not conveniently located nearby 
these restrictions could limit our flexibility and ability to grow our business if our relationship with rite aid does not develop successfully 
rite aid has received significant negative publicity regarding its financial situation following its announcements regarding the restructuring and extension of its banking facilities  including amendments to financial covenants  the planned restatements of its  and financial statements and the resignation of its independent auditors in november rite aid has since engaged new auditors and made significant changes to its senior management team 
our relationship with rite aid is important to us  particularly in our pharmacy fulfillment operations and in our ability to offer insurance reimbursement coverage to our customers 
if rite aid s financial condition were to worsen  rite aid may be unable to continue to fulfill its obligations to us under our agreements  and this would have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  negative publicity regarding rite aid could negatively affect the drugstore 
com brand and our stock price 
our relationship with pcs was established at the same time as  and in connection with  our relationship with rite aid 
rite aid sold pcs healthcare systems to advanced paradigm 
advanced paradigm may not demonstrate the same level of commitment to our relationship with pcs healthcare systems as rite aid 
rite aid currently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  rite aid is able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we are dependent on our strategic relationships to help promote our web site and expand our product offerings  if we fail to maintain or enhance these relationships  our development could be hindered we believe that our strategic relationships with amazon 
com  rite aid  pcs and gnc as well as portals and third party distributors are critical to attract customers  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products and the drugstore 
com brand and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to develop or maintain key relationships  our ability to attract customers would suffer and our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of our strategic partners 
our business could be harmed if any of our key strategic partners were to experience financial or operational difficulties or if other corporate developments adversely affect their performance under our agreements 
we face uncertainty related to pharmaceutical costs and pricing  which could affect our revenues and profitability pharmacy sales account for a significant percentage of our total sales 
sales of our pharmacy products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations hmos  pbms and other organizations 
these organizations are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
the efforts of third party payors to contain costs will place downward pressures on profitability from sales of prescription drugs 
our revenues from prescription drug sales may also be affected by health care reform initiatives of federal and state governments  including proposals designed to significantly reduce spending on medicare  medicaid and other government programs  changes in programs providing for reimbursement for the cost of prescription drugs by third party payors and regulatory changes related to the approval process for prescription drugs 
such initiatives could lead to the enactment of federal and state regulations that may adversely impact our prescription drug sales 
one such initiative is the bush administration s proposal to introduce medicare endorsed prescription discount cards 
in addition  certain state governments have proposed prescription discount card programs to 
table of contents control the rise in drug costs 
if legislation is enacted as a result of these proposals and the resulting discounts come primarily from retail pharmacy concessions on drug prices and dispensing fees  we could be adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that our products or services will be considered cost effective or that adequate third party reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit 
competition from both traditional and online retailers may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services we compete in a market that is highly competitive and expect competition to intensify in the future 
we currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
these competitors include various online stores that sell pharmaceutical and over the counter drugs  as well as health  wellness  beauty and personal care items  mail order pharmacies  existing bricks and mortar drugstores  and specialty retailers and major department stores 
most of these competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater financial  marketing and other resources  established marketing relationships with leading manufacturers and advertisers and greater presence in distribution channels 
some of these companies may commence or expand their presence on the internet 
we also compete with hospitals  hmos and mail order prescription drug providers  all of which are or may begin offering products and services over the internet 
if we fail to attract and retain a large customer base and our competitors establish a more prominent market position relative to ours  this could inhibit our ability to grow 
we also believe we may face a significant competitive challenge from our competitors forming alliances with each other 
our direct online competitors may form partnerships with pbms  hmos or chain drugstores 
the combined resources of these partnerships could pose a significant competitive challenge to drugstore 
com 
in addition  certain pbms and hmos could form alliances with our competitors that would prevent them from also entering into relationships with drugstore 
com 
our inability to partner with a major pbm or hmo could be a major competitive disadvantage to us 
in addition  we may also begin to face competition from online pharmacies outside the united states 
legislation allowing for importation of prescription drugs by individuals for personal use was introduced into the us senate 
if enacted  this legislation could adversely affect our business since consumers may use foreign based online prescription drug web sites instead of us based online pharmacies 
we believe the principal factors that will draw end users to an online shopping application include brand availability  wide product range  personalized services  convenience  price  accessibility  customer services  quality of search tools  quality of web site content  and reliability and speed of fulfillment for products ordered 
we will have little or no control over how successful our competitors are in addressing these factors 
in addition  with little difficulty  our online competitors can duplicate many of the products  services and content offered on our site 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  fewer search queries served  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other harmful consequences if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to acquire complementary or strategic businesses  technologies  services and or products 
the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company may also require significant management resources that would otherwise be 
table of contents available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized or may depend on the continued service of acquired personnel who could choose to leave 
we currently do not have any understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions  and no material acquisitions are currently being pursued 
future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
our systems and operations  and those of our distributors  are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected problems substantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located at our leased facility in bellevue  washington  and our systems infrastructure is hosted at a former exodus facility in tukwila  washington 
in exodus filed for chapter bankruptcy protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
cable and wireless announced on february   that following approval from the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware it has completed the acquisition from exodus of selected assets and a majority of the business activities of exodus in the united states 
despite financial difficulties at exodus  our service has been unaffected to date  and exodus employees have indicated that our service will not be affected by the cable wireless acquisition 
if cable wireless does not show the same commitment to service as exodus has  our business may be negatively impacted 
our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  earthquakes  acts of war or terrorism and similar events 
in addition  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders 
we do not currently have redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan and do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for all losses that may occur 
our distribution facility in new jersey also faces these risks 
we depend on the efficient operation of internet connections from customers to our systems 
these connections  in turn  depend on the efficient operation of web browsers  internet service providers and internet backbone service providers  all of which have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
any system delays  failures or loss of data  whatever the cause  could reduce customer satisfaction with our applications and services and harm our sales 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
governmental regulation of our business could require significant expenses  and failure to comply with certain regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  entities engaging in the practice of pharmacy are subject to federal and state regulatory and licensing requirements 
regulations in this area often require subjective interpretation  and we cannot be certain that our attempts to comply with these regulations will be deemed sufficient by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
violations of any regulations could result in various civil and criminal penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses or registrations  seizure of our inventory or monetary fines  which could adversely affect our operations 
we are also subject to laws and regulations regarding homeopathic drugs  and we may face enforcement actions  lawsuits or claims asserting that we have not complied with these laws and regulations 
as we expand our product and service offerings  more of our products and services will likely be subject to regulation by the fda  which regulates drug advertising and promotion 
complying with fda regulations is time consuming  burdensome and expensive and could delay our introduction of new products or services 

table of contents legislation and regulations currently being considered at the federal and state level could affect our business  including legislation or regulations relating to confidentiality of patient records and the electronic access and storage of such records  disclosure requirements for internet pharmacies and the inclusion of prescription drugs as a medicare benefit 
in addition  state legislatures may add or amend legislation related to the regulation of nonresident pharmacies 
compliance with new laws or regulations could increase our expenses 
hipaa mandates the development of standards and requirements to control the flow of health information throughout the health care system and to protect the privacy of personal health records 
the hipaa regulations have been finalized for standardization of transactions and code sets and for privacy of individually identifiable health information also known as the privacy standards rule 
covered organizations and practitioners have until october   to comply with the standardization of transactions and code sets rules and until april   to comply with the privacy standards rule 
the bush administration may revise the requirements for the privacy standards rule 
the requirements in these regulations could create financial and administrative burdens for pharmacies  including online pharmacies  and may restrict the manner in which we transmit and use information and may cause us to use additional resources 
this could lead to delays as we revise our web site and operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation relating to the confidentiality and release of patient records 
additional legislation governing distribution of medical records  confidentiality of patient records and electronic access and storage exists or has been proposed at both the state and federal level 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
moreover  we may be restricted or prevented from delivering patient records electronically 
this could have an adverse impact on our ability to gain and retain customers 
failure to attract and retain experienced personnel and senior management could hurt our ability to grow our business our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and senior management 
none of our employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
in addition  none of the members of our senior management team have prior experience in the healthcare industry or in drugstore operations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business we rely or may in the future rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property 
these afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our sales formats or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  such as the technology used to operate our web site  our web site content and our trademarks 
we have filed applications for us trademark registrations for drugstore 
com and certain other trademarks 
we may be unable to secure these registrations 
it is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt service names similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
in addition  there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term drugstore 
com or our other trademark applications 
any claims or customer confusion related to our trademarks or our failure to obtain any trademark registration could negatively affect our business 
litigation or proceedings before the us patent and trademark office may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and domain name and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or adverse priority proceeding or other efforts 
table of contents to protect our intellectual property could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business and operating results 
finally  we may in the future sell our products internationally  and the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
third parties may also claim infringement by us with respect to past  current or future technologies 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
any such claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we have licensed in the past  and expect that we may license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to third parties 
for example  as noted above  we have licensed our technology to amazon 
com  and we have also granted nonexclusive rights to our trademarks to certain entities in connection with advertising and affiliate relationships 
while we attempt to ensure that such licensees maintain the quality of the drugstore 
com products brand  we cannot assure ensure such licensees will not take actions that might hurt the value of our proprietary rights or reputation 
we may not be able to protect our domain names in all countries or against all infringers  which could decrease the value of our brand name and proprietary rights we currently hold the internet domain name drugstore 
com  as well as various other related names 
domain names generally are regulated by internet regulatory bodies 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
regulatory bodies could establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  we may not acquire or maintain the drugstore 
com domain name in all of the countries in which we conduct business 
in addition  regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
therefore  we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our brand name  trademarks and other proprietary rights 
we may face liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury  death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls 
some of our vendor agreements do not indemnify us from product liability 
further  our liability insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed as a result of such claims  and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms  or at all 
we may face liability for content on our web site because we post product information and other content on our web site  we face potential liability for negligence  copyright  patent  trademark  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we post 
such claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against internet content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business 

table of contents our officers  directors and certain existing stockholders control the majority of our common stock  which could discourage an acquisition of us or make removal of incumbent management more difficult executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
in addition  amazon 
com beneficially owns approximately and rite aid beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
therefore  amazon 
com and rite aid will each be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
amazon 
com s and rite aid s substantial equity stakes in drugstore 
com could also make us a much less attractive acquisition candidate to potential acquirors because either amazon 
com or rite aid alone could have sufficient votes to prevent the tax free treatment of an acquisition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and it is unlikely such additional financing will be available to us our available funds may not be sufficient to meet all of our long term business development requirements  and we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to take advantage of favorable business opportunities  including acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  increase brand awareness  increase our ability to attract visitors to our web store and convert those visitors into customers  develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  enhance and increase our distribution capacity  develop new product and service offerings  and respond to competitive pressures 
due to current market conditions  it is unlikely that any additional financing that we may need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to undertake any of the activities noted above may be significantly limited 
our net sales would be harmed if we experience significant credit card fraud a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm our net sales and results of operations because we do not carry insurance against this risk 
under current credit card practices  we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder s signature 
certain antitakeover provisions and significant equity ownership by amazon 
com and rite aid could preclude an acquisition provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  washington law and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
further  because amazon 
com and rite aid each own a significant percentage of our capital stock  a competitor of amazon 
com or rite aid as well as other potential acquirors could determine not to merge with or acquire us 
in addition  if we were acquired by an amazon 
com competitor and amazon 
com did not vote in favor of the transaction  we would lose our rights to promotional placements on amazon 
com s web site and to use amazon 
com s technology if we are then using any 
the potential loss of these rights could inhibit offers to acquire us 

table of contents we depend on continued use of the internet and growth of the online drugstore market our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication by our target customers 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet has occurred only recently 
as a result  acceptance and use of the internet may not continue to develop at historical rates  and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt  and continue to use  the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a viable long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
our success depends in large part  upon third parties maintaining the internet infrastructure to provide a reliable network backbone with the speed  data capacity  security and hardware necessary for reliable internet access and services 
further  the online market for drugstore products is in its infancy 
the market is significantly less developed than the online market for books  auctions  music  software and numerous other consumer products 
even if use of the internet and electronic commerce continues to increase  the rate of growth  if any  of the online drugstore market could be significantly less than the online market for other products 
our rate of revenue growth could therefore be significantly less than other online merchants 
if we are required to collect taxes in additional jurisdictions on the products we sell  we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease in accordance with current industry practice  we do not currently collect sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of goods into states other than washington 
our distribution center  any future distribution centers and other aspects of our evolving business  may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 
one or more states or the federal government may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that engage in electronic commerce as we do 
moreover  one or more states or the federal government could begin to impose sales taxes on sales of prescription products  which are not generally taxed at this time 
if so  customers who order prescriptions at our web site and pick them up at a rite aid store would be required to pay sales tax 
a successful assertion by one or more states or the federal government that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our products could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business 
federal legislation limits the imposition of us state and local taxes on internet related sales 
in  congress passed the internet tax freedom act  which placed a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access  unless such tax was already imposed prior to october   and on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce 
this act was extended until november  if congress chooses not to renew this legislation in  us state and local governments would be free to impose new taxes on electronically purchased goods 
the imposition of taxes on goods sold over the internet by us state and local governments could create administration burdens for us and decrease our future sales 
currently  decisions of the us supreme court restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet 
however  a number of states  as well as the us congress  have been considering various initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme court s decisions 
if any of these initiatives addressed the supreme court s constitutional concerns and resulted in a reversal of its current position  we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in states other than washington 
the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales 

table of contents if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our services could become obsolete and our business would be seriously harmed as the internet and online commerce industry evolve  we must license leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
we may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our web store  proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to do so  it could adversely impact our ability to build the drugstore 
com brand and attract and retain customers 
governmental regulation of the internet and data transmission over the internet could affect our business we are subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses  as well as those directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet 
these laws and regulations may deal with privacy  copyrights  taxation  content and consumer protection 
the european union has also enacted its own privacy regulations 
in particular  many government agencies and consumers are focused on the privacy and security of medical and pharmaceutical records 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing privacy  libel and taxation apply to internet stores such as ours 
the rapid growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and in particular companies that fill prescriptions or maintain medical or pharmaceutical records 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to internet businesses could adversely affect our ability to attract and serve customers 
our stock price is likely to continue to fluctuate  which could result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be extremely volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
factors that could cause our stock price to fluctuate include general economic conditions  quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements by us or our competitors concerning new products  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic relationships  publicity about our company  our products and services  our strategic partners  our competitors  the online pharmacy industry or e commerce in general  additions or departures of key personnel  any future sales of our common stock or other securities  and stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly traded companies in general and internet related companies in particular 
the trading prices of our company stock has been volatile and is significantly lower than our initial public offering price 
it is unlikely that investors will be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the initial offering price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we have been named in such stockholder class 
table of contents action suits and may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if our stock price were to fall below for a period of time  we may not be able to maintain the standards required for continued listing on the nasdaq national market nasdaq 
delisting from the nasdaq would prevent holders of our common stock from being able to easily buy or sell our common stock 
subsequent sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings in october  we granted incentive stock options to our employees to purchase shares of our common stock at per share 
as of march   million of these options were outstanding and exercisable 
on april   approximately million of these options will vest and become exercisable 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by new or existing stockholders could adversely affect prevailing market price for our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments included in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments does not pose a material risk to us 
we are exposed to risk associated with fluctuations in our stock price and its impact on the liability recorded to satisfy the million guarantee to wellpoint 
based on the terms of our agreement with wellpoint  if the  shares of stock issued to wellpoint do not have a fair market value of million in june  we are required to pay wellpoint  in stock or cash at our option  the difference between million and the fair market value of the stock 
based on the closing price of our common stock as of december   we would be required to pay million in cash or issue an additional  shares of our common stock to satisfy the million guarantee
