accordingly  actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the predictions contained herein 
results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for sales to all customers  including manufacturer representatives  distributors or their third party customers  these criteria are met at the time product is shipped 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
accounts receivable the company maintains credit limits for all customers that are developed based upon several factors  included but not limited to payment history  published credit reports and use of credit references 
on a monthly basis  management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
this review includes accounts receivable agings  other operating trends and relevant business conditions  including general economic factors  as they relate to each of the company s domestic and international customers 
if this analyses leads management to the conclusion that potential significant accounts are uncollectable  a reserve will be provided 
the company has had no significant bad debt write offs since its inception in as of may   management does not believe any significant accounts were uncollectable and therefore no reserve was considered necessary 
inventories these assets are stated at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis 
each fiscal quarter  management utilizes various analyses based on sales forecasts  historical sales and inventory levels to ensure the current carrying value of inventory accurately reflects current and expected requirements within a reasonable timeframe 
as a result of this analysis at may   management believes the inventory levels are sufficient based upon the expected requirements in fiscal and beyond 
based upon the same analysis in fiscal  management determined  of inventories were in excess of expected requirements and therefore these amounts were written off 
long term investment the long term investment in air packaging technologies  inc airp 
this investment is classified as available for sale securities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

as required under that statement  all unrealized gains and losses net of taxes are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reported as a separate component in other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity until realized or until unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary 
management reviews the investment each quarter in order to evaluate if any unrealized loss is temporary or a permanent impairment in value 
if conditions lead to the conclusion the loss appears to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the estimated fair market value with the loss included in earnings 
as of may  management believed the decline in value from historic cost was other than temporary and therefore this asset was written down to the fair market value at that date 
further write downs will be recorded if and when management determines that continued losses are other than temporary 
long term deferred tax asset the company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws

as of may   management believed the company would generate sufficient future income to utilize the net deferred tax asset 
intangible assets there is a periodic review of intangible and other long lived assets for impairment 
this review consists of the analysis of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time  to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
as of may   management did not believe an impairment  as defined above  exists 
discussion of operating results sales in fiscal decreased to  from  and  in fiscal and respectively 
worldwide sales of schmitt balancing products in fiscal decreased to  from  and  in fiscal and respectively 
measurement sales increased to  from  in fiscal but decreased slightly from  in fiscal the net loss for fiscal of  compares to a net loss of  in fiscal and net income for fiscal of  the loss in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  non operating charge for a write down of the company s long term investment in air packaging technologies  inc the loss in fiscal was primarily attributable to a write off of excess inventory in the subsidiary that designs and assembles laser light scatter products 
also contributing to the losses in fiscal and were decreasing sales  primarily in the balancer segment with the general economic slowdown in north america and europe believed to be the biggest cause 
domestic and foreign revenues in the past several months have been affected by the slowdown in the global economy  resulting in reduced demand for both balancer and measurement devices 
the balancer segment sales focus on end users  rebuilders and original equipment manufacturers throughout the world 
sales staff  representatives and distributors throughout these geographic areas spend a large amount of time with the targeted customers 
over the past several months they have found many of the customers in the automotive  bearing and aircraft industries have referred to the state of the economy and its impact on the machine tool industry as reasons for their reduced ordering activity 
the primary target markets for measurement products have historically been disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers 
management and sales staff monitor industry publications and public financial information in order to judge the potential demand for measurement products by these targeted industries 
as in the prior fiscal year  this information has discussed at length declining demand for and sales of the products of those two industries and has generally defined industries that are in a severe recession 
also  frequent discussions with customers have confirmed the information presented in the public information and their inability to purchase measurement products due to their lack of a capital budget 
historically  the company has enjoyed low cost of sales percentages  with those on its balancing products less than and those on its measurement products less than 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of sales totaled compared to those in fiscal and of and respectively 
fiscal cost of sales decreased significantly from fiscal as the latter fiscal year included large write downs of inventory in the measurement segment and the write off of obsolete inventories in the german subsidiary 
cost of sales in the balancer segment decreased to from in fiscal and in fiscal the cost of sales percentage in fiscal includes a write off of obsolete inventory in the german subsidiary of  which  when excluded from cost of sales  would decrease the percentage to 
cost of sales for measurement products decreased to from and in fiscal and respectively 
fiscal includes an inventory writedown of  and  when the inventory write down is excluded  the cost of sales percentage for fiscal is 
the variation from the percentage in the prior years is due to the sales mix 
management expects the trends in sales and profits during fiscal for the balancer segment to improve slightly while those of the measurement segment will approximate results for fiscal however  no assurances can be made that the company will be profitable or will generate increased sales in future time periods 
general  administrative and sales expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in terms of dollars  these expenses were   and  in fiscal  and respectively 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal occurred as a result of management actions initiated in the second fiscal quarter of that year 
the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal  despite decreasing sales  resulted from the acquisition of acuity research effective june  when the acuity expenses are excluded  these expenses in would have been  lower than those reported in fiscal in future fiscal periods  management believes the company s costs will not increase at the same rate that sales are anticipated to increase  although there can be no such assurance 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in both fiscal and in terms of dollars  these expenses were   and  in fiscal  and respectively 
the company s future operating results depend  to a considerable extent  on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in both the products and services it provides 
for this reason  management believes future investments in research and development are critical to ensure the flow of innovative  productive  high quality products and support services 
accordingly  management expects to continue to place a high priority on research and development projects in the future 
the company realized a net loss of  per share compared to a net loss of  per share in fiscal and net income of  in fiscal per diluted share 
of the net loss in fiscal   per fully diluted share related to the write down to fair market value of the long term investment in air packaging technologies  inc of the net loss in fiscal   per fully diluted share related to the write off of excess inventories in the measurement segment and obsolete inventories of the german subsidiary and  per diluted share related to the expenses incurred in relation to the restructure of the german subsidiary 
net sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal some foreign customers purchase in their own country s currencies  thereby imposing on the company a currency risk 
all us sales of total sales in fiscal were in us dollars and the remaining fiscal sales were in currencies other than us dollars 
to date  currency fluctuations have had minimal impact on revenue realization 
however  significant variations in the value of the us dollar  relative to currencies of countries in which the company has significant competitors  can impact future sales 
the company does not engage in currency hedging 
in addition  the longer payment cycles of international sales can have a negative impact on liquidity 
the company believes international sales will continue to grow in future periods 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from sales to end users through selling agents and directly to builders of machine tools 
the company is dependent on the sales activities of its selling agents  and there can be no assurance these agents will continue to be successful in their efforts to market the company s products 
the company enjoys substantial repeat business from a broad base of customers  but there is no assurance these customers will continue to buy the company s products 
for fiscal years  and  sales to a single customer did not exceed of total revenues 
the company operates in highly competitive industries characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
the company s competitive advantage and future success are therefore dependent on its ability to develop new products  qualify these new products with its customers  successfully introduce these products to the marketplace on a timely basis  commence production to meet customer demands and develop new markets in the industries for its products and services 
the successful introduction of new technology and products is increasingly complex 
if the company is unable  for whatever reason  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its results of operations could be adversely impacted 
liquidity and capital resources the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at may  compared to to at may  as of may  the company had  in cash compared to  at may  during the year ended may   cash provided from operating activities amounted to  with the changes described as follows the net loss for the year ended may  of  plus three noncash items  the write down of the long term investment of  depreciation and amortization of  and a  decrease in the long term deferred tax asset 
accounts receivable provided cash as the balance decreased  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may  at may   no significant accounts receivable were considered a doubtful collection 
the company generally experiences a payment cycle of days on invoices 
management believes its credit and collection policies are effective and appropriate for the marketplace and the company has had no significant bad debt write offs since its inception in there can be no assurance that the company s collection procedures will continue to be successful  particularly with current economic conditions 
inventories decreased  from the balances at may  with inventories in the balancer segment decreasing by  and those in the measurement segment increasing by  the company maintains levels of inventory sufficient to satisfy normal customer demands plus an increasing short term delivery requirement for a majority of its balancer products 
management believes its ability to provide prompt delivery gives it a competitive advantage for certain sales 
prepaid expenses decreased by  due to amortization of several items including prepaid trade show costs  professional fees and various business and life insurance costs 
trade accounts payable decreased by  with the reduction due to the continued decline in purchasing activities of the us companies 
the purchasing activities of those companies  particularly for inventory items  were lower in the weeks proceeding may  than in the weeks preceding may  other accrued liabilities including commission  payroll items and other accrued expenses decreased by  with the largest decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities  and the liability related to the restructure of operations in germany 
during the year ended may   net cash used in investing activities was  consisting of net additions to property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to  which consists of  in long term borrowings  less  in repayments of long term debt and the purchase of shares of the company s common stock for the following summarizes contractual obligations at may  and the effect on future liquidity and cash flows years ending may  long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations thereafter total     the acquisition of sms in fiscal resulted in a tax loss of approximately million  which is available to offset domestic earnings through the year as of may   approximately million of these losses remain 
specific business challenges faced by the company over the past few years have had a negative impact on operations and liquidity 
management has responded to these challenges by reducing operating expenses  developing new products and penetrating new markets for the company s products 
as a result of these efforts  management believes its cash flows from operations  available credit resources and its cash position will provide adequate funds on both a short term and long term basis to cover currently foreseeable debt payments  lease commitments and payments under existing and anticipated supplier agreements 
management believes that such cash flow without the raising of external funds is sufficient to finance current operations  projected capital expenditures  anticipated long term sales agreements and other expansion related contingencies during fiscal however  in the event the company fails to achieve its operating and financials goals in for fiscal  management may be required to take certain actions to finance operations in that time period 
these actions could include  but are not limited to  implementation of additional cost cutting measures  increased borrowings from existing credit facilities or entering into additional borrowing arrangements that are collateralized by assets 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of may  however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
therefore  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as interest paid on debt 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
the company s business and financial condition is  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
to date  the foreign currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted the company s profitability
