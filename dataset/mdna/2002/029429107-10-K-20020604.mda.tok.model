fiscal capital expenditures totaled  this represents a decrease of  or  from the prior year capital expenditures of  capital expenditures were comprised primarily of investments in demo and test equipment  information technology  and furniture and fixtures 
on may   the company closed on a private placement offering of common stock and warrants 
a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each 
net proceeds to the company approximated million 
in addition  warrants to purchase additional  shares of common stock at a price of were issued 
these warrants have a five year life  expiring in may historically  the company has funded it operations and capital expenditures with cash generated by operations  including deposits from customers on long term projects  or from lines of credit available to the company 
in addition  in fiscal  the company received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the proceeds from this private placement offering will be utilized for general corporate purposes including debt repayment  capital expenditures  investments in product development and working capital needs 
the company believes that the proceeds from this offering  along with its cash flows from operations  are sufficient to meet the current and foreseeable operating requirements of the company s business 
on november   the company signed two new credit agreements with hsbc bank usa hsbc 
the first agreement is for a million domestic revolving credit facility to support the company s routine working capital and standby letter of credit needs 
the second is a million export credit and security agreement  guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states to support the company s overseas contract  trade finance and working capital needs 
on february   these credit agreements were amended to increase the domestic revolving credit facility to  and to reduce the export credit facility to  in anticipation of higher domestic demand 
the domestic credit facility as amended provides for maximum borrowings in an amount up to the lower of a the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus the lower of i of eligible inventory  or ii million  or  b million 
the export credit and security agreement as amended provides for maximum borrowings in an amount up to the lower of a the sum of of eligible international billed and unbilled accounts  or b million 
the agreements expire on november  the credit facility bears an interest rate of the hsbc bank usa prime rate or libor plus at the company s option at march  
at the end of fiscal  million in borrowings were outstanding and million in standby letters of credit were in effect against this credit facility 
as noted above  subsequent to year end  the company received million net proceeds from a private placement offering of securities which will be utilized to pay down outstanding debt under the company s domestic revolving credit facility 
the credit agreements are collateralized by certain assets of the company  and contain certain restrictions  including limitations on the amount of distributions that can be made to stockholders  encumbrances of assets  and loans that can be made to officers  and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
as of march   the company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth and cashflow coverage ratio covenants  but has obtained a waiver from the bank for this non compliance for the year end 
with the receipt of the proceeds from the private placement offering of securities  the company expects that it will be in compliance with its tangible net worth covenant at the end of the first quarter and throughout fiscal however  the cash flow coverage ratio covenant is a four quarter trailing requirement and  as a result of losses in prior quarters  the company does not anticipate being in compliance with this covenant at the end of the first or second quarter of fiscal the company will request waivers of this covenant as required at each quarter end 
to the extent the company is unable to obtain such waivers  hsbc could terminate the company s domestic revolving credit and export credit facilities 
in addition  the current credit agreements expire in november and there can be no assurance that hsbc will renew the credit agreements or that alternative financing can be obtained 
as discussed above  the company intends to utilize a portion of the net proceeds received from the private placement in may to pay off the amounts outstanding approximately million as of may  under the domestic credit facilities and management believes the company s working capital requirements through march  can be met without the line of credit 
in addition  to the extent the company s credit facility is terminated  it would preclude the company from obtaining financing through its current secure export credit and security agreement that could negatively impact the company s ability to support international sales 
however  management believes the company s planned level of sales in can be achieved without access to export credit 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase orders with its vendors for the purchase of materials or services to meet its production needs 
certain sole source vendors or vendors producing custom material require significant lead times from order to delivery of their material 
in response to the expected increased demand subsequent to september th  the company entered into certain purchase commitments with key suppliers for this long lead material 
certain of these purchase orders related to these vendors contain cancellation clauses requiring the company to pay for a portion or all of the work in process upon cancellation of an order or to purchase a certain minimum quantities of material by a future date 
should the demand for the company s products decline significantly  or should there be a significant shift in the mix of products being demanded  the company may incur cancellation charges that could be material to the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material losses related to cancellation penalties 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of deferred tax assets  inventories and the valuation of inventories to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  and scope of each contract 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using percentage of completion accounting  generally using a total costs method to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the costs to be incurred under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
the company recognizes other product revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company s products are generally covered by a warranty for a one year period 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
at march   the company had million of net current and non current deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of approximately  the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for valuation allowances quarterly 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
as demonstrated during  demand for products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory were determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance some of the statements contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference are forward looking made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in essence  forward looking statements are predictions of future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties  many of which we are not aware 
it should also be understood that we have no plans to update our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are accurate only as of the date of this report  or in the case of forward looking statements in documents incorporated by reference  as of the date of those documents 
certain risk factors  which might cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  are set forth below 
the company s reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects 
the company s business is heavily dependent on sales to a small number of customers  which include agencies of the united states government 
during fiscal  five customers accounted for of the company s total revenues and during fiscal  three customers accounted for of total revenues 
during fiscal  the company s largest customer  the us customs service  an agency of the united states government  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in general  the company s government contracts may be terminated at the government s discretion 
the termination of the company s relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the company s revenues and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company conducts its business worldwide  which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
the company s international business  including sales to foreign governments  accounted for approximately  and of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   respectively 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of the company s worldwide business operations  it is subject to various risks  including international regulatory requirements and policy changes  lengthy sales cycles  longer payment cycles of foreign customers  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic changes and disruptions  favoritism towards local suppliers  governmental currency controls  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and tariff regulations 
although the company s international sales have been denominated primarily in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for the company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results 
the september  terrorist attacks have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
following the september  terrorist attacks  the united states government made it a national priority to increase security in airports  high threat federal facilities  us military bases  and seaports and borders 
the efforts of the united states government to revamp security in the united states have created increased interest in the company s x ray inspection products 
the company is uncertain whether the level of demand for its products will be as high as anticipated 
the company is uncertain what solutions  if any  ultimately will be adopted and implemented by the united states government and other international entities to combat terrorism and whether the company s products will be a part of the solution 
even if the company s products are considered as part of the security solution  it is unclear what level the company will be involved and how quickly funding to purchase its products may be made available 
the company may incur non recoverable expenditures in anticipation of future demand for its products that may not materialize 
all of these factors may adversely impact the company s operations and create unpredictability in its revenues and operating results 
the company s lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses 
a substantial portion of the company s sales depends in significant part upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites  existing airports  seaports and other facilities 
accordingly  a portion of the company s product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  the company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if the company fails to receive an order after expending these resources  it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company s business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations 
the company s largest customers are governmental agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives 
these priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment 
the company is also exposed to the united states budget approval and appropriation cycle  which may be subject to significant and unpredictable delays 
if demand for the company s products is reduced because of a change in economic or political conditions or if there are delays in receiving governmental approvals and appropriations  sales of the company s products may be adversely affected and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company s products may not obtain all of the required foreign and domestic governmental approvals 
some of the company s x ray inspection products require the approval and certification of the us federal aviation administration the faa  and other us government agencies  and may require from time to time  the approval of foreign government agencies 
there can be no assurance that the company s x ray inspection systems will obtain all of the approvals required by the faa or other agencies  or that even if such approvals are obtained  demand or sales for the company s x ray inspection systems will increase 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the company s products or increase its expenses 
the company competes in markets in which the company or its customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as health and safety and faa regulations 
the company develops  configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the company s products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations  both of which may adversely affect its operating results 
the company s reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects 
the company relies on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products 
in particular  the company currently obtains some of its x ray tubes and related control devices from two sole source suppliers 
the company also relies on sole source suppliers for the assembly of proprietary circuit boards 
while the company has long term supply contracts with a few of its sole source suppliers  it generally purchases these materials on a purchase order basis and does not carry significant inventories of these materials 
the company s reliance on sole or limited supply sources reduces its control over timely delivery  price increases  reliability  and quality of critical components 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these key components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
if the company changes any of its suppliers  the potential new supplier would be required to go through a qualification process  creating potential delays or reductions in product shipments 
the failure of any supplier to provide quality and timely components at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could result in lost or deferred sales  which would harm the company s business and prospects 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which the company participates  it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to its significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
as a result of its fixed costs  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the company s operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect the company s quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include demand for and market acceptance of its x ray inspection systems  changes in political agendas or national priorities  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the company does business  adverse changes in industries on which the company is particularly dependent  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products  changes in the portions of its revenue represented by its various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the company s competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  variations in the company s product mix  the timing and amount of the company s expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its x ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
if the company s x ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety  the company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity  which could result in increased costs  reduced sales  and a decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
there are many factors beyond the company s control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment 
the failure of the company s systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury  loss of life  and extensive property damage and resulting claims against the company 
the company s insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
the company s product liability  umbrella liability  and special aircraft products liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
moreover  there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if liability claims exceed the company s current or available insurance coverage  its business and prospects may be harmed 
regardless of the adequacy of the company s product liability insurance protection  any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation  leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues 
the company may not be able to fund its research and development activities 
the company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations  private sources and the government 
the company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations  other potential private sources  or the government 
the company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources 
additionally  government funding priorities are subject to frequent changes 
for example  in fiscal and  the company earned  and  respectively  for government sponsored research and development 
in fiscal the company did not receive any funds to conduct government sponsored research and development 
there is no guarantee that the company will receive funds from government sponsored research in the future 
if the company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources  the company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis  or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies 
the company s success depends on new product development 
the company s continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products 
the company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products 
the successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements  including  for example  changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of x ray inspection systems  the company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
the company s failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects 
the company s success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for the company s products has been characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing products  successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance 
if the company fails to do so  its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology  in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer 
in developing any new product  the company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if the company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities  it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 
the company may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed products that compete with the company s x ray inspection products 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does 
some of its competitors have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the company does  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
the company s failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete 
in the inspection systems market  competition is based primarily on the following factors product performance  functionality and quality  the overall costs of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner 
the company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyrights  trademarks  licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology 
despite its precautions  the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
the company s patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of some foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
the company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company s business may be materially and adversely affected by infringement claims initiated by the company or its competitors 
initiating or defending against the enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may result in significant  protracted  and costly litigation 
the company was previously involved in civil litigation filed by a competitor seeking a declaratory judgment that the competitor s product did not infringe upon certain of the company s patents 
the company was successful in that action 
the company is currently involved in a civil action filed by the company against a competitor alleging patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets 
the company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future 
the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights  or to establish the validity of its property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any such action 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to it and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses for the infringing technology 
if a license were required  the company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable 
the company s future success will depend on the continued services of its key personnel 
the loss of any of the company s executive officers or key research and development personnel  could harm its business and prospects 
the company s success also depends upon its ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly software engineers and other technical personnel  is intense 
the company may be unable to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development of its business 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the services of ralph sheridan  its president and chief executive officer 
the company has an employment agreement with mr 
sheridan  which expires in september the loss of mr 
sheridan s services could harm the company s business and prospects 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while the company s compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of all of its key employees or a sufficient number to execute on its plans  nor can there be any assurances that the company will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
future sales of the company s common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of the company s common stock 
substantially all of the company s outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration 
affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of rule  except for the holding period requirements 
nevertheless  sales of substantial amounts of common stock by the company s stockholders  or even the potential for such sales  may cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline and could impair the company s ability to raise capital through the sale of the company s equity securities 
existing external financing may not be sufficient to satisfy short term cash requirements or may not be available in the future 
the company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations 
the company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable  that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations  or  if necessary  that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any existing financing arrangements may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash needs or may not be available in the future  or  if available  at a cost which the company believes is reasonable 
the volatility of the company s stock price could adversely affect an investment in the company s common stock 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
the company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including announcements of developments related to the company s business  including announcements of certification by the faa or other regulatory authorities of the company or its competitors products  quarterly fluctuations in the company s actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  general conditions in the worldwide economy  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and developments in the company s relationships with its customers and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high tech companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
provisions in the company s articles of organization and the company s shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for the company s business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
provisions in the company s articles of organization and the company s stockholder purchase rights plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
the company does not plan to pay dividends on its common stock 
the company has not declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock in recent years and it does not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company intends to retain all earnings  if any  in order to expand its operations 
investors should not rely on dividends from the common stock as a possible source of income
