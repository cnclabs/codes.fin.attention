overview the company classifies its business activities into four fundamental segments north american outsourcing  international outsourcing  database marketing and consulting  and corporate activities 
north american outsourcing consists of customer management services provided in the us and canada 
north american and international outsourcing also include facilities management arrangements client owned centers 
these segments are consistent with the company s management of the business and generally reflect its internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
north american and international outsourcing provide comprehensive customer management solutions 
database marketing and consulting provide outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
included in corporate activities are general corporate expenses  operational management expenses not attributable to any other segment and technology services 
segment accounting policies are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements 
there are no significant transactions between the reported segments for the periods presented 
teletech generates its revenues primarily by providing customer management solutions 
the company s fully outsourced customer interaction centers serve either multiple clients multi client centers or one dedicated client dedicated centers 
the company bills for its services based primarily on the amount of time teletech representatives devote to a client s program  and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the company also derives revenues from consulting services  including the sale of customer interaction center and customer management technology  automated customer support  database management  systems integration  web based applications and distance based learning and education 
these consulting and technology revenues historically have not been a significant component of the company s revenues 
the company seeks to enter into multiyear contracts with its clients that cannot be terminated for convenience except upon the payment of a termination fee 
the majority of the company s revenues are  and the company anticipates that the majority of its future revenues will continue to be  from multiyear contracts 
however  the company does provide some programs on a short term basis and the company s operations outside of north america are characterized by shorter term contracts 
the company s ability to enter into new multiyear contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  may be dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which its customers are operating 
a weakening of the us and or global economy could cause longer sales cycles or delays in closing new business opportunities 
as a result of a weakening global economy  the company encountered delays in both the ramp up of some existing client programs as well as the closing of sales opportunities for large customer care programs during teletech s profitability is significantly influenced by its customer interaction center capacity utilization 
the company seeks to optimize new and existing capacity utilization during both peak weekday and off peak night and weekend periods to achieve maximum fixed cost absorption 
historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been generated during peak periods 
teletech may be adversely impacted by idle capacity in its fully outsourced centers if prior to the opening or expansion of a customer interaction center  the company has not contracted for the provision of services or if a client program does not reach its intended level of operations on a timely basis 
in addition  the company can also be adversely impacted by idle capacity in its facilities management contracts 
in a facilities management contract  the company does not incur the costs of the facilities and equipment  however  the costs of the management team supporting the customer interaction center are semi fixed in nature  and absorption of these costs will be negatively impacted if the customer interaction center has idle capacity 
the company attempts to plan the development and opening of new customer interaction centers to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity 
in planning the opening of new centers or the expansion of existing centers  management considers numerous factors that affect its capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations or expansions of existing programs  and the size and timing of new client contracts that the company expects to obtain 
the company continues to concentrate its marketing efforts toward obtaining larger  more complex  strategic customer management programs 
as a result  the time required to negotiate and execute an agreement with the client can be significant 
to enable the company to respond rapidly to changing market demands  implement new programs and expand existing programs  teletech may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
teletech targets capacity utilization in its fully outsourced centers at of its available workstations during the weekday period 
during  the company carried approximately four customer interaction centers of excess capacity above and beyond normal expected levels 
from time to time the company assesses the expected long term capacity utilization of its centers 
accordingly  the company may  if deemed necessary  consolidate or shutdown under performing centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
the company records costs specifically associated with client programs as costs of services 
these costs  which include direct labor wages and benefits  telecommunication charges and certain facility costs are primarily variable in nature 
all other expenses of operations  including technology support  sales and marketing  human resource management and other administrative functions and customer interaction center operational expenses that are not allocable to specific programs  are recorded as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses tend to be either semi variable or fixed in nature 
the majority of the company s operating expenses have consisted of labor costs 
representative wage rates  which comprise the majority of the company s labor costs  have been and are expected to continue to be a key component of the company s expenses 
some of the company s contracts with its clients contain clauses allowing adjustment of billing rates in accordance with wage inflation 
the cost characteristics of teletech s fully outsourced programs differ significantly from the cost characteristics of its facilities management programs 
under facilities management programs  customer interaction centers and the related equipment are owned by the client but are staffed and managed by teletech 
accordingly  facilities management programs have higher costs of services as a percentage of revenues and lower sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues than fully outsourced programs 
additionally  the cost characteristics of the company s dedicated centers differ from the cost characteristics of its multi client centers 
dedicated centers have lower sg a expenses than multi client centers as they do not require as many resources for management and other administrative functions 
accordingly  multi client centers have higher sg a as a percentage of revenues than dedicated centers 
as a result  the company expects its overall gross margin will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis as revenues attributable to fully outsourced programs vary in proportion to revenues attributable to facilities management programs 
management believes the company s operating margin  which is income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues  is a better measure of profitability on a period to period basis than gross margin 
operating margin may be less subject to fluctuation as the proportion of the company s business portfolio attributable to fully outsourced programs versus facilities management programs changes 
revenue from facilities management contracts represented  and of consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the company has used business combinations and acquisitions to expand the company s international customer management operations and to obtain complementary technology solution offerings to extend its product line and vertical market presence
