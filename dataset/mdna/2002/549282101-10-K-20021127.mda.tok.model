food to go packaging costs further declined due to the intentional redirection at many locations to inside dining coupled with less expensive packaging 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or

charges of  were provided for in the current year principally to account for labor termination costs and an additional store closing  net of unrelated lease settlements that were more favorable than anticipated 
interest expense decreased million  or  due primarily to lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt  the payoff of the loans on surrendered officers life insurance policies  and payment reductions in the line of credit

ebitda ebitda  excluding noncash stock compensation  increased by 
million for the current fiscal year in comparison with the prior fiscal year 
the operating performance of the company is evaluated using several measures  one of which is ebitda 
the company s amended credit agreement defines ebitda as operating income before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and the noncash portion of the ceo s and the coo s stock option compensation 
while the company and many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  such as operating income and net income 
in addition  the company s definition of ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased million  or  primarily due to store closures as well as market conditions in the fiscal year 
this decline was partially offset by a price increase on the lu ann platter 
additionally  the heavily discounted luby s platter and bigdo bundled offerings that were launched in the fourth quarter of were discontinued in the third quarter of excluding leap day in fiscal  same store sales decreased million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal cost of food decreased million  or  due to various factors  including store closures and the discontinuance of more costly product purchases 
although sales decreased  payroll and related costs increased by million  or  in comparison to the prior year 
a significant portion of this  million  was due to higher claims accruals 
the company incurred higher than average and more frequent workers compensation claims than were experienced in prior years 
to help prevent injuries and better control costs  the company launched a new in house safety and claims program the following fiscal year 
occupancy and other operating expenses increased million  or 
this increase was due primarily to higher utility costs resulting from increased commodity rates  higher property taxes related to new stores and remodels  and higher repair expenses incurred as part of an initiative by new management to bring all stores up to a higher standard of maintenance and appearance 
these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expense due to a new strategic focus 
lower preopening expenses due to opening fewer restaurants in the current fiscal year also contributed to the offset 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in comparison to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to noncash compensation of million related to stock options granted to the company s ceo and the coo

as a result of its continuing efforts to redeploy both capital and human resources to improve financial performance and strengthen the organization  the company recorded a pretax charge of million during the year for store closings  associated costs  and asset impairment charges 
the principal components of the charge were as follows million for the closing of underperforming restaurants  two of which the company continues to operate 
this charge included the cost to write down the properties and equipment to net realizable value and estimated costs for the settlement of lease obligations  legal and professional fees  and other exit costs 
employee severance costs were not accrued 
million for asset impairment of restaurants that the company planned to keep open 
due to other subsequent events  the company later closed three of these units 
in accordance with statement of financial standards sfas no 
 the properties were written down to the estimated future discounted cash flows or fully written off in the case of negative future cash flows 

million primarily for the impairment of one property operated under a joint venture with waterstreet  inc the joint venture  l w seafood  inc  was terminated in this property was written down to its estimated net realizable value and was sold in fiscal year million associated with the write off of assets for two locations that were remodeled and reopened before the end of fiscal year property that cannot be salvaged  transferred  or effectively reused has been written off 
see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense of million for fiscal was incurred in conjunction with borrowings under the credit facility and is net of  capitalized on qualifying properties 
the increase from fiscal of million  or  was due primarily to higher average borrowings under the credit facility agreement and less capitalized interest in the current year due to decreased construction 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  due primarily to lower income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash decreased by million from the end of the preceding fiscal year to august   primarily due to an increase in short term investments 
the million total income tax receivable balance as of august   relates to current year tax benefits that are recoverable in the form of refunds in fiscal these refunds accrued from recently enacted changes in tax legislation that extended carrybacks of net operating losses 
excluding the reclassification of the credit facility balance as explained in the debt section below  the company had a working capital deficit of million at august   in comparison to a working capital deficit of million at august  the decline in the deficit was primarily attributable to lower accruals for claims and insurance under the company s new safety training and accident prevention programs offset by an increase in payables associated with the company s new accounting close system 
under this system  the company closes each period on wednesdays 
fiscal ended on a friday  while company disbursement runs were consistently on fridays for both fiscal years 
as of august   the company owned properties held for sale  including six undeveloped land sites 
the company also had six properties held for future use 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended august   were million 
the company intends to fund all capital expenditures for fiscal from cash flows from operations and expects them to be no more than million for that fiscal year 
management continues to focus on improving the appearance  functionality  and sales at existing restaurants 
these efforts also include  where feasible  remodeling certain locations to other dining concepts 
in the second quarter of fiscal  one existing property was remodeled to create the company s first new concept  luby s seafood  in huntsville  texas 
after year end  the company remodeled and reopened another previously closed location as its first steak buffet 
potential dining themes for the three planned remodels in fiscal are still under consideration 
debt as of september   the company had a balance of million outstanding under its credit facility 
in fiscal year  five principal payments totaling million reduced the loan balance to million as of august  there is no provision for additional borrowing under the existing agreement 
under the agreement terms that were in place during fiscal and through the first quarter of fiscal  the company was required to meet certain indicated ebitda levels 
ebitda is defined in the agreement as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and noncash executive compensation 
the annual ebitda requirement was met for fiscal year however  the company fell short of its fourth quarter ebitda requirement 
after the end of the fiscal year  management obtained a waiver for the fourth quarter requirement and an amendment to the debt agreement 
the amendment extended the debt s maturity to october   and increased the applicable interest rate from prime plus to prime plus 
additionally  the financial covenant was changed from quarterly and annual ebitda measurements to one that assesses liquidity and future debt service 
management believes the new covenant is achievable and considers it to be more appropriate for the collateralized credit facility 
meanwhile  the company has executed a commitment letter with another financial entity for an million loan 
its purpose is to replace that amount of debt in the existing credit facility 
thus  the amendment discussed above requires that the entire proceeds from this other financial entity be used to pay down the credit facility 
in the event the company is unable to make the million payment as currently planned  the amended loan would be in default 
the existing lenders would then have the right to exercise any and all remedies  including the right to demand immediate repayment of the entire outstanding balance or the right to pursue foreclosure on the assets pledged as collateral 
as of august   million of the company s total book value  or of its total assets  including the company s owned real estate  improvements  equipment  and fixtures  was pledged as collateral under the credit facility 
th e nonbinding commitment letter with the new lender is subject to conditions the company must satisfy before the actual financing can occur 
management is currently working toward this goal and has high confidence that the transaction will be completed and the financing closed by january  the company also could pursue other options if its current refinancing plans cannot be finalized 
those options include financing through high yield debt at higher than commercial rates or conducting additional equity security sales through public or private offerings 
dilution to existing shareholders would result in the case of equity security sales 
assuming the million requirement is met  the amended facility also includes two principal payments 
the first is a target of million that is also to be paid by january   from either operating cash flow or proceeds from the sale of property 
failure to pay the entire million would result in a increase in the applicable interest rate from prime plus to prime plus 
the second payment  from operating cash flow or property sales  is an additional million by september  again  payment of any amount less than million would result in another increase in the applicable interest rate 
while negotiations and plan execution are under way  the company continues to take steps to improve its cash position  operating results and cash flows  including the launch of new restaurant offerings and cost saving initiatives in the areas of risk management  labor optimization  and purchasing 
variable rate debt as of the year end  the company currently had a total of million in variable rate debt million under its credit facility at prime plus and million in subordinated convertible notes loaned to the company by its ceo and coo at libor london interbank offered rate plus 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in prior fiscal years  the company had interest rate protection agreements swaps that effectively fixed the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate debt under its line of credit 
the company terminated its swaps effective july   due to declining interest rates 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies in connection with the luby s incentive stock plan as approved by the shareholders of the company at the january   annual meeting of shareholders  the company guaranteed loans in fiscal of approximately million to enable officers to purchase stock in the company 
as of august   the notes  which each officer obtained from jpmorgan chase bank and mature in fiscal  have a total outstanding balance of approximately million 
the purchased company stock has been and can be used by the borrowers to satisfy a portion of their obligation 
the company does not anticipate default on the loans by any of the borrowers  however  in the event of default  the company is obligated to purchase the specific borrower s loan from jpmorgan chase bank and would therefore become the holder of the note 
if the company becomes the holder of any defaulted notes  it intends to pursue collection using all available remedies 
 see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
affiliate services the company entered into an affiliate services agreement effective august   with two companies  pappas partners  lp and pappas restaurants  inc  which are restaurant entities owned by christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas 
that agreement  as amended on july   limited the scope of expenditures therein to professional and consulting services 
the company completed this amendment due to a significant decline in the use of professional and consulting services from pappas entities 
in hiring its own employees to internally provide these services  the company s relative costs decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal additionally  on july   the company entered into a master sales agreement with the same pappas entities 
through this agreement  the company contractually separated the design and fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the affiliate services agreement 
the master sales agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to existing equipment  as well as custom fabrication  including stainless steel stoves  shelving  rolling carts  and chef tables 
these items are custom designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured equipment 
the pricing of equipment  repair  and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for comparable goods and services 
the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors also uses independent valuation consultants to assist in periodically monitoring pricing of the transactions associated with the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement 
the company s external auditors performed agreed upon procedures related to the affiliate services 
the scope and sufficiency of such procedures are determined by management and the board of directors  and results are submitted to the board for its use in evaluating the fairness of the transactions 
as part of the affiliation with the pappas entities  the company leases a facility  the houston service center  in which luby s has installed a centralized restaurant service center to support field operations 
the building at this location has  square feet of warehouse space and  square feet of office space 
it is leased from the pappas entities by the company at a monthly rate of 
per square foot 
from this center  luby s repair and service teams are dispatched to the company s restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are needed 
the facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment 
the following compares fiscal and inception to date charges incurred under the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement to total general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  and occupancy and other operating expenses fiscal year fiscal year total for all periods of total in thousands affiliate services incurred costs general and administrative expenses professional services capital expenditures custom fabricated and refurbished equipment occupancy and other operating expenses  including houston service center lease less pass through amounts to third parties total applicable total company costs general and administrative expenses capital expenditures occupancy and other operating expenses total affiliate services incurred costs as a percentage of applicable total company costs trends and uncertainties same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service 
the company has experienced declining same store sales since as a result of previous execution strategies  as well as increased industry wide competition 
the company competes with a large number of other restaurants  many of which have greater financial resources 
management believes the company s success will depend largely on its ability to execute its new strategies  optimize its financial resources  and respond to changes in consumer preferences  as well as to general economic conditions 
the following shows the comparative change in same store sales fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q the company enacted price increases in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the first quarter of fiscal includes september  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company was able to maintain its comparative cash flow level with declining sales by lowering operating costs 
the company may find additional opportunities to lower costs  however  continued declines in net same store sales could reduce operating cash flow 
if severe declines in cash flow were to develop without offsetting reductions in uses of cash  such as capital expenditures  the company s ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of the amended credit facility may be impaired 
in such an event  the lender would have the right to terminate the credit facility  accelerate the maturity of any outstanding obligation under that facility  and pursue foreclosure on assets pledged as collateral 
new programs in addition to those alluded to earlier  the company has initiated a number of programs since march these programs  as listed below  are intended to address the decline in total and same store sales  while prudently managing costs and increasing overall profitability food excellence  service excellence  emphasis on value  including all you can eat promotions  increased emphasis on employee training and development  targeted marketing  especially directed at families  closure of certain underperforming restaurants  new concept conversions  and continued emphasis on in house safety training  accident prevention  and claims management 
impairment statement of financial accounting standards sfas requires the company to review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses or negative cash flows and unfavorable changes in market conditions to be its main indicators of potential impairment 
assets are generally evaluated for impairment at the restaurant level 
if a restaurant does not meet its financial investment objectives or continues to incur negative cash flows or operating losses  an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods 
insurance and claims workers compensation and employee injury claims expense decreased substantially in comparison with the prior fiscal year due to improved cost control  safety training and accident prevention efforts  well as the management of new claims in house 
actual claims settlements and expenses may differ from estimated interim loss provisions 
the company cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program or whether declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experienced in fiscal will continue in future periods 
the company may be the subject of claims or litigation from guests and employees alleging injuries as a result of its operations 
in addition  unfavorable publicity from such allegations could have an adverse impact on financial results  regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome 
minimum wage and labor costs from time to time  the us congress considers an increase in the federal minimum wage 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive  and in such case  the company may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases in operating costs to its customers in the form of price increases 
in addition  since the company s business is labor intensive  shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs 
reserve for restaurant closings the reserve for restaurant closings declined from million at august   to million at august   primarily due to the payment of lease settlement costs of approximately  and further reductions associated with more favorable lease settlements than originally anticipated

critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations 
the company believes it is improbable that materially different amounts would be reported relating to the accounting policies described below if other acceptable approaches were adopted 
however  the application of these accounting policies  as described below  involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  therefore  actual results could differ from estimates generated from their use 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing impairment reviews of such restaurants  the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
the company considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
insurance and claims the company periodically reviews its workers compensation and general liability reserves to ensure reasonableness 
in fiscal  the company initiated an in house safety and claims program focused on safety training and rigorous scrutiny of new claims  which has reduced costs significantly 
consistent with the prior year  the company s liability is based upon estimates obtained from both an actuarial firm and internal risk management staff 
assumptions and judgments are used in evaluating these costs 
the possibility exists that future claims related liabilities could increase due to unforeseen circumstances 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard requires the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the company plans to adopt the pronouncement in fiscal the company does not expect a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of this standard 
the company has accounted for the cessation of operations under the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
in june  fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the company will also adopt the accounting requirement of sfas in fiscal and does not anticipate the effects to the financial statements to be material 
inflation the company s policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
general increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  and services make it necessary for the company to increase its menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  the company intends to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
forward looking statements the company wishes to caution readers that various factors could cause its actual financial and operational results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made from time to time in news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications including the preceding sections of this management s discussion and analysis  as well as oral statements made from time to time by representatives of the company 
except for historical information  matters discussed in such oral and written communications are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to general business conditions  the impact of competition  the success of operating initiatives  changes in the cost and supply of food and labor  the seasonality of the company s business  taxes  inflation  governmental regulations  and the availability of credit  as well as other risks and uncertainties disclosed in per iodic reports on form k and form q
