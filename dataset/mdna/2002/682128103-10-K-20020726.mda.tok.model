we design  develop and market high performance  high quality and cost efficient semiconductor imaging devices for computing  communications  industrial  automotive and consumer electronics applications 
our main product  an image sensing device called a camerachip tm  is used to capture an image in cameras and camera related products in high volume imaging applications such as personal computer cameras  digital still cameras  security and surveillance cameras  personal digital assistant cameras and mobile phone cameras and cameras for automobiles and toys for both still picture and live video applications 
we have developed our camerachips using the standard semiconductor manufacturing process used for approximately ninety percent of modern integrated circuits 
this enables us to take advantage of the many benefits of high volume  mainstream semiconductor manufacturing such as low cost  high reliability  volume capacity and competitive lead times 
in addition  unlike competitive image sensors  which require multiple chips to achieve the same functions  we are able to integrate nearly all camera functions into a single camerachip 
this leads us to believe that we supply the most highly integrated  single chip image sensing device 
our highly integrated chip design offers competitive advantages that can allow our customers to design cameras that are lower in cost  smaller  lighter in weight  consume less power  are more reliable and more easily integrated with other circuits than cameras using multiple chip image sensors 
our camerachips are currently used for the following applications o digital still cameras  personal computer video cameras  personal digital assistant cameras and mobile phone cameras which are used for capturing images that can be stored  downloaded  viewed  edited and manipulated  and for internet applications such as creating still and live video for websites and e mail  o security and surveillance systems and closed circuit television systems including onsite and remote security cameras for both home and business and surveillance systems such as baby monitors and door phones  and o toys and games such as highly interactive participatory video games where the users motions and images can be incorporated into the game and his or her motions  rather than a joystick or mouse  control actions in the game 
we assist our customers in developing new camerachip specifications that are required for emerging applications 
we believe that these applications will be marketable within the next three years 
examples of such applications include o personal identification systems such as fingerprint scanners  retina scanners and face recognition systems  o medical imaging devices used for routine doctors office examinations  o machine control systems such as bar code readers  production control systems and quality inspection systems  o automotive applications such as cameras that may replace rear and side view mirrors  provide inadvertent lane departure and blind spot collision detection  air bag inflation sensors  rear approach headlight auto dimming sensors  accident recorders  driver monitors and maintenance inspection systems  and o videophones integrated in tabletop phones 
we have shipped approximately million camerachips in the year ended april   or fiscal year  as compared to approximately million camerachips in the year ended april   or fiscal year our customers include industry leading original equipment manufacturers  or oem  such as alaris  inc  or alaris  creative technologies ltd  or creative  teksel co  ltd  or teksel  who distributes our products to kyocera corporation  or kyocera  x wireless technology  inc  or x  and viewquest technologies  inc  or viewquest 
our objective is to be a leading supplier of camerachips for camera manufacturers by o focusing on capturing and expanding mass market applications  o targeting camera manufacturers by assisting them in the design and development of their products  o maintaining our technology leadership by continuing to develop our core technology  o continuing to develop new products aimed at new and existing markets  and o continuing to establish both formal and informal strategic relationships with key suppliers and customers 
industry background growth of digital video imaging multimedia technology and its uses have grown in the past decade 
a significant driver of this growth in multimedia has been the growth of video technologies 
many large industries including the movie  television  publishing and computer industries depend directly on video technologies to create and deliver their products 
traditionally all video  still image and sound products were based on analog technologies 
more recently  computer based video technology has been replacing traditional analog image and sound capture technologies  such as conventional cameras  film and tape recorders 
this has begun to occur because digital technology offers enhanced quality  manipulation and storage capabilities that analog technologies lack 
for example  a movie recorded and stored digitally can be easily edited and enhanced  can be easily searched and will not suffer degradation over time 
the internet and miniaturization of electronics fuel demand for video imaging video and image capture on pcs was first used in videoconferencing applications 
however  early videoconferencing applications were expensive  and suffered from poor image quality and inadequate network infrastructure 
video conferencing grew rapidly as image quality improved and cameras became more affordable 
according to a study published by the cahners in stat group in july  the market for pc cameras is predicted to grow from approximately million units in to approximately million units by as cameras became readily available on pcs  applications other than videoconferencing quickly followed 
the introduction of the world wide web browser  with its hypertext and uniform resource locator  or url  address system  changed the internet from a text based system to a multimedia driven network that features sound  pictures and live video clips 
fueled by the growth of the internet as a method to publish  transport and store images  the number of pictures generated is expected to grow significantly as different uses of imaging and video continue to emerge 
today pc video cameras are used for capturing still pictures and live video clips used for web sites  video email  video greeting cards  web based photo exchanges  desktop publishing and interactive games 
as network bandwidth continues to improve  transferring images across pc systems and communication networks will become even easier  further driving the demand for video and multimedia applications 
miniaturization has moved computing from the desktop to a wide assortment of portable and hand held devices including laptops  personal digital assistants  electronic games and mobile phones 
these battery operated devices are creating an opportunity for small  low power  low cost digital still cameras to be integrated directly into the portable device so that images can be captured for transfer to computer systems using wired or wireless methods 
examples of commercial uses for these captured images include property damage pictures for insurance claims  images of competitive products for analysis  or enhancement of computer contact databases 
the more recent digital still cameras use a live video image sensor to display a real time image on a miniature  built in display which serves as a viewfinder 
still images captured by the same image sensor and stored in the camera are transferred to a computer system for viewing  editing  transmitting and printing 
when connected to the computer  digital still cameras can also function like pc video cameras 
these devices have made a significant impact on the camera market by taking market share from film based cameras and are one of the fastest growing consumer electronic products 
advances in image sensor technology image sensors are at the center of all electronic cameras 
image sensors capture an image through a lens and convert that image into electronic signals 
charged couple device  or ccd  technology has dominated the image sensor market for over years 
however  production is concentrated with relatively few  large  primarily vertically integrated manufacturers 
according to the cahners july study  the top six ccd image sensor manufacturers  fuji corporation  or fuji  matsushita electric industrial  or matsushita  nippon electric corporation or nec  sharp corporation  or sharp  sony corporation  or sony  and toshiba corporation  or toshiba  account for approximately of total ccd image sensor production 
a newer  easier to use semiconductor technology  complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  has been adopted for most common integrated circuits 
although cmos technology has been available for image sensor designs for over years  until recently it has not been used in commercial products because of poorer image quality 
recent improvements in cmos  including smaller size circuits  better current control  and a more stable fabrication process  have made it possible to design cmos image sensors that provide high image quality and that have many advantages over ccd image sensors 
advantages of cmos over ccd technology cmos technology has many advantages over ccd technology including o cameras using cmos image sensors consume as little as one tenth as much power as those using ccd technology  making them more suitable for battery operated applications 
o cmos image sensors require only one voltage  the three or five volts typically used for modern integrated cmos circuits  while ccd image sensors require three separate and different voltages  which means that cmos image sensors are easier and less costly to integrate into companion circuit boards 
o cmos technology permits integration of more functions into fewer chips  providing space  cost  product design and reliability advantages 
cameras using cmos technology do not require as many semiconductors as cameras using ccd technology 
o the cmos fabrication process requires fewer masking steps than the ccd fabrication process 
the ccd fabrication process generally requires to masking steps  which is two to three times more complex than the typical cmos fabrication process 
o cmos image sensors do not cause an image to lose definition when directed towards bright light while ccd image sensors create a blurry or smeared image 
in addition  since ccd technology is used only for image sensors  future improvements in the core technology and the fabrication process are concentrated among a few large  vertically integrated equipment manufactures 
such concentration tends to limit innovation and investments 
because of the advantages of cmos technology as compared to ccd technology  cmos image sensors are projected to constitute the majority of all image sensor units shipped by according to the cahners july study 
again  according to that study  cahners forecasts that cmos s share of the image sensor market will grow from approximately in to in in particular  cahners in stat group predicts that in  approximately of the expected million pc cameras will use cmos image sensors 
cahners in stat group also predicts that in  cmos technology will account for approximately of the million digital still cameras 
applications for cmos image sensors based on discussions with current and potential customers  we anticipate that the newer cmos image sensors will help move video applications into many new mass markets  particularly where low cost  low power consumption and small size are important 
some of these applications include o a wide array of personal identification systems  including fingerprint scanners  retina scanners and face recognition systems that can be used for credit card and debit card authorization  opening a hotel door  entering a car or home  accessing a computer or online network  and any number of applications where a system needs to validate an individual s identity  o a wide array of medical instruments used for routine doctors office examinations  o videophones integrated into tabletop phones  o automotive applications such as cameras that may replace rear and side view mirrors  sensors that provide inadvertent lane departure and blind spot collision detection  air bag inflation sensors  rear approach headlight auto dimming sensors  accident recorders  driver monitors and maintenance inspection systems  and o machine control applications  including bar code readers  production control systems and quality control monitors 
however  we believe that multiple chip cmos image sensors do not fully take advantage of the benefits enabled by cmos technology 
image sensors that require more than one chip are more expensive  larger and heavier  consume more power  are less reliable and are more difficult to integrate with other electronic circuits 
as a result  multiple chip image sensors may not be ideal for many new mass market applications 
our solution we design  develop and market our high performance  high quality and cost efficient camerachips for computing  communications  industrial  automotive  and consumer electronics applications 
we have developed our camerachips using the standard cmos manufacturing process used for approximately of modern integrated circuits 
our proprietary circuit design integrates the image capture  the image processing function  the color processing and the conversion and output into a single chip 
the result is a fully processed and formatted image or video stream capable of being easily utilized by industry standard digital or analog equipment 
this allows integrators of our technology to focus on their specific image application without specialized development or specific expertise on image sensor functions 
as a result  unlike competitive image sensors  which require multiple chips to achieve the same functions  we are able to integrate nearly all the camera functions into a single chip 
customers can use our highly integrated camerachip to design camera products that are lower in cost  smaller in size  lighter in weight  consume less power and are more reliable and easier to integrate with other electronic circuits than cameras using the traditional ccd technology or multiple chip cmos image sensors 
our camerachips are used in conjunction with our interface chips or other manufacturers adaptor chips to connect directly to a personal computer or to provide additional functions such as video and still image compression 
our camerachips provide a number of benefits to our customers  including the following o lower cost 
the highly integrated design of our camerachips allows our customers to build cameras that are generally less expensive than ones using ccd technology 
our single chip technology also allows our customers to build cameras that generally are less expensive than cameras using multiple chip cmos image sensors 
o lower power consumption 
a device using our camerachip can require as little as one tenth of the power required for a ccd camera and half the power required for a multiple chip cmos camera  making our solution more suitable for battery powered operation 
in addition  cmos camerachips use a single voltage while ccd image sensors require three voltages 
as a result of this simplicity  our customers can more easily and quickly design camera products 
o smaller size 
our highly integrated chip design allows our customers to develop cameras that are smaller in size and lighter in weight than cameras that use ccd or multiple chip cmos image sensors 
for portable applications  size and weight are critical factors in a consumer s buying decision 
additionally  devices using our camerachips are generally more reliable because there are fewer parts to fail 
o streamlined manufacturing and production 
our camerachips are well suited for large scale production 
competing ccd image sensors must each be individually hand calibrated to match companion components to maximize the image quality due to the inconsistency of the image output 
our camerachips provide consistent quality making streamlined manufacturing possible 
additionally  our camerachips can be mounted onto a printed circuit board using automatic insertion equipment and can run through standard automatic re flow soldering lines  whereas ccd image sensors must each be individually placed and soldered by hand 
o ease of use 
our camerachips are offered as part of a complete design solution for many markets 
as opposed to ccd and other cmos image sensor manufacturers  we offer a complete solution for our customers which includes camera designs  optimized interface chips  and windows r and apple computer imac r software drivers to enable a plug and play connection of the camera to a personal computer 
o accelerated time to market 
the highly integrated nature of our camerachips simplifies the design of cameras and allows our customers to shorten their product design time 
we also help our customers accelerate their time to market by providing camera reference designs  engineering design review services and customer product evaluation testing and debugging services 
products we design  develop and market our high performance  high quality and cost efficient cmos camerachips for computing  communications  industrial  automotive and consumer electronics applications 
we have developed proprietary designs for camerachips that include the image capture  image processing circuitry  color processing and image formatting 
our products allow our customers to control the chip functions and thereby provide custom  proprietary features in their application software or hardware design so that they can offer unique products to end users 
our technology provides a platform for different products that allow our customers to choose the most appropriate features for their applications 
these features include product features complementary metal oxide semiconductor camerachip black and white or color low resolution resolutions medium resolution high resolution output signal analog for television digital for computers other digital devices operating voltage volt or volt optical lens size    or inch format interface chips for connecting to computers other devices software drivers windows  windows ce  linux and apple tm computer software drivers the following table summarizes our current camerachip product offerings cmos camerachips product black and color introduction white sensors sensors resolution output target markets date ov low ntsc or pal for tv security and surveillance toys and games ov ov medium ntsc or pal for tv security and surveillance close circuit television toys and games ov ov low for computers pc video cameras toys and games machine control ov ov low for computers pc video cameras toys and games machine control ov ov low for computers mobile devices volt pc video cameras ov ov medium for computers pc video cameras digital still cameras machine control ov ov medium for computers mobile devices volt pc video cameras digital still cameras machine control ov ov medium for computers pc video cameras high digital still cameras machine control ov ov high for computers pc video cameras digital still cameras machine control we also provide companion chips used to interface our camerachips to the universal serial bus  a connection which allows add on devices to be connected to personal computers 
these low cost  proprietary designed chips accept the live video output from our camerachips  perform data compression and handle the bus protocol for transferring the image data to the personal computer 
they also act as a master for passing programming information to and from our camerachip 
we also design  develop and license plug and play software drivers for microsoft windows and apple computer imac system 
these software drivers accept the image data being received from the universal serial bus  provide the data decompression if required and manage interface protocols with the camera 
these drivers have been designed for speed and flexibility and allow easy customization of the user interface to represent the customer s brand to the end user 
customers our customers include industry leading camera manufacturers  contract manufacturers and distributors 
during fiscal year  we shipped approximately million camerachips as compared to approximately million camerachips during fiscal year the following table describes representative camera manufacturer customers who purchase our products for their own branded products and contract manufacturers who build products for a camera manufacturer

in these cases we typically help these third party manufacturers bring the design to production 
once the production is ready  we sell our products to these third party manufacturers either directly or through distributors 
for example  samsung electronics manufacturing company  or semco  a major manufacturer in korea  manufactures a personal digital assistant camera for creative 
in many cases these third party manufacturers may also introduce us to additional camera manufacturers with whom they have relationships 
in fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from camera manufacturers and their contract manufacturers 
our largest customer  x  accounted for approximately of our revenues 
no other single camera manufacturer customer represented more than of revenues 
in fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from distributors 
the largest distributor was world peace industrial co 
ltd  or world peace  which represented approximately of revenues 
no other single distributor represented more than of revenues 
we have signed distribution agreements with most of our distributors  including world peace 
strategic relationships we have established an informal strategic relationship with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corp  or tsmc  both in taiwan and in the united states 
tsmc is one of our primary sources of wafer fabrication 
this relationship includes joint engineering projects aimed at improving production yields  improving image quality and correlating final packaged chip testing and wafer level testing 
we provide extensive  in depth technical expertise on camerachip design issues  which has allowed tsmc to develop an image sensor production business 
tsmc provides us with extensive  in depth technical expertise on variations of the cmos semiconductor fabrication process which assists us in improving the design and production of our camerachips 
we are one of tsmc s largest customers for cmos image sensors and in the past we have received preferential capacity scheduling 
we have signed an agreement with powerchip semiconductor corp  or psc  as a second source for wafer fabrication 
by working closely with psc s engineers  we have been able to design new camerachip products that take advantage of psc s memory chip fabrication processes 
psc s fabrication process gives us a number of important improvements  including better current control for better image quality 
in return  we have assisted psc in image sensor fabrication 
we have several informal strategic relationships with key customers in the development of new camera products incorporating our camerachips 
by working directly with key customers  we can help them take advantage of our camerachips capabilities and can inform them of new developments so they can market their products more quickly 
by learning more about our customers desires and requirements we are able to plan and prioritize our product development projects 
some of these key customers include creative  for pc video cameras and digital still cameras  alaris for cameras for toys  viewquest for pc video cameras  teksel kyocera for cameras for mobile telephones  welch allyn for cameras for bar code readers  and x for cameras for home entertainment and surveillance cameras 
sales and marketing we sell our products through a direct sales force and indirectly through distributors and manufacturer s representatives 
as of april   our sales and marketing organizations had a total of employees 
we also have independent distributors and manufacturers representatives  four of whom are domestic and of whom are located outside the united states 
we continuously evaluate whether to use a direct sales force or to utilize independent representatives in a particular region or for a given potential customer depending upon the scope of the potential sales opportunities 
sales outside of the united states represented of revenues in fiscal year  of revenues in fiscal year  and of revenues for the fiscal year ended april   or fiscal year sales outside of the united states are primarily denominated in us dollars in order to reduce the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
in fiscal year  we sold our camerachips to camera manufacturers who market camera products under their own brand 
we also sold camerachips to large manufacturing companies that produce camera products for others to market under different brand names 
through our relationships  we have developed expertise in the design of cameras 
we have used that expertise to assist our customers in developing their products which incorporate our camerachips 
we also have provided reference designs and engineering design review and engineering product evaluation testing and debugging services for our customers 
technology we have key technical competencies in analog signal processing design  mixed signal circuit design  advanced cmos camerachip design  automatic testing and single chip semiconductor design 
analog circuit design we have in house expertise to design sophisticated analog semiconductor circuits 
this expertise is unique because most semiconductor design engineers today work in the area of digital circuit design 
our in house expertise has allowed us to process the video data captured in the analog domain  which has many significant advantages over digital processing 
analog processing works directly on the original image signals without the loss of data typical with conversion to digital processing 
analog circuits require considerably less space which means we can design smaller chips with far less noise caused by heat or cross talk than digital circuits 
the image processing circuits take approximately to of the space in our typical camerachip design  leaving to for the image sensing array 
most ccd image sensors and other competitive cmos image sensor products convert the image signal to digital as the very first step and then export the data to another chip for image processing and formatting 
in our digital output product designs  conversion to a digital signal is the last step taken before the output step rather than the first 
analog processing is the key for integrating all the functions on a single chip thereby taking full advantage of the benefits of cmos technology 
analog output designs our analog output camerachips are designed to output a pal or ntsc video signal that can be used directly by standard television equipment without any additional conversion technology 
these camerachips take advantage of the analog processing technology on our digital output chips 
prior to output  the signal is formatted specifically for industry adopted television standards 
there is no digital conversion on our analog output camerachips 
ccd image sensors and other competitive cmos image sensor products that process their images in a digital format must convert their video signal to a standard television format in a separate chip in order to generate the same output  resulting in an increase in complexity  cost and space needed for a product design 
mixed analog digital circuit design we have developed extensive in house expertise in the technology of mixing analog and digital signals in the same semiconductor design without suffering the common problems of interference from noise caused by heat or crosstalk 
we use digital circuits in our camerachips to interface to the outside digital world 
we have developed a method of programming the analog processing circuits which gives our customers extensive and flexible programming capability from digitally based microprocessors and micro controllers 
advanced cmos camerachip design our in house semiconductor design engineers are skilled in the design of high speed  low power and mixed analog digital cmos camerachips 
we use advanced design techniques to develop high speed  highly integrated semiconductors which can be fabricated using standard cmos processes and which can be manufactured using conventional low cost packages 
automatic testing automatic testing methods and equipment designed for conventional cmos devices are not sufficient for testing an image sensor 
in addition to testing all the normal logic and electrical functions  an optical test must be performed on the image sensor 
in our proprietary testing process  the camerachip is turned on and captures a live image  which is subsequently analyzed for quality and color 
our in house expertise has allowed us to design automatic testing equipment  specifically for cmos image sensors 
using low cost commercially available modules and components  we have designed and developed a complete microcomputer based testing system that has automatic handling capability  an image source  a lighting and lens system and automatic output sorting 
this low cost system is programmable so that testing criteria and testing methodology can be easily changed and can be replicated to meet increased production requirements 
the system produces detailed reports on test results that are used for feedback to our quality control and operations department 
single chip semiconductor design our expertise has allowed us to create single chip cmos image sensing devices 
our single chip integrates the image capture  the image processing  the color processing and conversion and output for either television or computers 
research and development the internal design of our cmos camerachips has been done in a modular fashion 
the major functions  such as the image capture  image sensor control logic  color processing  analog output  digital output and programming control  are stand alone circuits that can rapidly be modified or used in new product developments 
as a result  circuit improvements easily migrate to each new product  and the total development time and cost for new products is greatly reduced 
we use a team approach to design new products  which includes a senior design engineer and additional engineers with specific design expertise 
as of april   we had a total of employees in research and development 
we have invested  and expect that we will continue to invest  significant funds in research and development 
our research and development expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year intellectual property our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secrets  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect various aspects of our camerachips such as the image capture and the image processing circuit 
as of april   we have been issued united states patents 
we have also received foreign patents 
we have filed and pending additional united states patent applications  of which two have been allowed 
these patents and patent applications protect the single chip image sensor design  noise reduction and cancellation circuits  image enhancement  color processing  and applications technologies of our semiconductor camerachips 
from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
it is possible that companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
manufacturing wafer fabrication our semiconductor products are fabricated using standard cmos processes  which permit us to engage independent wafer foundries to fabricate our semiconductors 
by outsourcing our manufacturing to semiconductor foundries  we are able to avoid the high cost of owning and operating a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility 
this allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our camerachips 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing to tsmc and psc 
our camerachips are currently fabricated using a standard process at   and microns 
we continue to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to a smaller circuit technology in order to reduce costs or to increase quality and performance 
we have signed agreements with samsung electronics co 
ltd  or samsung  and coasia microelectronics corp  samsung s sales agent  under which samsung fabricates one of our interface chips on its standard fabrication line 
samsung not only fabricates the wafers  but also packages the chips and performs a final test  delivering a final product that can be shipped by coasia microelectronics corp 
directly to our customers when required 
we also purchase selected interface chips from winbond electronics corp  or winbond  for re sale to our customers 
color filter application a majority of our unit sales of camerachips for fiscal year are color camerachips 
these require a color filter to be applied to the wafer before packaging 
this color filter application uses a series of masks to place red  green and blue dyes on the individual picture elements in an industry standard bayer pattern 
as a final step  a micro lens is applied to each picture element 
we outsource the application of our color filters to toppan printing co  ltd 
in japan and to tsmc in taiwan 
assembly after wafer fabrication  and color filter application if required  the wafers are diced into chips  which are then assembled into packages 
our products are designed to use low cost standard packages that are widely in use for optical sensor chips 
these packages have a glass lid to allow light to pass through to the image sensor array 
in fiscal year  we outsourced the majority of our packaging requirements to alphatec semiconductor packaging co  or alphatec  in thailand  pan pacific semiconductor co  ltd  or ppsc  in taiwan  and kyocera in japan 
we continue to evaluate the benefits of using other vendors and other packaging technologies in order to further reduce costs or increase quality or performance 
testing high volume product testing is an important part of the production of camerachips and is a substantial barrier to entry for many companies 
production testing equipment designed for conventional cmos devices is not sufficient for testing image sensors because an optical image must be captured and checked in addition to checking the normal logic and electrical functions 
the few commercially available image sensor testers are expensive and do not meet our high standards 
we have designed our own automatic test equipment  using readily available modules and components 
these testers are computer based and have automatic handling capability  a lighting and lens system  a changeable image source and automatic output sorting by grade 
the system is programmable so that testing criteria and methodology can be changed easily to accommodate new products or special testing requests 
our cost to build a system is substantially less than that of commercially available testers 
we can expand our production capability by building additional systems at a low cost 
current testing capacity is in excess of one million units per month 
our policy is to do a complete optical test of all our camerachips 
currently  substantially all of our testing is done on our testing machines installed at our headquarters facility in sunnyvale  california  although a very small amount of testing for a few older products is done by hand by a third party 
we continue to evaluate the benefits of making our testing machines available to outside vendors who could perform our testing in order to reduce costs 
we use the reports from our testing machines to monitor the cause of any failure in order to place responsibility with the appropriate vendor  ie wafer fabrication  color filter application or packaging and to assist with corrective actions 
since camerachips are optical products  the exposure to impurities is a major concern during the color filter application and packaging process 
we use test data to establish yield goals at each step of the manufacturing process and to take appropriate remedial action 
quality assurance we focus on product quality through all stages of the design and manufacturing process 
our designs are subjected to in depth circuit simulation before being committed to silicon 
test wafers are fabricated and test chips are packaged and live tested before a new product is committed to production 
initial production runs are kept at a minimum until sufficient products have completed the entire manufacturing and testing process and are delivered to and approved by customers 
full production runs are committed at that time 
we qualify each of our vendors through a series of industry standard environmental product stress tests  as well as an audit and an analysis of the subcontractor s quality system and manufacturing capability 
we also participate in quality and reliability monitoring through each stage of the production cycle by reviewing electrical parametric data from our foundries and other subcontractors 
we closely monitor wafer foundry production to obtain consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
competition we compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets are time to market  quality  total system design cost  availability of foundry capacity  customer support and supplier reputation 
our primary competition comes from ccd image sensor manufacturers and multi chip cmos image sensor manufacturers o ccd image sensor manufacturers 
image sensor manufacturers using ccd technology include a number of well established companies  particularly vertically integrated camcorder and high resolution digital still camera manufacturers 
our main competition comes from the top six companies that collectively account for approximately of the total ccd image sensor market  according to the cahners in stat group 
these six companies are fuji  matsushita  nec  sharp  sony  and toshiba 
o multiple chip cmos image sensor manufacturers 
image sensor manufacturers using cmos technology include a number of well established companies such as agilent technologies  inc  st microelectronics  conexant systems  inc  hyundai electronics industries co 
ltd  mitsubishi electronic  motorola  inc  and toshiba corporation 
in addition  we compete with a large number of smaller cmos manufacturers including zoran corporation  or zoran  and ic media corporation 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines  access to large customer bases and longer standing relationships with suppliers and customers than we do 
backlog sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
our backlog includes only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming twelve months 
as of april  and  our backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
although our backlog is typically filled within two to four quarters  our current backlog is subject to changes in delivery schedules and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue 
employees as of april  we had a total of full time employees  located at our headquarters in sunnyvale  california and in foreign sales support offices located in taiwan  china  republic of south korea and japan 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good

item properties our headquarters  including our principal engineering  administrative  marketing and testing facilities  are located in approximately  square feet of space we have leased in sunnyvale  california under a lease expiring april  in december  our subsidiary in shanghai entered into an agreement to lease  square meters of space in shanghai  people s republic of china which will be used for product design and testing 
this agreement expires in december item legal proceedings from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
in march  we received a letter from koninklijke philips nv  or philips  in which philips claimed to have patent rights in a serial bus system for data transmission  known as the ic bus system 
although we do not believe any of our products infringe any philips patent  we have discussed possible royalty or licensing arrangements as a means of business resolution 
in the meantime  we have completed implementation of a new serial bus system for our products 
on november   a complaint captioned mckee v 
omnivision technologies  inc  et 
al  civil action no 
cv  was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against our company  some of our directors and officers  and various underwriters for our initial public offering 
plaintiffs generally allege that the named defendants violated federal securities laws because the prospectus related to our offering failed to disclose  and contained false and misleading statements regarding  certain commissions purported to have been received by the underwriters  and other purported underwriter practices in connection with their allocation of shares in our offering 
substantially similar actions have been filed concerning the initial public offerings for more than different issuers  and the cases have been coordinated as in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc the complaint against us was amended in april  and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between july  and december  we believe that we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and will defend this lawsuit vigorously 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail

there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct 
certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  in the section entitled factors affecting future results in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in this section 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements by or attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we design  develop and market high performance  high quality  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main product  an image sensing device called a camerachip tm  is used to capture an image in cameras and camera related products in high volume imaging applications such as personal computer cameras  digital still cameras  security and surveillance cameras  personal digital assistant cameras and mobile phone cameras and cameras for automobiles and toys for both still picture and live video applications 
our camerachips are designed to use the cmos fabrication process 
our single chip image sensors can allow our customers to build cameras that are smaller  require fewer chips  consume less power and cost less to build than cameras using traditional ccd technology  or multiple chip cmos image sensors 
unlike competitive image sensors  which require multiple chips to achieve the same functions  we are able to integrate nearly all camera functions into a single chip 
this leads us to believe that we supply one of the most highly integrated single chip cmos image sensor solutions 
image sensors are characterized by several important attributes such as picture resolution  color  lens size  voltage requirements and type of video output 
we intend to continue developing new camerachips aimed at new and existing markets 
we plan to expand the range of picture resolutions we offer  provide additional camerachips that require only three volts for portable applications and further improve image quality and integrate additional functions into our image sensor 
in addition  we developed and market an interface chip that connects a camera to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the universal serial bus on personal computers  and we plan to continue to make improvements to that product as well 
our first image sensor was a low resolution  black and white sensor introduced in we introduced an improved version of this sensor in early in addition  we introduced color and digital image sensors in and higher resolution and higher quality image sensors in and for fiscal years  and  the majority of our revenues were generated from sales of our five volt color image sensors 
given the growth of the internet and multimedia applications which allow for digital images to be captured  stored and transported  we expect that a significant portion of our revenues in fiscal year ending april   or fiscal year  will be generated from our five volt color image sensors  which are used primarily in affordable and easy to use personal computer cameras  and increasingly from volt color image sensors which are used in both personal computer cameras and cellular phone accessories 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force and indirectly through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
our image sensors are sold to camera manufacturers who market camera products under their own brand 
we also sell to large manufacturing companies that produce camera products for others to market under different brand names 
we outsource all of our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing to tsmc and psc 
a majority of our unit sales of camerachips for the fiscal year were color image sensors 
these require a color filter to be applied to the wafer before packaging 
we outsource the application of this color filter to toppan and tsmc 
we outsource the packaging of our image sensors to kyocera  ppsc and alphatec 
outside testing services do not offer suitable tests for the key parameter of product performance and image quality 
therefore  we design and produce our own automatic testing equipment specifically for image sensor testing  and we do substantially all of our testing in house 
our control over the testing process helps us maintain consistent product quality and identify areas to improve product quality and reduce costs 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
for certain shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for return or credits  revenue is deferred until the distributor resells the product 
we provide for future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized 
sales of our camerachips are subject to seasonality 
some of the products using our camerachips such as personal computer video cameras and digital still cameras are consumer electronics goods 
typically  these goods are subject to seasonality with generally increased consumer sales in november and december due to the holidays 
as a result  product sales are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year 
in addition  we typically experience a decrease in orders in the quarter ended january from our chinese and taiwanese customers primarily due to the chinese new year 
we intend to maintain our technology leadership by continuing to develop our core technology through our in house research and development efforts 
as a result  we expect that our future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues as we design and develop our next generation of image sensor products during fiscal year in december  we formed a subsidiary to conduct design and testing operations in shanghai  the people s republic of china 
the registered capital of this company is million  of which million was funded by us in the fiscal year ended april   as required by chinese law 
we funded an additional million during fiscal year we are further obligated to fund the remaining million of registered capital by december as of april   million of the million funded to date was paid for land use rights and to building contractors in partial payment for the construction of the facility  million was deposited in a bank account in china and million was expended for general purposes 
the formation and operation of our subsidiary in china requires a large initial capital investment 
also there may be significant administrative  legal and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued governmental barriers in china  which may prevent our ability to begin operation of the subsidiary and prevent us from using the funds outside of china 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o revenue recognition  o allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve  o inventory valuation  o valuation of long lived assets  o accounting for income taxes  and o litigation and contingencies 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors 
we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to our customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is considered probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
for certain shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for return or credits  revenue is deferred until the distributor resells the product 
we provide for future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an on going basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide reserves for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
customer credit worthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and potential sales returns and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable and our sales return reserve represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventory valuation the semiconductor manufacturing industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on first in  first out  or fifo  basis  or market 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next six months 
these reserves are associated with specific inventory items and will be relieved when specific inventory is scrapped or sold 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
in fiscal year  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in the pc cameras market  the demand for certain color camerachips did not meet our expectations 
therefore  we recorded an million charge for excess inventories in fiscal year valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires us to review for impairment of our long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
when such an event occurs  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  no impairment loss has been recognized 
we assess the impairment in value to our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant negative industry trends  o significant underutilization of the assets  and o significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
on may   sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets became effective 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
and requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
our adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets of million and million at april  and  respectively 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our results of operations are reported as a single business segment 
year ended april  statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative stock compensation charge litigation settlement total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss results of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and revenues 
we derive revenues from the sale of our camerachip products and other companion circuits for use in a variety of applications 
revenues for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
revenues decreased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year from fiscal year to fiscal year  revenues from pc camera sales declined by an estimated million as a result of a decrease in the number of pc camera units sold due in large part to the customer inventory build up that occurred in the october through november time frame 
the effect of this decline was partially offset by an estimated million increase in security camera revenues and by an estimated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million increase in digital still camera revenues 
revenues increased million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily as a result of greater demand for pc cameras and security and surveillance cameras 
domestic and international revenues for fiscal year were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  for fiscal year and million and million  respectively  for fiscal year for fiscal year  one of our distributors  world peace  represented approximately of revenues and one of our camera manufacturer customers  x  accounted for approximately of revenues 
for fiscal year  world peace represented approximately of revenues and one of our camera manufacturer customers  creative  accounted for approximately of revenues 
for fiscal year  world peace represented approximately of total revenues and two of our camera manufacturer customers  creative and alaris  accounted for approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
no other distributor or camera manufacturer customer accounted for or more of total revenues in fiscal years  and gross profit loss 
gross margins for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
gross margins during fiscal year included an approximately million one time benefit from the sale of inventory that was previously written off in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recognized an million charge for excess inventory 
excluding the benefit of previously written off inventory  the adjusted gross margin for fiscal year was of revenues as compared to adjusted gross margin of and of revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins on an adjusted basis for fiscal year was due to favorable changes in product mix and yield improvements on certain products 
the decrease in gross margins from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to an million charge for excess inventory that we recognized in fiscal year the increase in gross margins on an adjusted basis from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to modest yield improvements resulting from higher capacity utilization and favorable changes in product mix 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses and costs for purchased materials  designs and tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of computer aided design software 
research and development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal years  and  research and development expenses represented  and of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses increased on an absolute dollar and percentage of revenue basis due primarily to lower revenue levels on a year to year basis and increases in salaries  payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel  and contracted costs associated with new product development 
our research and development expenses for fiscal year increased at a rate proportionately greater than revenues 
research and development expenses increased for fiscal year due to increases in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel  contracted costs associated with new product development  software installation and expenses related to the application for new patents 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of our product development cycles 
we expect that our future research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues as we design and develop our next generation of camerachips 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses and commissions paid to distributors and manufacturers representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
for fiscal years  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year was due principally to approximately million in increased litigation expenses associated with patent litigation  an increase of million in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel  and an increase of million associated with sales activities in asia 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute dollar basis in fiscal year by approximately million due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel  an increase in commissions paid to distributors and manufacturers representatives  and increased legal expenses associated with legal actions resulting from infringement claims by photobit corporation  or photobit  and the california institute of technology  or cal tech and accounting costs associated with business development and operations 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year resulted from expenses that increased at a rate greater than the rate of increase in revenues 
as a result of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our recent settlement of certain intellectual property claims  we expect that our future selling  general and administrative expenses may decrease in absolute dollars and are likely to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
stock compensation charge 
we incurred stock compensation charges of approximately million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of april   deferred compensation totaled approximately million and represents the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of stock options to purchase our common stock on the date of grant  is amortized on an accelerated basis as the options vest 
deferred compensation charges of million as of april  are to be amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock options of generally five years 
stock option exchange program 
on november   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  our employees were given the opportunity to elect to cancel outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of new options to be granted on june  the exchange program was not available to our executives  directors or any of our employees who live or work outside the united states 
these elections were required to be made by december  on june   we issued options to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on june  we did not record any compensation expenses associated with this exchange program 
litigation settlement 
litigation settlement expense for fiscal year amounted to million 
the litigation settlement expense for fiscal year was due to a one time payment of million to photobit  to settle all pending litigation that we had with photobit and caltech 
as a percentage of revenues  litigation settlement expenses for fiscal year  and represented  zero and zero  respectively 
interest income  net 
interest income  net for fiscal years and was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest income and interest expense  net  decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily due to a decline in interest rates 
these funds are invested in interest bearing accounts consisting primarily of high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately twelve months or less from the date of purchase 
interest income  net for fiscal year was minor because our cash balances were minor prior to our initial public offering of common stock in july provision for income taxes 
we generated losses before income taxes in fiscal years and and therefore had no provision for income taxes in those periods 
we generated approximately million in operating profits for the fiscal year and had a provision for income taxes amounting to  after taking into consideration the utilization of the prior years net operating loss carryforwards and credits 
recent accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  approved its statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 or sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  all business combinations should be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  use of the pooling of interests  or pooling  method is prohibited 
the provisions of the statement will apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
will apply to all acquired intangible assets whether acquired singly  as part of a group  or in a business combination 
the statement will supersede accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
 intangible assets  and will carry forward provisions in apb opinion no 
related to internally developed intangible assets 
adoption of sfas no 
will result in ceasing amortization of goodwill 
we will adopt sfas no 
effective may  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
it establishes a single accounting method  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
we are currently assessing  but have not yet determined  the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our growth principally through sales of common stock and private sales of equity securities  totaling approximately million 
principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our working capital decreased by million to million as of april  from million as of april  the decrease primarily was attributable to an million decrease in inventories due principally to an improvement in inventory turnover and a reduction in inventory levels consistent with the decline in revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  net 
our decreased working capital was also attributable to a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  combined with a million increase in accounts payable and a million decrease in short term investments 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million as compared to our use of cash for operating activities of million in fiscal year  primarily due to an million reduction in inventories  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  which was partially offset by a net loss of million for fiscal year as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year  and a million increase in accounts receivable 
for fiscal year  our use of cash for operating activities was approximately million from cash provided of million in fiscal year  primarily due to a net loss of million in fiscal year as compared to net income of million for fiscal year  a million decrease in accounts payable and a million increase in refundable and deferred income taxes partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable combined with a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities and a net  decrease in inventory including the recognition of an million charge for excess inventory 
for fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
for fiscal year  our use of cash in investing activities decreased to approximately million from a use of approximately million for fiscal year  due to million in purchases of property  plant and equipment combined with a reduction of approximately million in purchases of short term investments  partially offset by million in proceeds from sales of short term investments 
for fiscal year  our use of cash for investing activities increased to approximately million from a use of million in fiscal year  due to million in net purchases of short term investments combined with million in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used for investing activities for fiscal year resulted from purchases of property  plant and equipment 
our net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year and  for fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year resulted principally from issuance and sale of common stock from employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan and exercises under employee stock option plans 
in fiscal year we received approximately million in aggregate net proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo 
ipo proceeds resulted from the issuance and sale in fiscal year of  shares of common stock and the issuance and sale of an additional  shares of common stock following the exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option 
net cash provided from financing activities for fiscal year resulted from the issuance and sale of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options during the year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued based on our current working capital position and the cash flows that we expect to generate  we believe these cash resources will be sufficient to meet our capital and investment requirements  including anticipated capital expenditures in the amount of approximately million and anticipated investment expenditures of approximately million associated with the subsidiary that we have formed in china  and other potential investments  for at least the next months 
after this period  capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  costs of establishing and maintaining our chinese subsidiary  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  product yields  average selling price of our products  and increases in our operating expenses 
to the extent that existing cash resources are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us or to our shareholders 
in the event that we do raise additional cash through financings  current investors could be further diluted 
from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of business  products or technologies that complement our business 
although we have no current plans in this regard  any transactions  if consummated  may consume a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of securities that may result in further dilution to existing stockholders 
related party transactions frank huang  a former director of our company who resigned in may  is the chairman of the board of directors of powerchip semiconductor corp  or powerchip  a joint venture between umax group and mitsubishi electrical corporation 
mr 
huang is also the chairman of the board of directors of umax group 
in march  we entered into a foundry agreement with powerchip pursuant to which we purchase semiconductor wafers from powerchip 
our total purchases from powerchip were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe these transactions were on terms no less favorable than we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
in addition  powerchip owns  shares of our common stock

  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in december  we formed a wholly owned cayman islands subsidiary  hua wei technology international  ltd  or hua wei 
in december  hua wei formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  hua wei semiconductor shanghai co  ltd  or hua wei semiconductor  to conduct design and testing operations 
the registered capital of hua wei semiconductor is million  of which million was funded by us in the fiscal year ended april   as required by chinese law 
we funded an additional million during fiscal year we are further obligated to fund the remaining million of registered capital by december as of april   million of the million funded to date was paid for land use rights and to building contractors in partial payment for the construction of the facility  million was deposited in a bank account in china and million was expended for general purposes 
in connection with the formation of hua wei  we purchased  shares of hua wei s common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  as of july   we anticipate granting to certain of our employees options to purchase approximately  of hua wei s common stock 
one half of the shares underlying each of these options vested as of june  and th of such shares shall vest on the last day of each month thereafter 
the exercise price of these options shall be 
we anticipate that in the second quarter of fiscal year we will grant an option to purchase  of these shares to shaw hong  an option to purchase  of these shares to raymond wu  an option to purchase  of these shares to h 
gene mccown  an option to purchase  of these shares to qi dong and an option to purchase  of these shares to xinping he 
factors affecting future results you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 
we have a history of losses  we were only profitable on an annual basis in fiscal year and we may not ever return to profitability on an annual basis 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for the year ended april   the only year in which we have been profitable  our net income was approximately million 
in the future  as we develop new products  we expect research and development expenses to increase 
also  as we hire additional personnel and possibly engage in larger business transactions  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase 
we will also incur substantial noncash charges relating to the amortization of unearned compensation 
if these expenses increase and our revenues do not increase  we may not subsequently sustain profitability 
the recent economic slowdown and other economic conditions have reduced and may continue to reduce our revenues and to harm our business 
since the third quarter of fiscal year  our customers and distributors  primarily our pc video camera customers and distributors  have been impacted by significantly lower demand for camera related products  which forced them to unexpectedly reschedule or cancel orders for our products in recent quarters 
as a result  our revenues and earnings were adversely affected 
in june  we announced projected revenues and earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year if demand for camera related products  in particular pc video cameras  does not recover in the first quarter of fiscal year  or if we are unable to manage our operating expenses  we will not be able to meet these projections 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may not adequately forecast the number of wafers we need  and therefore we may not be able to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could result in higher operating expenses and lower revenues 
we must forecast the number of wafers we need from each of our foundries 
however  if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders  we may retain excess wafer inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders  which could result in lower revenues and could harm our relationship with key customers 
for example  as a consequence of a product order forecast which proved to be greater than market demand for our products  we recognized an million inventory adjustment in fiscal year if we do not achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  our costs could increase  and our products may not be deliverable which could lead to higher operating expenses and lower revenues and could damage our customer relationships 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the particular foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products 
yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual image sensor is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
we only test our products after they are assembled  as their optical nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
the risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely on third party offshore foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if the foundries cannot achieve the planned yields  this will result in higher costs and reduced product availability 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance and may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors related to how we manage our business 
these factors  many of which are more fully discussed in other risk factors  include o our ability to manage our product transitions  o our ability to accurately forecast the number of wafers we need  o our ability to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  o the mix of the products we sell and the distribution channels through which they are sold  and o the availability of production capacities at the semiconductor foundries that manufacture our products or components of our products 
in the past  our introduction of new products and our product mix have affected our quarterly operating results 
we also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our expenses and inventory levels are based on our expectations of future revenues and our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  if revenues in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially future quarters  may be harmed 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain other factors have in the past caused and are likely in the future to cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these factors are industry risks over which we have little or no control 
these factors include o the growth of the market for products and applications using cmos image sensors  o the timing and amount of orders from our camera manufacturers and distributor customers  o the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products  designs or enhancements by us or our competitors  and o the announcement and introduction of products and technologies by our competitors 
any one or more of these factors is difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
due to the potential volatility of our stock price  you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that at some point our quarterly operating results will fall below the expectations of security analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers  and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand  which could lead to excess inventory and lost revenue opportunities 
our sales are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products which we may not be able to sell or we may have to sell our products to other customers for lower prices 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
for example  one customer  creative  unexpectedly cancelled its purchase orders for one of our products in the second quarter of fiscal year which resulted in our shipping substantially fewer quantities to them in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and contributed to a higher than expected inventory position 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable  we may forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
we depend on the acceptance of cmos technology for mass market image sensor applications  and any delay in the widespread acceptance of this technology could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings 
our business strategy depends on the rapid and widespread adoption of the cmos fabrication process for image sensors and the acceptance of our single chip technology 
the image sensor market has been dominated by ccd technology for over years 
although cmos technology has been available for over years  cmos technology has only recently been used in image sensors 
along with the other risk factors described in this section  the following factors may delay the widespread adoption of the cmos fabrication process and our single chip technology  the occurrence of any of which could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and earnings o the failure of the emergence of a universal platform for imaging solutions for computers and the internet  o improvements or cost reductions to ccd image sensors  which could slow the adoption of cmos image sensors in markets already dominated by ccd image sensors  such as the security and surveillance market 
o the failure of development of user friendly and affordable products  and o the limited availability of bandwidth to run cmos image sensor applications  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o the uncertainty of emerging markets for products incorporating cmos technology 
we depend on third party vendors for color filter processing and assembly  which reduces our control over delivery schedules  product quality and cost 
after our wafers are produced  they are color filter processed and assembled by six independent vendors tsmc and toppan for the color filtering process and kyocera and alphatec for additional processing and assembly 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these vendors and typically obtain services from them on a purchase order basis 
our reliance on these vendors involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or could increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
if these vendors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide color filter processing and assembly services and deliver products of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our business would be seriously harmed 
we would also have to identify and qualify substitute vendors  which could be time consuming and difficult and result in unforeseen operations problems 
we depend on a limited number of third party wafer foundries to manufacture a substantial majority of our products  which reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we rely on tsmc and psc to produce a substantial majority of our wafers and final products 
our reliance on these third party foundries involves a number of significant risks  including o reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  o lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  and o unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies 
we do not have long term supply agreements with any of our foundries and instead secure manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
these foundries have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacities of these foundries and tsmc or psc may reallocate capacity to other customers  even during periods of high demand for our products 
if any of our foundries were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs and in a timely manner  our business would be seriously harmed 
as a result  we would have to identify and qualify substitute foundries  which would be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  our product costs may increase  and we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to manufacturing services 
we are also exposed to additional risks if we decide to transfer our production of semiconductors from one foundry to another 
we may qualify additional foundries in the future which is a time consuming and difficult process that could result in unforeseen product or operation problems 
if we do not qualify additional foundries  we may be exposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our complete dependence on our foundries 
our lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly cycle  in addition to our customers design cycle  may result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues 
a lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly process  typically lasting four months or more  is required to manufacture our image sensors 
it can take additional time before a customer commences volume shipments of products that incorporate our image sensors 
even when a manufacturer decides to design our image sensors into its products  the manufacturer may never ship final products incorporating our image sensors 
given this lengthy cycle  we experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures for research and development  and sales and marketing efforts and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
as a result  our revenues and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued profits could be seriously harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays orders or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
if the demand for our products in current markets and emerging markets fails to increase as we anticipate  our growth prospects would be diminished 
our success depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets that use our products and the emergence of new markets for our products 
the current markets that use our products include digital still cameras  personal computer cameras  personal digital assistant cameras  mobile phone cameras  cameras for security and surveillance systems  closed circuit television systems  cameras for toys and games and automotive applications 
emerging markets for our products include cameras for personal identification systems  medical imaging devices  machine control systems  and videophones 
if these markets do not continue to grow and develop  the need for cameras which are lower in cost  smaller  lighter in weight  consume less power and are more reliable might not fully develop 
in such case  it would be unlikely that our products would achieve commercial success 
failure to obtain design wins could cause our revenues to level off or decline 
our future success will depend on camera manufacturers designing our image sensors into their systems 
to achieve design wins  which are decisions by those manufacturers to design our products into their systems  we must define and deliver cost effective  innovative and integrated semiconductor solutions 
once a manufacturer has designed a supplier s products into its systems  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  the failure to achieve design wins with key camera manufacturers could decrease our market share or revenues 
declines in our average sales prices may result in declines in our gross margins 
because the image sensor market is characterized by intense competition  and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points  we expect to experience market driven pricing pressures 
this will likely result in a decline in average sales prices for many of our products 
we believe that we can offset declining average sales prices by achieving manufacturing cost efficiencies  developing new products that incorporate more advanced technology and including more advanced features that can be sold at stable average gross margins 
however  if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions and technological advances  or are unable to timely introduce new products  we will lose revenues and gross margins will decline 
seasonality in our business will cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period and could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline 
sales of our image sensors are subject to seasonality 
some of the products using our image sensors such as personal computer video cameras and digital still cameras are consumer electronics goods 
typically  these goods are subject to seasonality with generally increased consumer sales in november and december due to the holidays 
as a result  product sales are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the calendar year 
in addition  we typically experience a decrease in orders in the quarter ended january from our chinese and taiwanese customers primarily due to the chinese new year 
as a result  we believe product sales are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each calendar year 
we depend on a few key customers and distributors  and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors has accounted for a significant portion of our product revenues 
for fiscal year  one of our distributors  world peace represented approximately of revenues and one of our camera manufacturer customers  x  accounted for approximately of revenues 
for item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year  world peace represented approximately of revenues and one of our camera manufacturer customers  creative  accounted for approximately of revenues 
a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from our key customers or distributors  or a decision by them to select or distribute products manufactured by a competitor could seriously harm our business 
for example  in  we had to replace one of our largest distributors with wintek electronics co  ltd 
because that distributor decided to distribute a competitor s products 
we expect our operating results to continue to depend on sales to or design decisions of a relatively small number of distributors and camera manufacturers 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our products  and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business  in particular  the manufacturing  processing and assembly of our products  is conducted outside of the united states  and as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
many of our customers are camera manufacturers or are the manufacturers or suppliers for camera manufacturers and are located in japan  korea  singapore and taiwan 
in addition  sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal year  of our revenues for fiscal year and of our revenues for fiscal year we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to foreign risks  including o difficulties in managing distributors  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o difficulties in managing foundries and third party manufacturers  o political and economic instability which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in asia  o inadequacy of local infrastructure  in particular with respect to our future expansion in china  o longer payment cycles  o the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade  and o difficulties in accounts receivable collections 
in addition  camera manufacturers who design our solutions into their products sell them outside of the united states 
this exposes us indirectly to foreign risks 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenues and profitability in that country 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
our dependence on selling through distributors increases the complexity of our business which may increase our operating costs and may reduce our ability to forecast revenues 
our revenues depend on design wins with new camera manufacturers which  in turn  rely on third party manufacturers or distributors to provide inventory management and purchasing functions 
selling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to o manage a more complex supply chain  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o manage the level of inventory at each distributor  o provide for credits  return rights and price protection  o estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and o monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors 
any failure to manage these challenges could reduce our revenues and damage our relationships with our distributors 
we face intense competition in our markets from more established ccd image sensor manufacturers and cmos image sensor manufacturers and if we are unable to compete successfully  we will not achieve our financial objectives 
the image sensor market is intensely competitive 
these markets are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and decreasing prices 
our current products face competition from a number of sources including companies which sell charged couple device image sensors as well as other companies which sell multiple chip cmos image sensors 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to large customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their product than we may 
our competition includes ccd image sensor manufacturers  including fuji corporation  or fuji  matsushita electric industrial  or matsushita  nippon electric corporation or nec  sharp corporation  or sharp  sony corporation  or sony  and toshiba corporation  or toshiba  as well as cmos image sensor manufacturers such as agilent technologies  inc  st microelectronics  conexant systems  inc  hyundai electronics industries co 
ltd  mitsubishi electronic  motorola  inc  and toshiba corporation 
in addition  there are a large number of smaller startup companies including photobit corporation and zoran corporation  which may or do compete with us 
in particular  hyundai and agilent technologies have introduced multiple chip cmos image sensors 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully against current or potential competitors  or that competition will not seriously harm our business by reducing sales of our products  reducing our profits and reducing our market share 
our success depends on the development and introduction of new products  which we may not be able to do in a timely manner because the process of developing products using cmos image sensors is complex and costly 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products on several occasions in the past  some of which exceeded six months 
as our products integrate new and more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design and debug 
successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors  including o accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including pixel resolution  output interface standards  power requirements  optical lens size  input standards and operating systems for personal computers and other platforms  o development of advanced technologies and capabilities  o definition of new products which satisfy customer requirements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o timely completion and introduction of new product designs  o use of leading edge foundry processes and achievement of high manufacturing yields  and o market acceptance of the new products 
accomplishing all of this is extremely challenging  time consuming and expensive 
we cannot assure you that any new products or product enhancements will be developed in time to capture market opportunities or achieve a significant or sustainable level of acceptance in new and existing markets 
the high level of complexity and integration of functions of our products increases the risk of latent defects which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
because we integrate many functions on a single chip  our products are complex 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of our products  the greater the risk that latent defects or subtle faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of product have been shipped 
although we test our products  they may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
we maintain a backlog of customer orders which is subject to cancellation or delay in delivery schedules  and any cancellation or delay may result in lower than anticipated revenues 
we manufacture and market primarily standard products 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming months 
although our backlog is typically filled within two to four quarters  orders constituting our current backlog are subject to cancellation or changes in delivery schedules  and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue 
in addition  the current backlog will not necessarily lead to revenues in any future period 
any cancellation or delay in orders which constitute our current or future backlog may result in lower than expected revenues 
our bookings visibility continues to be limited with a substantial majority of our quarterly product revenues coming from orders that are received and fulfilled in the same quarter 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful  and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our key management  technical and sales personnel  many of who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of one or more of these employees could seriously harm our business 
we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we have no agreements which obligate our employees to continue working for us 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical particularly analog or mixed signal design engineers  sales  marketing  finance and management personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in silicon valley  california 
this is due to a number of factors  including the high concentration of established and emerging growth technology companies 
this competition makes it difficult to retain our key personnel and to recruit new qualified personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and therefore we may lose some of our competitive advantage 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will issue as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property  which could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
in march  we received a letter from koninklijke philips nv in which philips claimed to have patent rights in a serial bus system for data transmission  known as the ic bus system 
although we do not believe any of our products infringe any philips patent  we are currently discussing possible royalty or licensing arrangements as a means of business resolution 
in the meantime  we have completed implementation of a new serial bus system for our products 
we entered into an agreement with photobit corporation photobit and the california institute of technology caltech  effective september   to settle all litigation that we had with photobit and caltech  including an action in the us district court  northern district of california  case no 
c pjh  and an investigation before the us international trade commission itc  inv 
no 
ta both actions involved patents alleged to pertain to our cmos image sensor products  such as those used in digital cameras  pc cameras and other optical applications 
the action pending in california was dismissed on september   and final termination of the itc investigation occurred on november  the confidential settlement includes non exclusive cross licenses for seven years under our and photobit s respective patent portfolios  including patents and applications licensed by caltech to photobit 
we have also made a one time payment to photobit of million dollars 
the settlement agreement referred to in the above paragraph relates only to claims made by photobit and caltech 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
failure to effectively manage our growth could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things o implement and improve operational and financial systems  o train and manage our employee base  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners and other third parties  such as our foundries and process and assembly vendors 
moreover  our growth may significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other resources 
we also cannot assure you that we have made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion 
in addition  our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development and administrative support 
our investment in a chinese entity to conduct design and testing operations may not reduce our design and testing costs nor improve our gross margins and as a result our earnings would be adversely affected 
in december  we formed a subsidiary to conduct design and testing operations in shanghai  the people s republic of china 
the registered capital of this company is million  of which million was funded by us in the fiscal year ended april   as required by chinese law 
we funded an additional million during fiscal year we are further obligated to fund the remaining million of registered capital by december as of april   million of the million funded to date was paid for land use rights and to building contractors in partial payment for the construction of the facility  million was deposited in a bank account in china and million was expended for general purposes 
the formation and operation of this chinese subsidiary requires a large initial capital investment  and there may be significant administrative  legal and governmental barriers in china  which may prevent or harm us from beginning operation of this chinese subsidiary as well as using the funds outside of china 
we cannot be sure that our investment in our chinese subsidiary will eventually result in the reduction of our design and testing costs 
the formation and operation of our chinese subsidiary requires a large initial capital investment and will also require significant future capital investment as we continue to maintain and upgrade our facility 
in addition  the design and testing of our products is a highly complex  sensitive and precise process which is subject to a wide variety of factors  any number of which could result in an increase of our costs 
if our design and testing costs fail to decrease as a result of our investment in our china subsidiary our earnings may be adversely affected 
the incorporation  formation and development of our chinese subsidiary has resulted and will continue to result in the diversion of capital away from other business issues  as the operation of our design and testing facility will require that we constantly upgrade our technology to remain competitive 
the incorporation  formation and development of our chinese subsidiary has also resulted in the diversion of management s attention away from other business issues 
if our ongoing investment in the chinese subsidiary does not result in offsetting gains in the form of design and testing improvements accompanied by reduced design and testing costs  whether because of the risks and difficulties entailed by foreign operations or for other reasons  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  as well as our stockholders rights plan  could prevent or delay a change in control of us and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include o adjusting the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of preferred stock without stockholder approval  o providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  o requiring supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued o limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and o prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent another company from acquiring or merging with us 
our board of directors adopted a preferred stock rights agreement in august the rights agreement 
pursuant to the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right a right to purchase one one thousandth share of our series a participating preferred stock series a preferred for each outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on september  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one thousandth of a share of series a preferred at an exercise price of  subject to adjustment 
the exercise of the rights could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the rights agreement could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control  that may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  o changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  o release of lock up or the transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock or sales of additional shares of common stock  o changes in market valuations of other technology companies  and o announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our stock for a profit 
in addition  the stock market experiences extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations and any interruption of our power supply could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage in california  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below one and one half percent  the state of california has in the past implemented  and may in the future implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customers or distributors may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our ability to continue operations at our facilities  then our reputation could be damaged  our ability to retain existing customers could be harmed and we could fail to obtain new customers 
these interruptions could also result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in by the california state government has caused power prices to increase 
under deregulation  utilities were encouraged to sell their plants  which traditionally had produced most of california s power  to independent energy companies that were expected to compete aggressively on price 
instead  due in part to a shortage of supply  wholesale prices skyrocketed 
if wholesale energy prices increase in the future  our operating expenses will likely increase  as our us facilities are located in california 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility could lead to substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the semiconductor industry and other technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management s attention and resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are an international company  selling our products globally and  in particular in china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products  gross profits realized  and results of operations 
further  we incur expenses in japan  korea  taiwan  thailand  china and other countries that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we cannot estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our future operating results or cash flows as a direct result of changes in exchange rates 
however  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk  and we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments 
quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in short term bank market rate accounts  certificates of deposit issued by banks  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value or our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates
