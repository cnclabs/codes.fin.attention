item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we market our products and services in three solutions groups software applications  trading community management  and global services 
our software applications allow for automated data synchronization  collaborative sourcing and supply  financial order management  international logistics and customs management  collaborative planning and online merchandising 
our software applications include both enterprise applications installed on customers computer systems as well as hosted applications installed on our computer systems 
our trading community management solutions allow retailers and their trading partners to exchange electronic business documents such as purchase orders  invoices  advanced shipping notices  as well as collaborative business processes  thus eliminating paper  mail delays  and keypunch data errors as these electronic business documents are integrated to the trading partner s accounting and inventory systems 
our global services include the collection  analysis and delivery of information  such as pricing and operational merchandising metrics  for use in strategic and tactical decision making  software implementation and integration services  retail solutions consulting  and technical support and training services for our various solutions 
during the first three quarters of  we identified two reportable segments as defined by sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information tradeweave message exchange  content and related services and tradeweave collaboration and related services 
we evaluated performance and allocated resources based on revenues and operating earnings loss  which includes allocated corporate general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and customer support and information delivery expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  under the leadership of our new management  we realigned our products and services into three solutions groups trading community management  software applications  and global services 
we track revenues and cost of revenues from each of these solutions groups and such amounts have been disclosed on the face of the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not operate these products and services as separate businesses nor do we evaluate their profitability below the gross profit line 
we now operate in one business segment we provide supply chain management solutions to the retail industry 
for reconciliation purposes  we have included the following table that shows our former reportable segments and the service and product names included therein as set forth in last year s annual report on form k along with the current service and product names and their respective solutions groups 
former reportable segment and service or product name current service or product name solutions group tradeweave collaboration and related services tradeweave sourcing qrs sourcing software applications tradeweave merchandise and collaborative planning qrs merchandising software applications tradeweave showroom qrs showroom software applications tradeweave logistics services software applications tradeweave sales inventory analysis software applications tradeweave professional services qrs professional services global services tradeweave message exchange  catalog and related services tradeweave data exchange messaging qrs exchange tradeweave community management tradeweave remote access qrs access services tradeweave community management tradeweave vendor messaging web forms tradeweave community management tradeweave service bureau managed ec tradeweave community management tradeweave product catalog qrs catalogue software applications tradeweave retail intelligence qrs retail intelligence services global services tradeweave digital photography global services as announced in december  some of the functionality of these products will be incorporated into qrs sourcing product and they will no longer be sold as a stand alone product after mid the tradeweave digital photography service was discontinued in september see note to consolidated financial statements 
revenues and cost of revenue the following table sets forth the revenues  cost of revenues  gross profit loss and gross margins loss for our three solution groups for the years ended december   and in thousands and associated headcount information at december   and years ended december  trading community management revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross margin software applications revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross margin global services revenues    cost of revenues    gross loss profit    gross margin loss total revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross margin full time headcount for customer support  operations and services at year end part time headcount  primarily for qrs retail intelligence services  at year end  includes the reductions in revenues and cost of revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in connection with our adoption of eitf accounting for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products see note to consolidated financial statements 
results include a million impairment loss associated with the write off of capitalized service and product development costs for qrs showroom see note to consolidated financial statements 
results include a million impairment loss associated with the write down of property and equipment associated with tradeweave digital photography services see note to consolidated financial statements 
trading community management the trading community management solutions group formerly tradeweave message exchange incorporates technology and service components of several qrs exchange products internet transaction exchange  enterprise business exchange  data exchange  web forms  managed ec and access services 
revenues consist primarily of fees charged for the transmission of standard business documents measured in kilocharacters kcs over the ibm van  monthly fees for leased line connections  and service fees to convert documents from paper into electronic format 
revenues are recognized in the month that the services are performed 
revenues have been declining for these services due primarily to price competition which has caused us from time to time to reduce prices on these services 
if we are forced to effect further price reductions in connection with such increased competition  such reductions would reduce net sales in future periods to the extent not offset by increased unit sales or other factors 
as the industry continues to adopt existing and new information technologies  we expect competition and pricing pressures to increase 
price reductions in response to competitive pressures and customer defection for lower prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an additional factor is that in  we also changed the way we charge fees for sending and receiving catalog documents over the network that had the effect of reducing qrs exchange revenues and increasing qrs catalogue revenues 
as a result of these factors  trading community management revenues declined million  or  from to and million  or  from to as revenues decline for the reasons discussed above  our costs remain relatively fixed under our network services agreement with ibm where we have a minimum purchase commitment  regardless of our resale levels  in exchange for lower pricing per unit of usage 
this contract began in and expires at the end of prior to  our agreement was based on usage with the cost per unit declining as volumes increased and included substantial penalties if certain purchase commitments were not met 
we saw our costs of revenue decline in from by million  or  primarily because of cost savings we realized under this contract as a result of the change in terms 
additional trading community management cost of revenue components are customer support services  including managed ec personnel  allocated costs for our data center and other technical support personnel  as well as amortization of capitalized service and product development costs for technology used in our managed ec outsourcing centers 
the increase in cost of revenues from to of million  or  reflects increased data center and technical customer support services and additional managed ec outsourcing center personnel costs  offset by a decrease in purchased network services 
the declining revenues have produced declining gross margins from in to in and because of the fixed cost nature of our ibm agreement and increasing price competition  we expect to experience further gross margin pressure in the future 
included in trading community management revenues are services we provided to kmart and its trading partners 
if kmart emerges from its chapter xi bankruptcy proceeding as a smaller company or is not able to successfully reorganize and ceases to exist  revenues from kmart and its trading partners  which represent less than of trading community management revenues  would be substantially decreased or lost 
software applications software applications solutions group includes the qrs catalogue formerly tradeweave product catalog  a hosted application which was introduced in  enterprise software applications  including qrs sourcing that was acquired in march and qrs merchandising that was acquired in january  and other hosted software applications  including qrs showroom that was launched in april  as well as tradeweave logistics and tradeweave sales and inventory analysis which were both introduced in we will discontinue selling tradeweave logistics and tradeweave sales and inventory analysis as stand alone products in mid and will include relevant portions of their functionality in our qrs sourcing product 
the following table sets forth the revenues  cost of revenues  gross profit loss and gross margins loss for our software application categories for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  qrs catalogue revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross margin enterprise software applications revenues   cost of revenues gross profit   gross margin other hosted software applications revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit loss    gross loss margin total software applications revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross margin results include a million impairment loss associated with the write off of capitalized service and product development costs for qrs showroom see note to the consolidated financial statements 
qrs catalogue revenues have grown throughout the reporting period  increasing million  or  from to  and million  or  from to the increase is primarily attributable to increased usage by our core customer base as well as a change we made in the way we charge fees for sending and receiving catalog documents over the network that had the effect of reducing qrs exchange revenues and increasing qrs catalogue revenues 
the increase was also due to expanded usage by our core customer base combined with the effect of a revised pricing structure 
cost of revenues for qrs catalogue consist primarily of customer and technical support personnel  allocated costs of our data center and  starting in  purchased network services to transmit catalog data to and from our data center 
in  our cost of catalogue revenues grew million  or  which was faster than our revenues growth  primarily due to additional purchased network services costs associated with the increased revenues we recognized when we changed the way we charge fees for sending and receiving catalog documents over the network 
there were also additional allocated costs of our data center and additional customer support infrastructure to support expanding qrs catalogue rollouts 
in  we experienced a decrease in our qrs catalogue cost of revenues of million  or  despite an increase in revenues  producing a significant increase in gross margin 
this cost decline is attributable to the decrease in the cost of purchased network services as a result of our revised ibm contract effective january   use of alternative technologies to transmit data to and from the network  as well as cost savings from customer and technical support headcount reductions during the first quarter of we do not expect these gross margins to improve further in due to an increase in data center costs allocated to the qrs catalogue as we phase out certain other hosted applications in mid  as well as increased costs as we open customer support centers in europe 
enterprise software applications was a new product category for us in after we acquired image info inc image info in january and rockport trade systems  inc rockport in march  through which we obtained our qrs merchandising and qrs sourcing products  respectively 
in  revenues increased by  or  to million during difficult economic conditions 
we believe enterprise software applications is an area that offers significant growth opportunities for the company 
historically  we have not capitalized software development costs under sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed because technological feasibility has been reached at substantially the same time as products have been released for sale 
therefore  there is no amortization of capitalized product and service development costs included in the cost of revenues for enterprise software applications 
as a result  cost of revenues for enterprise software applications are comprised of personnel and related costs for custom software development contracts  as well as media and shipping  and product documentation  which is provided online 
as the volume of enterprise software applications transactions increases  we expect gross margins to decline somewhat from the levels reported for and other hosted applications include qrs showroom that was initially launched in april  and tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics that were introduced in revenues from these products steadily decreased during and  declining  or  from to and  or in the decrease in revenues is attributable to the fact that our tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics products are being phased out and their relevant functionalities will be developed into our enterprise software applications in mid revenues for our qrs showroom product were de minimus in and cost of revenues for other hosted software applications consists primarily of allocated costs of our data center  amortization of capitalized product and service development costs  including additional charges in related to the write off of capitalized costs for qrs showroom  and customer and technical support personnel 
the increase in cost of revenues for other hosted software applications of million  or  from to is primarily the result of significant costs incurred to introduce the qrs showroom product 
these costs were principally personnel related  along with amortization of capitalized product and service development costs 
cost of revenues for other hosted software applications decreased by million  or  from to due to the february restructuring efforts that substantially reduced the personnel and facility expenses for the qrs showroom product  restructuring efforts that reduced customer and technical support personnel for tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics  and reduced data center costs 
these savings were offset by a million write off of capitalized product and service development costs related to the qrs showroom product during the fourth quarter of as the result of an impairment analysis see note to consolidated financial statements 
global services global services solutions group consists primarily of qrs retail intelligence services  which we acquired in from retail data services  inc rds  qrs professional services and maintenance  including implementation and post contract support services for licensed software applications which we obtained when we acquired rockport in the first quarter of  and tradeweave digital photography  which we obtained when we acquired image info in january we discontinued tradeweave digital photography services in september due to underperformance 
global services revenues also include the best practice consulting engagements and education conferences we performed in as a result of acquisitions  global services revenues increased by million  or  from to the increase in revenue of million  or  from to is primarily attributable to growing demand for qrs retail intelligence services and increased qrs professional services associated with higher enterprise software applications revenues 
this was offset by the significant decline in tradeweave digital photography revenues that were largely dependent on internet related companies 
our qrs retail intelligence services revenues exclude million of billings to kmart for services provided in the fourth quarter  which was not recognized due to kmart s announced bankruptcy in january we will recognize revenue in the future if any cash is received from kmart with the approval of the bankruptcy court 
we have continued to provide services to kmart since its chapter xi filing for which we are paid on a current basis subject to bankruptcy court supervision 
if kmart emerges from its chapter xi proceedings as a smaller company or is not able to successfully reorganize and ceases to exist  revenues for global services might be depressed 
cost of revenues for global services consist primarily of salary and related costs for field personnel to collect pricing data  software application consultants and technical support personnel for our licensed software applications  and digital photographers and editors  as well the costs of a state of the art photography studio in new york city opened in september in  cost of revenues increased by million  or  against a revenue increase of  resulting in negative gross margins 
cost of revenues for global services include a million impairment loss associated with the write down of property and equipment related to the tradeweave digital photography studio which was closed in september cost of revenues for global services in also include our personnel costs incurred to perform the services for kmart during the fourth quarter of prior to its chapter xi filing for which we did not recognize the related billings of million  as well as million of one time benefits charges related to this solutions group 
we have experienced higher benefit costs for our part time employees who collect retail pricing data 
in  cost of revenues for global services increased by million  an amount almost equal to the increase in revenues of million  reducing margins from in to in this significant cost increase was in large part due to the additional labor costs required to generate the additional revenues as well as facility costs for the photography studio that was opened in september global services gross margins declined further in fiscal year to 
we expect gross margins on our global services products to increase in future periods 
operating expenses the following table sets forth the operating expenses and the related percentages of total revenues of the company and a breakdown of full time headcount by sales and marketing  service and product development and general and administrative for the years ended december   and in thousands amount amount amount operating expenses sales and marketing    service and product development    general and administrative    operating expenses  before amortization of intangible assets and other non recurring operating expenses    amortization of intangible assets including goodwill  in process research and development  restructuring expenses  impairment loss  total operating expenses    headcount at year end sales and marketing service and product development general and administrative sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs in our sales and marketing organizations as well as the costs of various marketing programs 
at december   we had full time employees in our sales and marketing groups  compared to at the end of  and at the end of our expenses in this area remained essentially flat in total and as a percentage of revenues in when compared to during  we had stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock program and we increased the level of sales operations in europe and increased our domestic sales force to focus specifically on software applications 
this support for growth in the international market was offset entirely by cost savings realized from the integration of our subsidiary  tradeweave  inc  in february sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from to reflecting expansion of our sales and marketing organizations to support new product lines  particularly qrs sourcing that was acquired in march and qrs showroom that was introduced in april additionally  we increased sales and marketing resources for our other products and services 
we would expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues over time 
service and product development expenses service and product development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs related to research  development and enhancements of our licensed software and hosted software applications  qrs exchange s web forms solution  and other software for internal use at our qrs exchange managed ec outsourcing centers 
at december   we had full time employees in our service and product development groups  compared to at the end of and at the end of the expense amounts are net of capitalized service and product development costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for our licensed software applications that were introduced in the first quarter of  capitalized amounts are immaterial because products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time 
for our hosted software applications which include qrs catalogue and qrs showroom  we capitalize all the costs incurred during the application development stage  which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
of the million in total capitalized service and product development costs in  and  million related to our qrs showroom product 
we then wrote off million of this amount to cost of revenues for hosted software applications as a part of our impairment loss recorded in after adding back the capitalized amounts  actual spending was relatively flat over the three years at million in  million in  and million in it is our expectation that service and product development expenses will increase as a percentage of total revenues over time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and related costs of our finance and administrative organizations  as well as professional fees and other costs 
at december   we had full time employees in our general and administrative groups  compared to at the end of  and at the end of these expenses declined by  in total  or  from to and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 
this reduction was due primarily to the net reduction in headcount  offset by additional recruitment expense for senior management  stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock program  and accruals for contingent losses  as further described in note  the majority of which was charged to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in total  or  and as a percentage of revenues from to from to the significant ramp up in this area was due primarily to increased investments in infrastructure and increased headcount to support a larger organization principally due to the acquired businesses 
we also increased spending on professional fees associated with the development of corporate strategy 
it is our expectation that general and administrative expenses will decline as a percentage of total revenues over time 
amortization of intangible assets including goodwill amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets  including current technology  trade names  customer lists  workforce and non compete agreements 
amortization of intangible assets was million in  million in and million in of which  in  million in  and million in represented the amortization of goodwill and million in and million in represented the amortization of purchased current technology 
the increases in amortization of intangible assets were primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions as outlined in the following schedule in thousands acquisition acquisition date goodwill other intangible assets total intangible assets retail data services  inc and rds  inc 
rds july   image info inc image info january    rockport trade systems  inc rockport march   tradeweave  inc tradeweave  minority interest february  as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded impairment losses of during the year ended december  related to the write down of intangible assets including goodwill associated with these acquisitions see note to consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires businesses combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadened the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangible assets will be evaluated against these new criteria and may result in certain intangible assets being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill 
under the nonamortization approach  goodwill will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
the provisions of each statement apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june   as well as goodwill and intangible assets existing at that date 
sfas no 
will require us to review goodwill and intangible assets to determine which assets will no longer be amortized  and which assets may require a change in their estimated useful lives  and to assess potential asset impairment  measured on a fair value basis 
under sfas no 
 we are required to complete the initial step of the transitional impairment test within six months of adoption and to complete the final step of the transitional impairment test by the end of the fiscal year 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles for the second quarter of we will adopt the new standards  effective january  at december   the carrying amount of goodwill was approximately million and we believe our adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of rockport and image info  we expensed million million for image info and million for rockport  representing and of the purchase prices  respectively of in process research and development ipr d related to eight software applications research projects under development for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition dates 
the value of each project was determined through the income approach  which involved discounting cash flows to be derived from the future products to present value using discount rates ranging from to 
the discount rates were developed by computing the weighted average cost of capital of established companies similar in operations and then increased to reflect the additional risk for technology under development since these projects have not reached technological feasibility 
the revenue and expense projections were based on historical trends and future expectations for the acquired companies and qrs 
these projects have been completed and the actual costs were in line with estimates 
restructuring expenses on february   we announced a reorganization plan that included the full integration of the operations of qrs and tradeweave see note to consolidated financial statements and an alignment of our organization with a single go to market strategy focused on enhanced synergies within qrs with resulting cost reductions 
in connection with the implementation of the february reorganization  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   comprised of severance of million and accelerated stock based compensation expense of  for involuntary terminations throughout qrs  and a facilities closure expense of million 
during september  we discontinued our tradeweave digital photography service due to underperformance 
as a result  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   comprised of severance of  for involuntary terminations within the tradeweave digital photography group  and facilities closure expense of million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations  which included the realignment and certain eliminations of our products and services  the elimination of full time positions and the consolidation of real estate 
as a result  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   comprised of severance of million for involuntary terminations throughout qrs  and facilities closure expense of million 
as of december   the accrued liability related to our business restructuring was million  comprised of severance of million and sublease loss accruals of million 
we expect to pay the remaining severance liability in full by the first quarter of  and the remaining obligation related to our termination of non cancelable leases will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal our restructuring initiatives in are expected to result in operating expense reductions of approximately million to million in real estate and salary expense in restructuring expenses include stock based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting under the restricted stock program 
impairment loss during and  we formed an internet start up company  tradeweave  inc tradeweave and we completed three acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings for our existing customers  as well as to penetrate new markets within the retail industry beyond the general merchandise and apparel sector which represents the majority of our historical business 
in  we established tradeweave as a separate legal entity in order to attract top employees and to minimize the launch time for its products which included an on line marketplace for the disposition of surplus and mark down apparel 
mr 
peter johnson  our chairman of the board of directors  and mr 
garth saloner  a director and chairman of the compensation committee  purchased a minority interest in this company and were directors of this company 
by late  tradeweave s solution had evolved to address the full retail cycle 
in order to implement a single go to market strategy and to fully integrate the products and services of tradeweave and qrs  we decided to merge their business into ours 
in february  we acquired the minority interest in our subsidiary tradeweave  inc and completed a reorganization which resulted in cost savings as the result of headcount reductions and office facility consolidations see note to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this related party transaction we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
in july  we purchased rds  a national market research and data management firm dedicated to the collection  verification and analysis of competitive retail pricing  promotion and distribution information primarily to grocery retailers 
this acquisition added million universal product codes to the qrs catalogue and was intended to add additional data elements to the qrs catalogue such as nutrifacts and other price information 
this acquisition added most of the top us grocery chains as customers 
in january  we purchased image info to offer imaging software and services to our customers 
our retailer and vendor customers needed advanced imaging solutions to display images on their internet sites  as well as to use internally for a wide variety of inventory management and marketing purposes 
image info was intended to expand the functionality of qrs catalog through the addition of digital images as well as provide value added content and imaging to tradeweave showroom now qrs showroom 
the transaction was expected to enhance qrs current recurring revenue streams 
in march  we acquired rockport trade systems  inc rockport to offer an expanded portfolio of product selection  direct procurement  purchasing  costing  financial and logistics software applications targeted to meet the global trading needs of retailers  vendors  manufacturers and service providers 
the rockport products and services were intended to leverage existing products and services and allow us to offer complete electronic commerce services to our customers and prospects around the world and throughout the retail supply chain 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million associated with our tradeweave digital photography service which was acquired in connection with the acquisition of image info in january the impairment loss  determined based on analysis performed by american appraisal associates  inc  independent appraiser  and was comprised of the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of million  and the write off of the carrying amount of property and equipment of million  which was included in cost of revenues  primarily comprised of tenant improvements for the closure of our new york photography studio as well as photographic equipment 
tradeweave digital photography revenues were largely dependent on internet related companies and we had seen a significant decline in revenues during in addition  the impairment loss during the third quarter ended september  also included a charge of  related to the write off of the value of a web portal  which was under construction 
during the fourth quarter of  under the leadership of our new management  we initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our products and services and market opportunities 
in consideration of the current tightening in information technology spending and uncertainties in the marketplace along with analysis performed by american appraisal associates  inc  we concluded that future cash flows from the assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of rockport  image info  rds and tradeweave would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the acquired goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets 
therefore  we recorded an impairment loss of million for the year ended december   comprised of the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of million associated with the qrs sourcing product acquired in connection with our acquisition of rockport  million associated with the qrs merchandising product acquired in connection with our acquisition of image info  million associated with qrs retail intelligence services acquired in connection with our acquisition of rds  million associated with the qrs showroom product which was recorded in connection with our acquisition of the tradeweave minority interest  and write off of the carrying amount of tenant improvements and other assets of million  of which million is included in cost of revenues 
we recognized an additional impairment loss of million which has been included in cost of revenues related to the write off of capitalized service and product development costs related to the qrs showroom product as the result of an impairment analysis 
as a result of this impairment loss  the remaining carrying value of intangible assets including goodwill at december  was million  of which million is related to the rockport  image info  rds and tradeweave acquisitions 
we believe that our adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased from million in to million in and to million in changes in interest income reflect the level of average balances in each year and a decrease in marketable securities yields 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense was million for we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax benefit for as a percentage of pre tax loss reflects the non deductibility of purchase accounting amounts related to the acquisitions of rockport and image info 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for in  we established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carryforward  before they expire 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets  use of estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from three principal sources trading community management associated revenues relate to the transmission of standard business documents over a network 
such revenues are recognized in the month that such transmission services are performed 
software applications revenues from licensing of enterprise software applications is recognized upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection is probable and if there are no significant company obligations with regard to implementation of the software 
revenue from hosted software applications is recognized as services are performed 
with respect to the qrs catalogue  monthly fees are billed based on level of usage 
global services fees for qrs retail intelligence services and qrs professional services are billed as the related services are performed 
software maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the related contract which is typically one year 
we accumulate relevant information from contracts to use in determining the availability of vendor specific objective evidence and believe that such information complies with the criteria established in statement of position as follows customers are required to pay separately for annual maintenance 
future renewal rates are included as a term of the contracts 
we use the renewal rate as vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance 
we charge standard hourly rates for consulting services based upon the nature of the services and experience of the professionals performing the services and such services are separately priced in contracts 
training is separately priced in the contract 
customer billing occurs in accordance with contract terms 
customer advances and amounts billed to customers in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
amounts recognized as revenue in advance of billing are recorded as unbilled receivables 
goodwill and other intangibles assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  capitalized product and service development costs  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of and we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
use of estimates the calculation of the estimated sublease loss reserve for vacated facilities requires that management must make estimates of potential future sublease income 
management analyzes current market conditions for real estate with the assistance of reputable commercial real estate brokers 
however  future actual sublease income may materially differ from estimated amounts 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation and asserted claims is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
liquidity and capital resources the increase of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale from december  to december  resulted primarily from cash flows from operations of million offset by payments for acquisition related costs and capital expenditures 
on july   we used million in cash to acquire rds 
on january   we used million in cash to acquire image info and in january we used million for a deferred acquisition payment related to rds 
during may  we used million in cash to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
in april we used million for a deferred acquisition payment related to image info and in january we used million for a deferred acquisition payment related to rds 
while cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale increased by million during  working capital decreased by million as the result of an increase in current assets of million offset by a large increase in current liabilities of million from december  to december  the principal reasons for the increase in current liabilities were an increase in accrued compensation of million due primarily to the severance component of our restructuring expenses  increase in sublease loss accrual of million  also a result of the restructuring expenses  and a million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the timing of payments under our network services contract with ibm 
total assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to the impairment loss of million and the amortization of intangible assets including goodwill of million 
total liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december   which includes million in sublease loss accruals related to restructuring 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to million of our common stock in both open market and block transactions 
our board of directors authorized a million increase in this repurchase amount on october   and an additional increase of million on may   for a total of million 
shares purchased under this program will be held in the corporate treasury for future use including employee stock option grants and the employee stock purchase plan 
we may discontinue purchases of our common stock at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock during the year ended december  although cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will decline in the first half of  management believes that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available for sale at december  and cash anticipated to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  execute our operating plans or acquire complementary technologies or businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
however  we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we have no plans to pay dividends with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future 
during  a significant portion of our cash inflows was generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized

on february   we executed a sublease agreement for our san francisco facility under a non cancelable operating sublease

risks relating to our business an investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k before purchasing our common stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
the economic slowdown in the retail industry makes uncertain our future operating results 
historically  we have generated all of our revenues from the sale of products and services to the retail industry 
the retail industry is experiencing a marked slowdown as part of the general economic downturn of the last couple of years and the impact of the terrorist attacks on september  in addition  we believe that the retail industry may be consolidating and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition and weakening economic conditions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
furthermore  some of our largest customers  including kmart corp  have filed for bankruptcy 
such weakening economic conditions in the retail industry  consolidation and bankruptcy filings have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services to existing and potential customers in the retail industry 
the loss of any large retail or vendor customer may also result in our loss of all of the trading partners of that retailer or vendor that are also our customers  which would have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the license of our software products may involve a substantial capital expenditure by our retail customers 
as a result of the economic slowdown in the retail industry  we believe that our current and potential retailer customers have been  and will be less likely to  make such capital expenditures 
unless the retail industry recovers from its current economic slowdown  our business  operating results and financial condition may continue to suffer materially 
we have experienced significant losses in recent fiscal periods  and may continue to experience losses in the foreseeable future 
we have recently incurred significant losses  including net losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
a substantial amount of these losses were in connection with non cash charges relating to the impairment of remaining intangible assets  including technology and goodwill  acquired through our acquisitions in recent years of rockport trade systems inc  image info inc  and retail data services inc  as well as our acquisition of the outstanding minority interest of tradeweave inc we may continue to incur non cash charges related to the impairment of other intangible assets  as well as non cash charges related to stock compensation 
further impairment of intangible assets could occur since the revenue and income potential of some of our services and products are unproven  and some of the markets we are addressing are in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance that new services and products introduced by us will gain market acceptance  or that new technologies or business methods will not be developed that replace or reduce the importance of our current offerings  and thus there can be no assurance that we will not need to take additional impairment charges 
even after excluding impairment losses  restructuring expenses  as well as the write off of capitalized service and product development costs and the write down of property and equipment included in cost of revenues  our pro forma net loss for the year ended december   would have been million 
we may continue to incur significant operating losses in the future 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team 
in recent years we have experienced significant turnover in our management team 
our current president and chief executive officer joined us in october  and our current chief financial officer joined us in january other members of management have also joined us only recently  and the team as a whole has had a very limited time to work together 
our success depends upon the performance of our executive officers and other key employees and the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
there can be no assurance that the management team will be able to work together effectively  that we can continue to retain or recruit necessary additional personnel  or that such new personnel will be efficiently integrated or be adequate for our current or future operations 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and there are risks associated with new product development 
the increasing use of the internet as a communications medium has rapidly changed the competitive environment of our industry 
the supply chain management industry is now characterized by rapid technological innovation 
while we continue to develop solutions that take advantage of the internet s potential  the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future are expected to derive from our traditional edi services  which are not internet based 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future  however  the future success of our services and products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products and services that are compatible with the internet 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our services and products and the introduction of new services and products 
there can be no assurance that our competitors and potential competitors will not succeed in developing competing technologies that are more effective or more effectively marketed than the services and products marketed by us or that would render our services or products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  the markets for our software applications are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we may not possess sufficient resources to continue to make the necessary investments in technology 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software applications  or bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing customers to our competitors and fail to attract new customers  which may adversely effect our performance and results of operations 
our business is marked by increased price competition 
the changed technological landscape and the desire of companies to obtain market share has resulted in increased price competition  particularly in our traditional edi services market 
this competition has caused us from time to time to reduce prices on these services 
we expect that as the retail industry continues to adopt existing and new information technologies  that competition and pricing pressures will increase 
if we are forced to effect further price reductions in connection with such increased competition  such reductions would reduce net sales in future periods to the extent not offset by increased unit sales or other factors 
price reductions in response to competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for business to business electronic commerce services in the retail industry is intensely competitive 
numerous other companies participate in the supply chain management industry generally 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources with which to improve and aggressively market their products 
in addition  some larger potential customers have chosen to develop their own supply chain management systems internally rather than to utilize the service and product offerings of external providers 
all of these competitive factors may adversely affect our business 
we have experienced difficulty in effectively integrating and managing acquired companies and their products 
in  we acquired two companies whose products included software applications 
in early  we acquired the minority interest of our subsidiary  tradeweave  inc and integrated its operations into ours 
in september  we shut down the digital photography line of business  which had been acquired through our acquisition of image info inc in january we have limited experience in integrating and managing acquired companies and selling products such as software applications and related services that produce revenue on a one time license fee basis rather than a recurring service fee model 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in fully integrating the acquired companies and their products into our business and financial model 
moreover  our recently expanded service and product offerings include many services and products that do not fit in our traditional network based recurring revenue business model 
if we are unable to successfully integrate or manage our other acquired companies and their products  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
we may continue to enter into business combinations in order to expand our operations 
we may choose to continue to expand our operations or market presence through business combinations  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with third parties 
there are a number of risks associated with such transactions  such as the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of attention of management  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  additional expenses associated with the amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets  the potential assumption of additional debt  and or an issuance of equity  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls and policies  and the impairment of relationships with existing employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other potential problems encountered in connection with such business combinations or similar transactions  or that such transactions would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including changes in the demand for our services and the use of our existing services  changes in customer buying patterns  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our services and products  changes in operating expenses  changes in our strategy  introduction of alternative technologies by our competitors  effect of potential acquisitions and the integration and management of acquired products  and industry and general economic factors 
in addition  our limited operating history with software application licensing makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we have experienced  and may experience in one or more future quarters  operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such an event  the price of our common stock has been  and would likely be  materially and adversely affected 
because our products and services are complex and perform mission critical functions  we are vulnerable to product defect and product liability claims 
our software products are complex and perform critical functions for our customers  and consequently carry inherent risks 
for example  our software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the possibility for program errors and failures may increase due to factors including the use of new technologies  the integration of third party software  or the need for more rapid product development that is characteristic of the software market 
we undergo pre release product testing by our current and potential customers to minimize risks  and our customer license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
nevertheless  such provisions may not always be enforced or enforceable in the various legal jurisdictions in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that any errors or failures by our products and services will not subject us to substantial product liability claims 
we are dependent on the ibm value added network 
pursuant to a contract that expires on december   we have used the ibm van as the network platform over which we provide customers with most of our qrs exchange products and services 
we depend on the ibm van for a substantial part of our revenues 
upon the expiration of our contract with ibm  in the event that ibm decides to increase the prices that it charges us  or reduces the amount of discounts or allowances we currently receive  and we are not able to pass along such increased costs charges to our customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  pursuant to the ibm contract  we currently pay a flat fee to ibm for our use of their network services 
if our use of the network services declines  our gross margins will decrease  thereby also adversely affecting our business and operating results 
because we have no right to control the maintenance and operation of the ibm van  we are subject to decisions that adversely affect the operation of the van and thus on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if ibm becomes unable or unwilling to provide van services  we would either have to provide these services directly or arrange for another third party to provide such services 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  or that the costs of any such arrangements would not materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
disruption or unavailability of the ibm van may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
ibm and at t are free to compete against us  and we cannot assure you that either of them will not choose to compete with us in the future 
if at t markets ibm van services to the retail industry or directly to our customers  or permits one or more of our competitors to use and remarket ibm s van services to the retail industry  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
damage to our data center facility could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our data center is located in a single facility and we have no present intention of establishing an additional data center in a separate location 
notwithstanding the precautions we have taken to protect ourselves and our customers from delivery interruption events  we cannot assure you that a fire  earthquake  or other natural disaster affecting the data center would not disable our computer system 
any significant damage to our data center  or disruption of its connectivity to the ibm van and the at t network  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and information 
intellectual property laws afford only limited protection 
any patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection  and we may not be able to police unauthorized use of our services  proprietary technology  or information 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products and services may be distributed may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
if unauthorized third parties obtain and use our proprietary technology and information  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  claims by third parties regarding the infringement of alleged intellectual property rights are a frequent occurrence in our industry 
although we do not believe that we are infringing any proprietary rights of others  any such third party claims may similarly materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain anti takeover provisions could discourage attempts to acquire control of us 
we are a delaware corporation 
the delaware general corporation law  and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain certain provisions that may make a change in control of our company more difficult or prevent the removal of incumbent directors 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
in addition  our stockholders are not entitled to call a meeting  or to act by written consent 
furthermore  our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate voting rights  dividend rates and privileges of the preferred stock  all of which may be senior to the rights of the common stockholders 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock in august and could be subject to significant fluctuations in the future based on any number of factors  such as announcements of new services by us or by our competitors  fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or our competitors  changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or our failure to meet these estimates  conditions in the internet commerce  information service  and high technology industries generally  and conditions in the financial markets generally 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future
