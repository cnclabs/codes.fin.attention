item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this cyclicality has been clearly demonstrated during the past six years  with downward cycles in  and and up cycles in and the most recent downturn  which began during the fourth quarter of  is the most severe downturn the ate industry has ever experienced 
our consolidated quarterly net revenues have declined from a peak of million for the quarter ended september  to million for the quarter ended december   a decline of approximately 
the decrease we have experienced in net revenues during is comparable to the peak to trough differences being experienced by most of the companies in our industry 
the approximate peak to trough percentage decline in quarterly net revenues by product segment is in the tester interface segment  in the manipulator docking hardware segment and in the temperature management segment 
we believe the larger percentage declines in the net revenues of our tester interface segment are primarily due to the fact that these product sales are driven predominantly by semiconductor manufacturers additions to production capacity  which essentially ceased during we believe the smaller percentage decline in the net revenues of our temperature management segment are the result of demand for certain products of this segment used in the research and product development projects of semiconductor manufacturers  which have not declined significantly during our net new orders booked bookings for were million compared to million for  a decline of million or 
our consolidated quarterly bookings have declined from a peak of million for the quarter ended september  to million for the quarter ended september   a decline of approximately 
the peak to trough percentage decline in quarterly bookings by product segment is consistent with the declines in net revenues discussed above 
in addition to the decline in our bookings  many of our customers delayed shipments of previously ordered products until or cancelled their orders 
as a result  our backlog declined from million at december  to million at december  bookings for the quarter ended december  were million  a increase from the prior quarter and the first sequential quarterly increase in five quarters 
the current industry consensus is that a recovery will not occur until the second half of  an d we see nothing in our business to contradict this assessment 
we cannot be sure as to the length and depth of this current downturn or when the next cyclical growth phase will occur or the rate at which it will accelerate 
in response to the severe downturn  we implemented significant cost containment initiatives during to reduce operating losses and preserve cash 
these initiatives were completed in several stages as the magnitude of the downturn became more apparent throughout the most significant cost reduction was in personnel  where we reduced headcount by or people 
in addition  we implemented a temporary reduction in compensation for all worldwide employees as well as a temporary elimination of company contributions to retirement plans for all domestic employees 
significant reductions were also made in corporate travel  advertising  professional services and supplies 
the result of our cost containment efforts is reflected in the level of operating expenses  which declined from million for the quarter ended december  to million for the quarter ended december  the goal of these initiatives was to reduce fixed operating costs to a level which  based on current revenue pro jections  would allow us to maintain our present level of cash while still continuing our research and development programs and positioning ourselves such that  when the market improves  we are able to be a prime supplier for both new and existing technologies developed by our customers 
however  given the uncertainty of the continued severity of the industry downturn  we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken to date will be sufficient for us to accomplish this goal 
we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
historically  the majority of our manipulator  docking hardware and tester interface product sales have been made directly to semiconductor manufacturers  with sales to these end users typically in the range of to of our net revenues 
however  since the beginning of  many semiconductor manufacturers have begun to show a preference for purchasing from a single source the various components of the ate excluding temperature management systems that they need 
typically  this source is the tester manufacturer  who manufacturers the largest and most expensive components of the ate system 
as evidence of this trend  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  for manipulator docking hardware products and  and  respectively  for tester interface products 
these increases in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues in these two segments have been offset by a decrease in oem sales in our temperature management segment  which decreased for the years ended december  and from to  respectively 
we anticipate that oem sales as a percentage of net revenues may continue to increase in the future for our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface product segments 
the impact of this increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales have a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to c ontinue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line management groups to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from the semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading  or to improve the utilization  performance and efficiency of  existing ate tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in a handler 
we believe that this business is less cyclical than new ate sales 
however  during the current downward cycle we have seen our customers orders for these types of products decline as much  or in some cases  more than the other products we offer as compared with prior periods of reduced capital spending for ate 
we attribute this in part to reductions in our customers operating budgets combined with significant excess capacity that we believe exists throughout the industry 
we believe that much of this excess capacity is the result of capital equipment purchases made during the recent  prolonged expansion experienced by the industry  and therefore  this newer equipment does not need to be upgraded or improved 
please refer to the section entitled risks that could affect future results below for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of such business 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
while the manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments net revenues decreased million or and million or  respectively  during as compared to  the net revenues for the temperature management segment decreased by only million or in as compared to we believe that the decrease in net revenues for all of our product segments reflects the severe cyclical downturn in demand for ate in as compared to however  we attribute the smaller percentage decrease in the net revenues of our temperature management segment to continued demand for our thermostream r products which partially offset the effects of the current downturn on this product segment 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in we attribute the decrease in gross margin to several factors including the million write down of obsolete inventory during this inventory write down was made as a result of the continued downturn in our industry  which has caused items in our inventory to become obsolete 
excluding this write down  gross margin for was 
for our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments  the decline is primarily the result of a reduction in the absorption of fixed operating costs due to the significantly lower levels of revenue in compared to and an increase in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues is primarily the result of an increase in oem sales as a percentage of total sales  as previously discussed  as well as increases in the cost of aluminum which is a significant raw material component used in these prod ucts 
in addition  for our manipulator docking hardware segment  the decline in gross margin is also the result of increases in fixed operating costs due to facility expansions in the us  the us and singapore 
we believe this increased capacity adequately addressed the capacity constraints that impacted product shipments during most of for temperature management products  the decline in gross margin was the result of higher component material costs and increases in fixed operating costs 
the higher fixed operating costs are due to a facility expansion in early  and were partially offset by a decrease in salaries due to headcount reductions in the operations area 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to decreased commission expense due to the lower sales levels 
in addition  salaries  travel and advertising expenditures decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of the implementation of our cost containment program 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decease primarily to reduced salary expense resulting from the cost containment program 
in addition  our expenditures for research and development materials and travel decreased in our tester interface product segment 
these decreases were offset partially by an increase in spending on third party consultants involved in various product development programs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to an increase in salary expense resulting from the accrual of separation payments to be made based upon a prior contractual arrangement with a former executive of a subsidiary 
in addition  there were increases in both legal and audit expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in profit related bonuses  reductions in salaries for remaining employees  bad debt recoveries  reductions in directors fees and reduced spending on supplies 
impairment of goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  when events or circumstances so indicate  we assess the potential impairment of our intangible assets and other long lived assets based on anticipated undiscounted cash flows from operations 
such events and circumstances include a sale of all or a significant part of the operations associated with the long lived asset or a significant decline in the operating performance of the asset 
the amount of the impairment charge  if any  is calculated by comparing the anticipated discounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill as of september   due to the current industry downturn 
as a result of this assessment  a million impairment charge was recorded for the goodwill associated with the acquisition of testdesign  which was the net book value of this goodwill as of that date 
no impairment was indicated for the goodwill that is associated with the acquisition of three of our foreign subsidiaries  which had a net book value of  at december  merger related costs 
merger related costs totaling million were recorded during as a result of our merger with temptronic corporation 
there were no merger related costs during write off of deferred offering costs 
during september  we withdrew our registration statement for the offering of million shares of our common stock  million of which were to be offered by us and million by certain of our stockholders 
approximately  of costs related to the withdrawn offering  which consisted primarily of professional fees  printing costs and roadshow costs  were expensed during the third quarter of other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in other income is primarily the result of the  reduction in interest income  resulting from lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in third party royalty income from the licensing of our intellectual property 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax benefit was million for compared with income tax expense of million for our effective tax rate for was primarily as the result of the recording of a million charge for impairment of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate was  primarily due to million of non tax deductible merger related costs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe that the significant increase in net revenues over the comparable prior period was principally the result of growth in the demand for ate that continued through most of as compared to gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of increased material costs coupled with higher levels of fixed manufacturing costs and  to a lesser extent  for manipulator and docking hardware products as well as tester interface products  an increase in the percentage of oem sales in compared to the increase in material costs was mainly the result of a significant inventory write down due to obsolescence and  to a lesser extent  higher costs to purchase certain component materials  such as aluminum  as well as increases in fabrication costs 
the inventory write down was made against certain discontinued product lines  as well as other products where we did not see significant future demand relative to inventory levels 
we believe the increase in fabrication costs was the result of higher demand for fabrication in most of the markets where we operate 
the increase in fixed manufacturing costs was primarily the resul t of increased levels of salary expense due to additional operations staff hired in late and in response to increased business activity as well as salary increases for existing staff  combined with higher facility and depreciation costs primarily resulting from the relocation of certain of our manufacturing facilities in the us in order to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity 
the decline in gross margin was partially offset by the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs over significantly higher net revenue levels in compared to selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased commission expense related to the higher sales levels in  as well as higher levels of salary and benefits expense for new and existing staff 
to a lesser extent  higher levels of warranty expense  travel costs  freight and advertising expenditures also contributed to the increase in selling expense 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to the salary and benefits expense of additional engineering and technical staff and  to a lesser extent  increased spending on product development materials and fees for technical consultants associated with new product development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increases in incentive compensation for existing staff and  to a lesser extent  increases in professional fees and travel costs 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt of  in settlement of patent infringement litigation  which was recorded as a reduction of legal expense 
merger related costs 
merger related costs resulting from our merger with temptronic corporation were million  which consisted primarily of fees paid to investment bankers  professional fees  printing  escrow and other miscellaneous costs 
write off of deferred offering costs 
during september  we withdrew our registration statement for the offering of million shares of our common stock  million of which were to be offered by us and million by certain of our stockholders 
approximately  of costs related to the withdrawn offering  which consisted primarily of professional fees  printing costs and roadshow costs  were expensed during the third quarter of other income expense 
other income expense was  for compared to  for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase to the reduction in interest expense resulting from debt retirements early in  combined with an increase in interest income in from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents in compared to and an increase in other miscellaneous income 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for from million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for the significant increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to million of non tax deductible merger related costs incurred in  which significantly increased the effective tax rate  combined with a million reduction in the valuation allowance in  which significantly reduced the effective tax rate 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on management s assessment of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million 
accounts receivable decreased million from december  to december  due to the industry downturn throughout inventories decreased million  primarily as the result of the write down of obsolete inventory in net domestic and foreign income taxes increased by million  primarily as the result of the operating losses incurred during we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately million during the first half of accounts payable decreased million due to lower production levels during accrued expenses decreased million as a result of the payment of previously accrued expenses including sales commissions  incentive compensation and merger related costs 
purchases of machinery and equipment were million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of improvements to our facilities in the uk  singapore and massachusetts 
we also acquired an additional coordinate measuring machine for our cherry hill  new jersey facility under a capital lease 
during the first half of  we relocated our uk manufacturing operation to a new facility and converted the previous facility to a machine shop  we spent approximately  for tenant improvements  furniture and new machining equipment 
we relocated our singapore subsidiary during april and spent approximately  on leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture and equipment for this facility 
during may  we relocated our temptronic subsidiary and spent approximately million on leasehold improvements and purchases of furniture and equipment for this facility 
our lease on this facility entitles us to a reimbursement of approximately  which we expect to receive during during june  we spent approximately  on new equipment for our sunnyvale facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  including approximately  for equipment that was refinanced under a capital lease and approximately  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted to employees 
our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year in thousands contractual commitments beyond total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations letters of credit as of december   we have a million committed  unsecured line of credit  of which million was available to borrow the million committed amount less  in letters of credit we have issued to third parties under this line 
this line of credit is due to expire september  we are currently negotiating with the bank which issued this line of credit to modify this facility to extend the maturity for a period of two years 
we expect that the amended agreements will provide for the granting of a security interest in most of our domestic assets and the addition of certain negative covenants 
we believe that our existing cash balances and line of credit plus the anticipated net cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we have been experiencing operating losses due to the severe industry downturn 
should the current industry downturn continue for longer than anticipated  or be more severe than we currently project  and we are unable to further significantly reduce our fixed operating expenses  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot determine with certainty that  if needed  we would be able to raise additional funding through either equity or debt financing 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  any payment of dividends would require the prior consent of the lender 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
sfas no 
also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of adoption 
as of the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill of  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas nos 
and amortization expense related to goodwill was   and  for the years ended december   and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas nos 
and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes c riteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain of our accounts  including goodwill  inventory obsolescence write downs  deferred income tax valuation allowances and warranty reserves  are particularly impacted by estimates 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
for example  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill during due to the current industry downturn 
this impairment assessment was based upon ten year projections of operations for our subsidiaries where goodwill was associated 
in preparing these projections  we made subjective determinations of future events 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could have occurred 
as a result of this assessment  a million impairment charge was recorded for the goodwill associated with the acquisition of testdesign  which was the net book value of this goodwill as of that date 
in reviewing our inventory for obsolescence  we make assumptions about future demand for parts contained in our ending inventory  which affect the levels of inventory write downs during the period 
these assumptions include estimates of future demand for our products as well as when these products will become technologically obsolete 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could have occurred 
as a result of this analysis  there was a million write down of obsolete inventory during deferred tax assets must be analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
to perform this analysis we prepare projections of our operations in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if our projections do not indicate there will be sufficient levels of operating income in future periods to realize the deferred tax assets  we establish a deferred income tax valuation allowance to offset the deferred tax assets 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred income tax valuation allowance established 
finally  in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that will occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly exceed historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would not be sufficient to cover future warranty expenses and additional significant warranty expense would need to be accrued 
risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
these factors may also cause our future results to differ materially from our prior results 
our forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  may  will  should or anticipates or similar terminology  and include  but are not limited to  statements made in this report regarding the significant economic downturn in the ic and ate industries and the anticipated reversal of this cycle  developments and trends in the ic and ate industries  the possibility of future acquisitions  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions  our cost containment initiatives  the development of new products and technologies by us or our competitors  the availability of materials used to manufacture our products  the availability of qualified personnel  general economic conditions  net revenues generated by foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations and the use of forward exchange rate contracts  the increasing use of front end testing by semiconductor manufacturers  stock price fluctuations  the anticipated market for our products  and the sufficiency of cash balances  lines of credit and net cash from operations 
our operating results and financial condition could continue to be negatively impacted if the semiconductor industry into which we sell our products remains depressed 
the current economic downturn  combined with significant excess production capacity in the semiconductor industry  have resulted in the worst downturn the semiconductor and ate industries have ever experienced 
this climate has created significantly diminished demand for our products  excess manufacturing capacity in our plants  and the erosion of average selling prices 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last 
the terrorist attacks on september  may have exacerbated this downturn or caused it to last longer 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
in addition  we may be required to secure debt or equity financing  and we cannot be sure that such financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
capital expenditures by these companies depend upon  among other things  the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them 
typically  semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downtown 
conversely  semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products 
these market changes have caused in the past  and will likely cause in the future  our operating results to fluctuate 
the current cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry has significantly reduced demand for our products 
our sales and operating results will likely continue to be reduced during this downturn 
our operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
during the last three years  our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
in addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past  and that may cause fluctuations or losses in the future  include competitive pricing pressures  the impairment of our assets due to reduced future demand for our products  our ability to control operating costs  delays in shipments of our products  the mix of our products sold  the mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products  changes in the level of our fixed costs  costs associated with the development of our proprietary technology  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions and plant relocations and expansions  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support our new business  our ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed  and cancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers 
because the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on  and in relation to  changes in our operating results  fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue 
if we are not able to control our operating expenses during a cyclical downturn  we may not have sufficient cash to operate our businesses 
due to the current cyclical downturn  we have implemented cost containment strategies with a goal of reducing our operating expenses and preserving our cash 
these strategies include workforce reductions at all of our facilities worldwide  salary reductions for all employees worldwide  a temporary elimination of domestic retirement benefits and additional cost controls on other expenditures 
we may not be successful in reaching our goal of reducing our operating expenses sufficiently to maintain our existing cash balances and  if we are not able to control our operating expenses  they could increase and the level of our cash may not be sufficient to operate our businesses 
we cannot determine with certainty that  if needed  we would be able to raise additional funding through either equity or debt financing 
we intend to acquire additional businesses 
if we are unable to do so  our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited 
a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our current businesses 
we may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if we are unable to identify suitable businesses or technologies to acquire  we do not have access to required capital at the necessary time  or we are unwilling or unable to outbid larger  more resourceful companies 
our acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
if we acquire additional businesses  technologies or products  we will face the following additional risks future acquisitions could divert management s attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management  operational and financial resources  we might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably  we may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years  and our investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire 
if any of the events described above occur  our earnings could be reduced 
if we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions  we would dilute our existing stockholders interests and our earnings per share may decrease 
if we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions  lenders may impose covenants on use which could  among other things  restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses 
our industry is subject to rapidly evolving technological change  and our business prospects would be hurt if we are unable to respond to innovation in the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ics into an increasing variety of products 
this trend  and the rapid changes needed in automatic testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor industry  are likely to continue 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing  manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or attain market acceptance 
our failure to provide products that meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will hurt our business prospects 
if we are not able to obtain patents on or otherwise preserve and protect our proprietary technologies  our business may suffer 
we have obtained domestic and foreign patents covering some of our products which expire between the years and  and we have pending applications for additional patents 
some of our products utilize proprietary technology that is not covered by patent or similar protection  and in many cases  cannot be protected 
we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on our applications  any patents we own now or in the future will protect our business against competitors that develop similar technology or products  our patents will be held valid if they are challenged or subjected to reexamination or reissue  others will not claim rights to our patented or other proprietary technologies  or others will not develop technologies which are similar to  or can compete with  our unpatented proprietary technologies 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies  our ability to compete in our markets could be impaired 
claims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses 
from time to time  we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may be costly to us 
if we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms  our business could suffer 
in instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others  or that someone may be infringing our patent rights  we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question  as well as the potentially infringing conduct 
if we become involved in a dispute  neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel s conclusions 
our business will suffer if we cannot compete successfully with manufacturers whose products are similar to ours 
we compete with numerous manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of manipulator  docking and tester interface products are reid ashman manufacturing  microhandling gmbh  credence systems  ltx  schlumberger  teradyne and cerprobe 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of temperature management products are trio tech international  thermonics and ers elektronik gmbh 
in order to remain competitive with these and other companies  we must be able to continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel  financial resources  research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we are not able to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
we generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of our large customers  operating results could suffer dramatically 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net revenues in  and one customer  agilent technologies  accounted for of our net revenues in the loss of any one or more of our largest customers  or a reduction in orders by a major customer  could materially reduce our net revenues 
if we do not continue to retain the services of key personnel  relationships with  and sales to  some of our customers could suffer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively 
our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and certain other key employees 
generally  we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key employees 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to retain our managers  engineers and other key employees 
our business could suffer if we were unable to retain one or more of our senior officers or other key employees 
a substantial portion of our operations exists outside the us  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
we have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non us customers 
our foreign subsidiaries generated and of consolidated net revenues in and  respectively 
export sales from our us manufacturing facilities totaled million  or of consolidated net revenues in and million  or in the portion of our consolidated net revenues that were derived from sales by our subsidiaries in the asia pacific region were in and in countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have experienced economic instability resulting in weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
although the economic instability in the asia pacific region has not had a material adverse effect on our order backlog  financial condition  or results of operations to date  continued economic instability could have a material adverse effect on demand for ou r products and our results of operations 
we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues 
to date  we have not experienced significant problems in our foreign operations 
however  in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to customers outside the us and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks  which may  in the future  affect our operations 
these risks include political and economic instability in foreign countries  the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of us and foreign import and export laws  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the greater difficulty of administering business abroad 
we conduct business in foreign currencies  and fluctuations in the values of those currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
in  approximately of our net revenues were dominated in japanese yen  approximately were dominated in british pounds  and approximately were dominated in german deutsche marks 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
any strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the currencies of our competitors or customers  or strengthening or weakening of the japanese yen  british pound or german deutsche mark or the euro beginning in in relation to other currencies in which our customers or competitors do business  could adversely affect our competitiveness 
moreover  a strengthening of the us dollar or other competitive factors could put pressure on us to denominate a greater portion of our sales in foreign currencies  thereby increasing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
any devaluation of these currencies would hurt our business 
we do not undertake hedging activities against all of our exchange rate risk 
fluctuations in exchang e rates may adversely affect our competitive position or result in foreign exchange losses  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of our business  primarily in our japanese operations 
our exposure results from the fact that the sales of our japanese subsidiary are in japanese yen and inventory purchases are in us dollars 
we have the same exposure in our german operations as a portion of total sales are in german deutsche marks or the euro beginning in while inventory purchases are in us dollars 
we will also have a similar exposure in our singapore operations as our manufacturing operations expand  because our sales are in us dollars but some of our manufacturing costs are in british pounds and singapore dollars 
we employ risk management strategies  including the use of forward exchange rate contracts  to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the yen  and may  in the future  use forward exchange rate contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the singapore dollar and german deutsche mark or the euro beginning in 
our objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we use forward exchange rate contracts to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of our gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively affected by significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
we purchase forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts management deems appropriate in light of the amount of the us dollar denominated obligations of our japanese subsidiary that are due within the month 
we do not purchase forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is our policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not hedge all of our currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net earnings 
we do not expect that the results of our operations or our liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities
