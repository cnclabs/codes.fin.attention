item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
effective september   we entered into an amended credit facility with our bank lenders 
among other provisions  the amended agreement provides for a permanent waiver of past noncompliance and an extended maturity date of december  see liquidity and capital resources 
due to the deteriorating economic conditions and continued devaluation of the local currency  we reviewed our strategic alternatives with respect to the continuation of operations in latin america  including argentina and bolivia  and determined that we would benefit from focusing on our domestic operations 
effective september   we sold our latin american operations to local management for assumption of net liabilities 
revenues relating to our latin american operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges  operating expenses related to latin american operations totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
although we have not determined the final accounting  we do not expect there to be a negative financial impact from this transaction 
introduction we derive our revenue primarily from fees charged for ambulance and fire protection services 
we provide ambulance services in response to emergency medical calls emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services general transport services to patients on both a fee for service and nonrefundable subscription fee basis 
per transport revenue depends on various factors  including the mix of rates between existing markets and new markets and the mix of activity between emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services as well as other competitive factors 
fire protection services are provided either under contracts with municipalities  fire districts or other agencies or on a nonrefundable subscription fee basis to individual homeowners or commercial property owners 
medical transportation and related services revenue includes emergency and non emergency ambulance and alternative transportation service fees as well as municipal subsidies and subscription fees 
domestic ambulance and alternative transportation service fees are recognized as the services are provided and are recorded net of estimated medicare  medicaid and other contractual discounts 
ambulance subscription fees  which are generally received in advance  are deferred and recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the subscription agreement  which is generally one year 
payments received from third party payers represent a substantial portion of our ambulance service fee receipts 
we derived approximately of our net ambulance and alternative transportation fee collections during fiscal and from such third party payers 
we maintain an allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts based on credit risks applicable to certain types of payers  historical collection trends and other relevant information 
this allowance is examined on a quarterly basis and is revised for changes in circumstances surrounding the collectibility of receivables 
provisions for medicare  medicaid and contractual reimbursement limitations are included in the calculation of medical transportation services revenue 
because of the nature of our ambulance services  it is necessary to respond to a number of calls  primarily emergency ambulance service calls  which may not result in transports 
results of operations are discussed below on the basis of actual transports because transports are more directly related to revenue 
expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports are included in operating expenses 
the percentage of calls not resulting in transports varies substantially depending upon the mix of non emergency ambulance and emergency ambulance service calls in individual markets and is generally higher in service areas in which the calls are primarily emergency ambulance service calls 
rates in our markets take into account the anticipated number of calls that may not result in transports 
we do not separately account for expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports 
revenue generated under our former capitated service arrangements in argentina is included in medical transportation and related services revenue 
revenue generated under fire protection service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract 
subscription fees received in advance are deferred and recognized over the term of the subscription agreement  which is generally one year 
other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from dispatch  fleet  billing  training and home health care services and is recognized when the services are provided 
other operating expenses consist primarily of rent and related occupancy expenses  vehicle and equipment maintenance and repairs  insurance  fuel and supplies  travel and professional fees 
our net income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million or per diluted share for the year ended june  the net loss after the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million or per diluted share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million or per diluted share for the year ended june   and a net loss of million or per diluted share for the year ended june  our operating results for the year ended june  were adversely affected by asset impairment charges  our operational restructuring program involving the closure of certain service areas  the loss of two exclusive contracts  the disposition of clinic operations in latin america  changes in estimates that impacted our reserves for workers compensation and general liability matters  and additional provision for doubtful accounts related to closed or closing service areas and non transport related receivables 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for medicare  medicaid and other contractual discounts and doubtful accounts  general liability and workers compensation claim reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
medical transportation and related fee revenue recognition domestic ambulance and alternative transportation service fees are recognized when services are provided and are recorded net of a provision for medicare  medicaid  and other contractual reimbursement limitations 
because of the length of the collection cycle with respect to ambulance and alternative transportation service fees  it is necessary to estimate the amount of these reimbursement limitations at the time revenue is recognized 
estimates of amounts uncollectible due to the described reimbursement limitations are estimated based on historical collection data  historical write off activity and current relationships with payers  and are computed separately for each service area 
the estimated uncollectibility is translated into a percentage of total revenue which is applied to calculate the provision 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect the collectibility of the current revenue stream  revenue could be overstated or understated 
provisions made for reimbursement limitations on ambulance and alternative transportation service fees are included in the calculation of medical transportation and related service revenue and totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
provision for doubtful accounts for medical transportation and related fees ambulance and alternative transportation service fees are billed to various payer sources 
as discussed above  provisions for uncollectibility due to medicare  medicaid and contractual reimbursement limitations are recorded as provisions against revenue 
we estimate additional provisions related to the potential uncollectibility of other payers 
the estimates are based on historical collection data and historical write off activity and are computed separately for each service area 
the provision for doubtful accounts percentage that is applied to ambulance and alternative transportation service fee revenue is calculated as the difference between the total expected collection percentage less provision percentages applied for medicare  medicaid and contractual reimbursement limitations 
if historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect the collectibility of the current net revenue stream  the provision for doubtful accounts may be overstated or understated 
the provision for doubtful accounts on ambulance and alternative transportation service revenue totaled million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
workers compensation reserves beginning may   we purchased a corporate wide first dollar workers compensation insurance policy  under which we have no obligation to pay any deductible amounts on claims occurring during the policy period 
this policy covers all workers compensation claims made by employees of the company and all of its domestic subsidiaries 
accordingly  provisions for workers compensation expense for claims arising on and after may  are reflective of premium costs only 
prior to may   our workers compensation policies included a deductible obligation of  per claim  which was increased in recent years to  per claim  with no aggregate limit 
claims relating to these prior policy years remain outstanding 
claim provisions were estimated based on historical claims data and the ultimate projected value of those claims 
for claims occurring prior to may   our third party administrator establishes initial estimates at the time a claim is reported and periodically reviews the development of the claim to confirm that the estimates are adequate 
in fiscal year  we engaged an outside insurance expert to review the estimates set by our third party administrator on certain claims and to participate in our periodic internal claim reviews 
we also periodically engage actuaries to assist us in the determination of our workers compensation claims reserves 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the reserves for workers compensation claims could be overstated or understated 
reserves related to workers compensation claims totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
general liability reserves we are subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
in order to minimize the risk of our exposure  we maintain certain levels of coverage for comprehensive general liability  automobile liability  professional liability 
internally and throughout this report  we refer to these three types of policies collectively as general liability policies 
these policies currently are  and historically have been  underwritten on a deductible basis 
provisions are made to record the cost of premiums as well as that portion of the claims that is our responsibility 
in general  our deductible obligation for policies issued in fiscal years prior to ranges from  to  per claim with no aggregate limit  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
beginning in fiscal  our deductible amount increased to  per claim  however  we also purchased a liability ceiling for each of those policy years  which permanently caps our maximum deductible obligation 
our third party administrator establishes initial estimates at the time a claim is reported and periodically reviews the development of the claim to confirm that the estimates are adequate 
in fiscal year  we engaged an outside insurance expert to review the estimates set by our third party administrator on certain claims and to participate in our periodic internal reviews 
we also periodically engage actuaries to assist us in the determination of our general liability claim reserves 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the reserves for general liability claims could be overstated or understated 
reserves related to general liability claims totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated financial statements expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the years ended june    and years ended june  net revenue operating expenses payroll and employee benefits provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts change in accounting estimate depreciation amortization of intangibles other operating expenses asset impairment charges loss on disposition of clinic operations contract termination costs and related asset impairment restructuring charge and other operating income loss interest expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes  extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit net income loss before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle extraordinary loss cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  net revenue net revenue decreased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  medical transportation and related services medical transportation and related service revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the decrease in medical transportation and related service revenue is related to a million decrease in revenue in our latin american operations primarily resulting from decreases in memberships under capitated service arrangements and the devaluation of the argentine peso 
the decrease in memberships was attributable to the impact of economic conditions in argentina combined with significant increases in local service taxes on all medical services 
domestic medical transportation and related service revenue increased approximately million  or from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase is comprised of a million increase in same service area revenue attributable to rate increases  call screening and other factors 
additionally  there was a million increase in revenue related to a contract that began during the second quarter of fiscal offset by an million decrease related to the loss of contracts in arlington  texas and lincoln  nebraska and a million decrease related to the closure of service areas in fiscal and fiscal total domestic transports  including alternative transportation  decreased  or  from approximately  approximately  ambulance and approximately  alternative transportation for the year ended june  to approximately  approximately  ambulance and approximately  alternative transportation for the year ended june  the loss of contracts in arlington  texas and lincoln  nebraska accounted for a decrease of approximately  transports 
the closure of service areas in fiscal and accounted for a decrease of approximately  transports 
transports in areas that we served in both the year ended june  and decreased by approximately  transports 
these decreases were offset by an increase of approximately  transports related to a contract that began during the second quarter of fiscal fire protection services fire protection services revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  fire protection services revenue increased primarily due to rate and utilization increases in our subscription fire programs of million  increased contracting activity by our specialty fire protection group of  and a  increase in wildland fire services revenue 
we experienced a particularly active wildfire season in the latter part of the fiscal year ended june  increased activity in wildland fire services revenue has continued into the first quarter of fiscal other revenue other revenue decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  other revenue decreases are primarily due to a decrease in clinic revenue in our latin american operations of million as a result of the disposition in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating expenses payroll and employee benefits payroll and employee benefit expenses decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily attributable to the net impact of payroll and benefit increases resulting from contract renegotiations  service area expansions and wage rate increases million offset by reductions attributable to the argentine peso devaluation million  the impact of prior year service area closures million  and the absence in of prior year increases in health insurance reserves million and accrued paid time off million 
we expect that labor costs related to our ongoing operations will continue to increase 
payroll and employee benefits decreased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to of net revenue for the year ended june  see risk factors we have experienced material increases in the cost of our insurance and surety programs and in related collateralization requirements  claims against us could exceed our insurance coverage  and our reserves may prove inadequate 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million  or  from million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  the provision for the year ended june  included an additional million provision related to underperformance in collections in service areas closed during fiscal and  a million provision related to management s decision to reserve all outstanding non transport receivables in excess of days and a million provision related to contractual transport receivables that were deemed uncollectible 
the provision for doubtful accounts on domestic ambulance and alternative transportation service revenue excluding the additional provisions described in the preceding paragraph was for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  the decrease is reflective of the closure of underperforming operations and increases in collection rates in the remaining service areas 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on improving the quality of our revenue by reducing the amount of non emergency ambulance and alternative transportation transports in selected service areas as well as on previously implemented initiatives to maximize the collection of our accounts receivable 
a summary of activity in our allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts during the fiscal years ended june  and is as follows 
june  in thousands balance at beginning of year   provision for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts   provision for doubtful accounts   write offs and other adjustments   balance at end of year   depreciation depreciation decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   primarily due to asset write offs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the disposal of certain assets related to closed operations and a decrease in capital expenditures 
depreciation decreased from approximately of net revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  amortization we discontinued amortizing goodwill in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
 effective july  as a result  amortization of intangibles has decreased million to million for the year ended june  approximately  million of the amortization recorded in the year ended june  relates to an adjustment in the estimated lives of for certain other intangible assets acquired in previous business combinations 
amortization is expected to decline as these assets reach the end of their estimated lives 
see related discussion of the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
below 
other operating expenses other operating expenses consist primarily of rent and related occupancy expenses  vehicle and equipment maintenance and repairs  insurance  fuel and supplies  travel  and professional fees 
other operating expenses decreased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  approximately million of the decrease relates to charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including million of inventory adjustments as described below  million related to a medicare audit settlement  million related to the write off of amounts owed to us by a former owner  million related to asset write offs and reserve adjustments as a result of account reconciliations of our various argentine subsidiaries and million for several adjustments to certain estimates for prepaid expenses  accrued liabilities and other items  related to our domestic operations  that were resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  the year ended june  included a charge of million recorded for additional general liability reserves related to increases in reserves for reported claims as well as to establish reserves for claims incurred but not reported as described below 
decreases in other operating expenses in our latin american operations totaled million  primarily due to the devaluation of the argentine peso 
closure of service areas in fiscal and  as well as the loss of the contracts in arlington  texas and lincoln  nebraska  account for million of the decrease 
other operating expenses decreased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to of total revenue for the year ended june effective january   we refined our methodology for determining reserves related to general liability claims 
the changing environment with respect to the rising cost of claims as well as the cost of litigation prompted a comprehensive review by management of detailed information from external advisors  historical settlement information and analysis of open claims 
the new method more closely approximates the potential outcome of each open claim as well as legal costs related to the administration of these claims 
additionally  reserves were set up to cover potential unknown claims based on historical occurrences of claims filed subsequent to the end of the policy year 
for financial reporting purposes  this change was treated as a change in accounting estimate 
see risk factors we have experienced material increases in the cost of our insurance and surety programs and in related collateralization requirements  claims against us could exceed our insurance coverage  and our reserves may prove inadequate 
restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june   we decided to close or downsize nine service areas and in connection therewith  recorded restructuring and other charges totaling million 
for further discussion of these charges  see comparison of results for the fiscal year ended june  and june   below 
a summary of activity in the restructuring reserve  which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  is as follows lease write off other severance termination of intangible exit costs costs assets costs total balance at june      fiscal charge recorded      fiscal usage      adjustments   balance at june      fiscal usage    adjustments balance at june    other fiscal charges results of operations for the year ended june  include charges not applicable to the year ended june   including asset impairment charges  disposition of clinic operations and contract termination costs and related asset impairment 
see comparison of results for the fiscal year ended june  and june   below 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily caused by lower rates on the revolving credit facility as well as lower average debt balances 
additionally  approximately  of interest income received in conjunction with an income tax refund was netted against interest expense for the year ended june  interest expense is expected to increase in the next fiscal year due to new rates to be incurred under the amended credit facility 
see further discussion on the amended credit facility in liquidity and capital resources 
other income expense  net other income expense  net expense decreased million from the year ended june  to the year ended june  other expense in fiscal included a million charge relating to the purchase of the minority interest of a joint venture partner in one of our ambulance operations 
other income of  recorded in the year ended june  is related to the final settlement of amounts due under that joint venture agreement 
a description of the joint venture transaction is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million in compared with an income tax provision of million in the income tax benefit in resulted from federal income tax refunds of million resulting from recently enacted legislation that allowed us to carryback a portion of our net operating losses to prior years as well as refunds of million applicable to prior years for which recognition was deferred until receipt 
we did not recognize the future income tax benefits attributable to our net loss as it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective july  under the transitional provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each of our reporting units with the assistance of independent valuation experts  using a valuation date of july   and determined that a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  was required 
this impairment primarily relates to our medical transportation and related services segment 
the impairment charge is non cash and non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  retroactively applied to the quarter ended september   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the adoption of this accounting principle 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  net revenue net revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  medical transportation and related services medical transportation and related service revenue decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the decrease in medical transportation and related service revenue is related to a million decrease in revenue in our latin american operations related to decreases in memberships under capitated service arrangements due to the impact of the economic recession in argentina as well as a million decrease in revenue generated from our former canadian operations 
additionally  there were significant decreases in domestic medical transportation and related service revenue as described below 
domestic medical transportation and related service revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this decrease is comprised of a million decrease related to the closure of service areas in fiscal and and a million decrease related to the loss of a contract in lincoln  nebraska 
additionally  there was a decrease of million related to domestic medical transportation and related service revenue in areas we served in both the year ended june  and these decreases were offset by increases of million related to a contract that began in the second quarter of fiscal and an additional contract that began in the second quarter of fiscal total domestic transports  including alternative transportation  decreased  or  from approximately  approximately  ambulance and approximately  alternative transportation for the year ended june  to  approximately  ambulance and approximately  alternative transportation for the year ended june  the closure of service areas accounted for a decrease of approximately  transports 
the loss of the contract in lincoln  nebraska accounted for a decrease of approximately  transports 
transports in areas that we served in both the year ended june  and decreased by approximately  transports 
the new contracts described above accounted for approximately  additional transports 
fire protection services fire protection services revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  fire protection services revenue increased million due to rate and utilization increases for fire protection services  million due to rate increases under existing fire protection contracts  million due to new airport and industrial contracting activity and million due to forestry revenue increases 
other revenue other revenue decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  decreases in medical clinic revenue generated in argentina totaled million 
operating expenses payroll and employee benefits payroll and employee benefit expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  certain underperforming service areas that were closed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal accounted for million of the decrease  and million of the decrease is related to the closure of our canadian operations 
payroll and employee benefit expenses for the fiscal year ended june  includes million of additional workers compensation insurance expense related to increased claims experience  million required to bring the paid time off accrual for field personnel into line with the amount required under the related policies and million related to an increase in our employee health insurance reserves as calculated by our third party administrator 
the remaining decrease reflects reductions in payroll and employee benefit expenses in existing service areas due to decreased transports as discussed above 
payroll and employee benefit expenses increased from of total revenue during the year ended june  to of total revenue during the year ended june  increased service utilization in our argentine operations also contributed to the increase in payroll and employee benefit expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts  excluding the million change in accounting estimate in fiscal  increased million or from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we recorded a million provision related to underperformance in collections in service areas closed during fiscal in addition  we recorded a million provision related to estimated underperformance in collections for service areas included in the fiscal restructuring 
it has been our experience that once a service area has been exited  it becomes more difficult to collect outstanding receivables 
as a result  management determined that any non transport receivable in excess of days outstanding will be fully reserved 
this adjustment totaled million at june  an additional million provision was also recorded for contractual transport receivables that were deemed uncollectible 
during the year ended june   we experienced a decrease in collections in service areas that were closed or downsized due to our lack of physical presence in the service area 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of million and million recorded in the respective third and fourth quarters for uncollectible accounts in those service areas that were identified for closure or downsizing during those periods 
the provision for doubtful accounts on domestic ambulance and alternative transportation service revenue excluding the million recorded in fiscal and the million in fiscal  described above was for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  the increase in the provisioning rate for doubtful accounts is reflective of the new methodology being used to calculate the provision for doubtful accounts as described in the following paragraph regarding the change in estimate 
based on the increasingly unpredictable nature of healthcare accounts receivable and the increasing costs to collect those receivables  we concluded that the implemented billing process changes had not brought about the benefits anticipated 
as a result  we changed our method of estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts effective october  under our new method of estimation  we have chosen to fully reserve our accounts receivable earlier in the collection cycle than had previously been our practice 
we provide specific allowances based upon the age of the accounts receivable within each payer class and also provide for general allowances based upon historic collection rates within each payer class 
payer classes include medicare  medicaid  and private pay 
accordingly  the effect of this change was an additional million provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal  which is stated separately in the accompanying financial statements 
a summary of activity in our allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts during the fiscal years ended june  and is as follows june  in thousands balance at beginning of year   provision for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts   provision charged to expense   write offs and other adjustments   depreciation depreciation decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june   primarily due to the disposal of certain assets related to closed operations as well as a decrease in capital expenditures during the current year 
depreciation decreased from of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of net revenue for the year ended june  amortization amortization of intangibles decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this decrease was the result of the write off of million of goodwill in conjunction with the closure or downsizing of certain service areas during fiscal amortization was of net revenue for both the year ended june  and other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to additional general liability insurance reserves of million as explained more fully in the following paragraph  million related to asset write offs and reserve adjustments as a result of account reconciliations of our various argentine subsidiaries performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the million of inventory adjustments as discussed below  the accrual of million related to a medicare audit settlement and million related to the write off of amounts owed to us by a former owner 
these amounts are offset by a decrease of million relating to closed service areas  as well as decreases in other operating expenses in existing service areas related to decreased transports 
other operating expenses increased from of net revenue for the year ended june  to of total revenue for the year ended june  effective january   we refined our methodology of determining reserves related to general liability claims 
the changing environment with respect to the rising cost of claims as well as the cost of litigation prompted a comprehensive review by management of detailed information from external advisors  historical settlement information and analysis of open claims 
the new method more closely approximates the potential outcome of each open claim as well as the legal costs related to the administration of these claims 
additionally  reserves were set up to cover potential unknown claims based on historical occurrences of claims filed subsequent to the end of the policy year 
for financial reporting purposes  this change was treated as a change in accounting estimate 
we have experienced a substantial rise in the costs associated with both our insurance and surety bonding programs in comparison to prior years 
a significant factor is the overall hardening of the insurance  surety and re insurance markets  which has resulted in demands for larger premiums  collateralization of payment obligations and increasingly rigorous underwriting requirements 
our higher costs also result from our claims history and from vendors perception of our financial position due to our current debt structure and cash position 
sustained and substantial annual increases in premiums and requirements for collateral or pre funded deductible obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
we have been able to self fund these premium increases out of operating cash flow and have adjusted our budgetary assumptions to address anticipated future increases 
medical  fleet  and fire supplies are maintained in a central warehouse  numerous regional warehouses  and multiple stations  lockers  and vehicles 
a physical inventory of all locations at june  revealed a shortage from recorded levels 
shrinkage  obsolescence  and supplies lost due to closures account for most of the shortage 
to reduce the recorded inventory to the actual physical count  an adjustment of approximately million was recorded as a component of other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  asset impairment charges in connection with the budgeting process for the fiscal year ended june   which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we analyzed each cost center within our various service areas not identified for closure or downsizing to determine whether the associated long lived assets eg  property  equipment and goodwill would be recoverable from future operations 
cost centers represent individual operating units within a given service area for which separately identifiable cash flow information is available 
we performed this analysis as a result of our expectations of a challenging health care reimbursement environment as well as anticipated increases in labor and insurance costs with respect to our domestic ambulance operations 
this analysis considered the results of operations over the past year as well as cms s failure to implement the ambulance fee schedule as of january  the analysis with respect to our argentine operations included the impact of the deteriorating economic and political environment as well as information developed by a third party concerning the marketability of these operations during fiscal in order to assess recoverability  we estimated the related net future cash flows for each cost center and then compared the resulting undiscounted amounts to the carrying value of each cost center s long lived assets eg  property and equipment and goodwill 
it should be noted that property and equipment balances are specifically identified with each cost center 
additionally  goodwill is specifically identified with each cost center at the time of acquisition and  therefore  related allocations were not necessary for purposes of performing the impairment analysis 
for those cost centers where estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis were less than the related carrying amounts of the long lived assets  an asset impairment was considered to exist 
we measured the amount of the asset impairment for each such cost center by discounting the estimated future net cash flows using a discount rate of and comparing the resulting amount to the carrying value of its long lived assets 
based upon this analysis  the company determined that asset impairment charges approximating million were required for cost centers within our domestic and argentine ambulance operations 
the asset impairments were charged directly against the related asset balances 
a summary of the related charge is as follows property  equipment goodwill and other total in thousands domestic ambulance operations    argentine ambulance operations    total    restructuring charge and other during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june   we decided to close or downsize nine service areas and in connection therewith  recorded restructuring and other charges totaling million 
these charges included million to cover severance costs associated with the termination of approximately employees  lease termination and other exit costs of million  and asset impairment charges for goodwill and property and equipment of million and million  respectively  related to the impacted service areas 
the service areas selected for closure or downsizing generated revenue of million  operating losses of million and negative cash flow of million for the fiscal year ended june  during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended june   we decided to close or downsize service areas and in connection therewith  recorded restructuring and other charges totaling million 
these charges included million to cover severance costs associated with the termination of approximately employees  all of whom had been terminated by june   lease termination and other exit costs of million  and asset impairment charges for goodwill and property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
the service areas selected for closure generated revenue of million  operating losses of million and negative cash flow of million for the fiscal year ended june  a summary of activity in the restructuring reserve  which is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  is as follows lease write off other severance termination of intangible exit costs costs assets costs total balance at june    fiscal charge recorded      fiscal usage    balance at june      fiscal charge recorded      fiscal usage      adjustments   balance at june      disposition of clinic operations during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june   we sold our argentine clinic operations in exchange for a million non interest bearing note receivable

the clinic operations generated revenue of million  operating losses of million and negative cash flow of million for the fiscal year ended june  contract termination costs and related asset impairment in november  we learned that our exclusive contract in lincoln  nebraska would not be renewed effective december  and in connection therewith  recorded a contract termination charge of million 
this charge included asset impairments for related goodwill and equipment totaling million the exclusive contract was acquired in a purchase business combination in fiscal  million to cover severance costs associated with terminated employees  and million to cover lease terminations and other exit costs

interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was caused by higher than average debt balances during fiscal  fees  and additional interest incurred in conjunction with various waiver agreements 
other income expense  net other income expense  net expense increased by million from other income of million in fiscal to other expense of million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a charge of million relating to the put provisions contained in the joint venture agreement described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance and other permanent differences  consisting of goodwill write offs and amortization 
the permanent differences and the valuation allowance result in a reduction of the tax benefits which could otherwise be available in a loss year  and thus a reduction in the effective tax rate 
a valuation allowance of approximately million has been provided because we believe that the realizability of the deferred tax asset does not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
extraordinary loss during the year ended june   we recorded an extraordinary loss on the expropriation of canadian ambulance service licenses of approximately million net of of income taxes 
we received approximately million from the ontario ministry of health as compensation for the loss of license and incurred costs and wrote off assets  mainly goodwill  totaling million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the fiscal year ended june   resulted in a  approximate charge net of a tax benefit of approximately  and was related to our expensing of previously capitalized organization costs in accordance with statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the transitional impairment test of our goodwill and recorded a related million charge per share as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in restated first quarter results 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to an income tax refund received during the quarter 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of discretionary employee benefits previously accrued for the calendar year ended december  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we accrued million of additional workers compensation claim reserves in conjunction with a review of existing reserve levels 
additionally  we reversed an accrual for million related to an audit settlement with a medicare intermediary and million of our paid time off accrual as a result of changes to the related policies 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to the uncollectibility of receivables in service areas closed in fiscal we also recorded a million charge related to the loss of an exclusive contract in lincoln  nebraska 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to increased claims experience in workers compensation

we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in quarterly operating results 
this seasonality has resulted from a number of factors  including relatively higher second and third fiscal quarter demand for transport services in our arizona and florida regions resulting from the greater winter populations in those regions 
public health conditions affect our operations differently in different regions 
for example  greater utilization of services by customers under capitated service arrangements decrease our operating income 
the same conditions domestically  where we operate under fee for service arrangements  result in a greater number of transports  increasing our operating income 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million compared with net losses of million in fiscal and million in the net loss in fiscal included a charge of million relating to the adoption effective july  of sfas the net losses in fiscal and fiscal included asset impairment  restructuring and other similar charges totaling million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal and million in and cash used in operating activities totaled million in fiscal at june   we had cash of million  total debt of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
our total debt at june  included million of our senior notes due  million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  million payable to a former joint venture partner and million of capital lease obligations 
as discussed below  we were not in compliance with certain of the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility 
on september   we entered into an amended credit facility with our lenders which  among other things  extended the maturity date of the facility from march  through december   waived previous non compliance  and required the issuance to the lenders of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various restrictions and covenants contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
although there can be no assurances  management believes that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash balances will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through june  to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
historically  we have financed our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operating activities  term and revolving indebtedness  capital equipment lease financing  issuance of senior notes  the sale of common stock through an initial public offering in july and subsequent public stock offerings in may and april  and the exercise of stock options 
during the year ended june   cash flow provided by operations was approximately million resulting primarily from a net loss of million  offset by the effect of a non cash cumulative effect in a change in accounting principle of million  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million and provision for doubtful accounts of million 
additionally  cash flow from operating activities was negatively impacted by a decrease in accrued liabilities of approximately million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash flow provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended june  cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   primarily due to repayments on the revolving credit facility and on other debt and capital lease obligations 
cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  due primarily to capital expenditures of approximately million offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of approximately million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   due to capital expenditures of approximately million net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
our accounts receivable  net of the allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts  were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the decrease in net accounts receivable is due to many factors  including the collection of outstanding receivables related to closed service areas and overall improvement in collections on existing operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  the primary reason for this decrease is the write off of uncollectible receivables offset by the current period provision for doubtful accounts 
we have instituted several initiatives to improve our collection procedures 
while management believes that we have a predictable method of determining the realizable value of our accounts receivable  based on continuing difficulties in the healthcare reimbursement environment  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional future write offs 
see risk factors we depend on reimbursements by third party payers and individuals 
with respect to our general liability insurance policy for the policy year commencing in june  we are required to set aside  per month into a designated loss fund account  which cash is restricted to the payment of our deductible obligations as required under such policy 
a similar funding program is in place with respect to our general liability policy for the policy year commencing in june we expect to fund these deposits on a monthly basis in subsequent years until such time as our total loss fund deposits equal the contractual ceiling on our total deductible obligation under these policies 
the loss fund deposits are used as necessary to pay our deductible portion of claims related to the applicable policy year 
accordingly  the loss fund balances vary during the course of the year depending upon the frequency and severity of claims payments  however  we typically maintain a minimum balance in each loss fund of at least  an unanticipated increase in the frequency and severity of claims payments at any one time could exceed the applicable loss fund balance for that policy year  in which case  such claims payments could  either individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
see risk factors we have experienced material increases in the cost of our insurance and surety programs and in related collateralization requirements 
during fiscal years through  we purchased certain portions of our workers compensation coverage from reliance insurance company reliance 
at the time we purchased the coverage  reliance was an a rated insurance company 
in connection with this coverage  we provided reliance with various amounts and forms of collateral eg  letters of credit  surety bonds and cash deposits to secure our performance under the respective policies as was customary and required in the workers compensation marketplace at the time 
as of june   reliance held million of cash collateral under this coverage 
on may   reliance was placed under rehabilitation by the pennsylvania insurance department the department and on october  was placed into liquidation by the department 
as mentioned previously  the cash on deposit with reliance serves to secure our performance under the related policies  specifically  the payment by us of claims within our level of retention in the various policy years 
consistent with past practice  we periodically fund an imprest account maintained by our third party administrator who actually makes claim payments on our behalf 
it is our understanding that the cash collateral held by the reliance liquidator will be returned to us once all related claims have been satisfied so long as we have satisfied our claim payment obligations under the related policies 
to the extent that certain of our workers compensation claims have exceeded our level of retention under the reliance policies  the applicable state guaranty funds have provided such coverage at no additional cost to us 
for fiscal  we purchased certain portions of our workers compensation coverage from legion insurance company legion 
at the time we purchased the coverage  legion was an a rated insurance carrier 
in connection with the legion policy  we deposited million into a cell captive insurance program managed by mutual risk management mrm  an affiliate of legion 
this deposit approximated the amount of claims within our level of retention for the policy year may  through april  in contrast to the deposits placed with reliance  this deposit is not collateral to secure our performance under the policy but rather represents funds to be used by mrm to pay claims within our level of retention on our behalf 
as of june   mrm held million of cash under this program 
on april   legion was placed under rehabilitation by the department 
mrm has continued to utilize the cash on deposit to make claim payments on our behalf 
additionally  it is our understanding that these funds represent our assets and are not general assets of legion or mrm 
based on the information currently available  we believe that the amounts on deposit with reliance and legion mrm are fully recoverable and will either be returned to us or used to pay claims on our behalf 
our inability to access the funds on deposit with either reliance or legion mrm could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we had working capital of million at june   including cash of million 
including the classification of the entire outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and senior notes as a current liability at june   we had a working capital deficiency of million  including cash of million 
in march  we entered into a million revolving credit facility originally scheduled to mature march  the credit facility is unsecured and was unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our domestic wholly owned current and future subsidiaries 
interest rates and availability under the revolving credit facility depended on our meeting certain financial covenants  including total debt leverage ratios  total debt to capitalization ratios  and fixed charge ratios 
the revolving credit facility initially was priced at the greater of i prime rate or federal funds rate plus plus the applicable margin  or ii a libor based rate 
the libor based rates ranged from libor plus to libor plus 
in december  primarily as a result of additional provisions for doubtful accounts  we entered into noncompliance with three financial covenants under the revolving credit facility total debt leverage ratio  total debt to total capitalization ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
we received a series of compliance waivers regarding the financial covenants covering the periods from december  through april  the waivers provided among other things  for enhanced reporting and other requirements and that no additional borrowings would be available to us 
pursuant to the waivers  as libor contracts expired in march  all borrowings were priced at prime rate plus percentage points and interest became payable monthly 
pursuant to the waivers  we also were required to accrue additional interest expense at a rate of per annum on the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
we have recorded approximately million related to this additional interest expense through june   approximately million of which remains in accrued liabilities at june  in connection with the waivers  we also made principal payments in an aggregate amount of million 
at june   the weighted average interest rate  including the additional interest described above  was approximately on the revolving credit facility 
a principal balance of approximately million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility at june  also outstanding at june  were million in letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 
although we were not aware of any event of default under either the terms of the revolving credit facility as a result of the waivers or our senior notes  and although there was no acceleration of the repayment of the revolving credit facility or the senior notes  the balances were classified as current liabilities at june  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor 
effective september   we entered into an amended credit facility pursuant to which  among other things  the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to december  and our prior noncompliance including such noncompliance as of june  was permanently waived 
the principal terms of the amended and restated credit agreement are as follows waiver 
prior noncompliance was permanently waived with respect to the covenant violations described above and with respect to certain other noncompliance items  including non reimbursement of approximately million recently drawn by beneficiaries under letters of credit issued under the original facility 
maturity date 
the maturity date of the facility was extended to december  principal balance 
accrued interest as described above  non reimbursed letters of credit and various fees and expenses associated with the amended credit facility were added to the principal amount of the loan  resulting in an outstanding principal balance as of the effective date of the amendment equal to million 
no required amortization 
no principal payments are required until the maturity date of the facility 
interest rate 
the interest rate was increased to libor plus as of the effective date of the amendment  payable monthly 
by comparison  the effective interest rate including the accrued interest described above applicable to the original facility immediately prior to the effective date of the amendment was 
financial covenants 
the amended facility includes the same financial covenants as were included in the original credit facility  with compliance levels under such covenants adjusted to levels consistent with current business levels and outlook 
the covenants include i total debt leverage ratio initially set at  ii minimum tangible net worth initially set at a million deficit  iii fixed charge coverage ratio initially set at  iv limitation on capital expenditures of million per fiscal year  and v limitation on operating leases during any period of four fiscal quarters to of consolidated net revenues 
the compliance levels for covenants i through iii above are set at varying levels on a quarterly basis 
compliance is tested quarterly based on annualized or year to date results as applicable 
other covenants 
the amended credit facility includes various non financial covenants equivalent in scope to those included in the original facility 
the covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  and other matters 
the amended credit facility includes extensive financial reporting obligations and provides that an event of default occurs should we lose customer contracts in any fiscal quarter with ebitda contribution of million or more net of anticipated contribution from new contracts 
existing letters of credit 
pursuant to the amended facility  letters of credit issued pursuant to the original credit agreement will be reissued or extended  to a maximum of million  for letter of credit fees aggregating per annum 
a third letter of credit  in the amount of million which previously was drawn by its beneficiary  will be reissued subject to application of the funds originally drawn in reduction of the principal balance of the facility and payment of a letter of credit fee equal to per annum 
equity interest 
in consideration of the amended facility  we issued shares of our series b convertible preferred stock to the participants in the amended credit facility 
the preferred stock is convertible into  common shares of the post conversion common shares outstanding on a diluted basis  as defined 
because sufficient common shares are not currently available to permit conversion  we intend to seek stockholder approval to amend our certificate of incorporation to authorize additional common shares 
conversion of the preferred shares occurs automatically upon approval by our stockholders of sufficient common shares to permit conversion 
should our stockholders fail to approve such a proposal by december   we will be required to redeem the preferred stock for a price equal to the greater of million or the value of the common shares into which the preferred shares would otherwise have been convertible 
in addition  should our stockholders fail to approve such a proposal  the preferred stock enjoys a preference upon a sale of our company  a sale of our assets and in certain other circumstances  this preference equals the greater of i the value of the common shares into which the preferred stock would otherwise have been convertible or ii million  million or million depending on whether the triggering event occurs prior to january   december  or december   respectively 
at the election of the holder  the preferred shares carry voting rights as if such shares were converted into common shares 
the preferred shares do not bear a dividend 
the preferred shares and common shares issuable upon conversion of the preferred shares are entitled to certain registration rights 
the terms of the preferred shares limit us from issuing senior or pari passu preferred shares and from paying dividends on  or redeeming  shares of junior stock 
primarily because no principal amortization is required and because of the long term nature of this amendment  the outstanding balance on the credit facility is classified as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  additionally  as we are now in compliance with the terms of the credit facility  we have also classified the senior note balance to long term debt 
due to the higher interest rate associated with the amended credit facility  we anticipate that our cash interest expense will increase approximately million 
additionally  the fair value of the preferred stock  and other deferred financing costs associated with the amended facility  will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the agreement 
in march  we issued million of senior notes due the notes under rule a under the securities act of  as amended securities act 
interest under the notes is payable semi annually on september and march  and the notes are not callable until march subject to the terms of the indenture 
we incurred expenses related to the offering of approximately million and will amortize these costs over the life of the notes 
we recorded a  discount on the notes and will amortize this discount over the life of the notes 
unamortized discount at june  was approximately  and this amount is recorded as an offset to the long term debt  net of current portion in the consolidated financial statements 
in april  we filed a registration statement under the securities act relating to an exchange offer for the notes 
the registration became effective on may  the notes are general unsecured obligations of our company and are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our domestic wholly owned current and future subsidiaries 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the notes contain certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or consolidations 
since march  we have satisfied all of our cash needs through cash flow from operations and our cash reserves 
similarly  we expect that cash flow from operations and our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our regularly scheduled debt service and our planned operating and capital needs for the months subsequent to june  through our restructuring program we have closed or downsized several locations that were negatively impacting our cash flow 
in addition  we have significantly reduced our corporate overhead 
we have improved the quality of our revenue and have experienced an upward trend in daily cash collections 
there can be no assurance that we will meet our targeted levels of operating cash flow or that we will not incur significant unanticipated liabilities 
similarly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms satisfactory to us  or at all  should cash flow from operations and our existing cash resources prove to be inadequate 
as discussed above  though we have recently successfully negotiated an amendment and extension of our credit facility  we will not have access to additional borrowings under such facility 
if we are required to seek additional financing  any such arrangement may involve material and substantial dilution to existing stockholders resulting from  among other things  issuance of equity securities or the conversion of all or a portion of our existing debt to equity 
in such event  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be materially reduced  and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our current common stockholders 
if we require additional financing but are unable to obtain it  our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations since  the argentine peso had been pegged to the us dollar at an exchange rate of to in december  the argentine government imposed exchange restrictions which severely limited cash conversions and withdrawals 
when exchange houses reopened on january   the peso to dollar exchange rate closed at pesos to the dollar 
our argentine subsidiaries utilized the peso as their functional currency as their business was primarily transacted in pesos 
in order to prepare the accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended june   we translated the balance sheets of our argentine subsidiaries using the to exchange rate  the closing rate on june   while our statements of operations and cash flows were translated using the weighted average rate in effect during the period 
as the liabilities of the argentine subsidiaries exceed their assets  the change in exchange rates resulted in a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet as of june  further fluctuations in the peso to dollar exchange rate will impact the translation of the financial statements of the argentine subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes 
as a result of the sale of our latin american operations in september  it is not anticipated that future fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will have an adverse effect on us 
contractual obligations and other commitments we have certain cash contractual obligations related to our debt instruments that come due at various times over the periods presented below 
in addition we have other commitments in the form of standby letters of credit and surety bonds 
the following table illustrates the expiration of our contractual cash obligations as well as other commitments as of june  the amounts related to the credit facility in the following table have been adjusted to include the impact of accrued interest and costs million resulting from the september  amendment to the related agreement described in note to the consolidated financial statements

the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business 
we have significant indebtedness 
we have significant indebtedness 
as of june   we have approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  consisting primarily of million of senior notes due in and approximately million outstanding under a revolving credit facility which was subsequently amended 
the outstanding principal balance under the amended facility totals million 
our ability to service our debt depends on our future operating performance  which is affected by governmental regulations  the state of the economy  financial factors  and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient funds to enable us to make our periodic debt payments 
failure to make our periodic debt payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our loan agreements require us to comply with numerous covenants and restrictions 
the agreement governing the terms of the senior notes contains certain covenants limiting our ability to incur certain additional debt create certain liens pay dividends issue guarantees redeem capital stock enter into transactions make certain investments with affiliates issue capital stock of sell assets subsidiaries complete certain mergers and consolidations the amended credit facility contains other more restrictive covenants and requires us to satisfy certain financial tests  including a total debt leverage ratio  a total debt to total capitalization ratio  and a fixed charge ratio 
our ability to satisfy those covenants can be affected by events both within and beyond our control  and we may be unable to meet these covenants 
a breach of any of the covenants or other terms of our debt could result in an event of default under the amended credit facility or the senior notes or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow 
despite significant net losses in fiscal and  our restructuring efforts have enabled us to self fund our operations since march from existing cash reserves and operating cash flow 
however  we may be unable to sustain our targeted levels of operating cash flow 
our ability to generate operating cash flow will depend upon various factors  including industry conditions  economic conditions  competitive conditions  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
because of our significant indebtedness  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt service and is not available for other purposes 
the terms of our amended credit facility do not permit additional borrowings thereunder 
in addition  the amended credit facility and the senior notes also restrict our ability to provide collateral to any prospective lender 
if we are unable to meet our targeted levels of operating cash flow  or in the event of an unanticipated cash requirement such as an adverse litigation outcome  reimbursement delays  or other matters we will need to pursue additional debt or equity financing 
any such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we issue equity securities in connection with any such arrangement  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be materially reduced  and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our current common stockholders 
failure to maintain adequate operating cash flow will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on reimbursements by third party payers and individuals 
we receive a substantial portion of our payments for ambulance services from third party payers  including medicare  medicaid  and private insurers 
we received approximately of our ambulance fee collections from such third party payers during fiscal  including approximately from medicare 
in fiscal  we also received approximately of ambulance fee collections from these third parties  including approximately from medicare 
the reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays 
from time to time  we experience these delays 
third party payers are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for health care  including proposals to revise reimbursement policies 
we recognize revenue when we provide ambulance services  however  there can be lengthy delays before we receive payment 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  requests for reimbursement based on assertions that certain amounts are not reimbursable or additional supporting documentation is necessary 
retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third party payers 
we are subject to governmental audits of our medicare and medicaid reimbursement claims and may be required to repay these agencies if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed 
delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process adversely affect the level of accounts receivable  increase the overall costs of collection  and may adversely affect our working capital and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs 
we also face the continuing risk of non reimbursement to the extent that uninsured individuals require emergency ambulance service in service areas where an adequate subsidy is not provided 
amounts not covered by third party payers are the obligations of individual patients 
we may not receive whole or partial reimbursement from these uninsured individuals 
we continually review the mix of activity between emergency and general medical transport in view of the reimbursement environment and evaluate methods of recovering these amounts through the collection process 
we establish an allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts based on credit risk applicable to certain types of payers  historical trends  and other relevant information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and may increase or decrease such allowances from time to time  including in those instances when we determine that the level of effort and cost of collection of certain accounts receivable is unacceptable 
the risks associated with third party payers and uninsured individuals and the inability to monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
our collection policies or our allowance for medicare  medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts receivable may not be adequate 
we have experienced material increases in the cost of our insurance and surety programs and in related collateralization requirements 
we have experienced a substantial rise in the costs associated with both our insurance and surety bonding programs in comparison to prior years 
we have experienced significant increases both in the premiums we have had to pay  and in the collateral or other advance funding required 
we also have increased our deductible and self insurance retentions under several coverages 
many counties  municipalities  and fire districts also require us to provide a surety bond or other assurance of financial and performance responsibility  and the cost and collateral requirements associated with obtaining such bonds have increased 
a significant factor is the overall hardening of the insurance  surety and re insurance markets  which has resulted in demands for larger premiums  collateralization of payment obligations and increasingly rigorous underwriting requirements 
our higher costs also result from our claims history and from vendors past perception of our financial position due to our current debt structure and cash position  as well as the qualified opinion formerly issued with respect to our audited financial statements 
sustained and substantial annual increases in premiums and requirements for collateral or pre funded deductible obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
claims against us could exceed our insurance coverage 
we are subject to a significant number of accident  injury and malpractice claims as a result of the nature of our business and the day to day operation of our vehicle fleet 
the coverage limits of our policies may not be adequate 
liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or outcome  also may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 
our reserves may prove inadequate 
under our general liability and employee medical insurance programs  and under our workers compensation programs prior to may   we are responsible for deductibles in varying amounts 
our insurance coverages in prior years generally did not include an aggregate limitation on our liability 
we have established reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses under these policies 
our reserves are estimates based on industry data and historical experience  and include judgments of the effects that future economic and social forces are likely to have on our experience with the type of risk involved  circumstances surrounding individual claims and trends that may affect the probable number and nature of claims arising from losses not yet reported 
consequently  loss reserves are inherently uncertain and are subject to a number of highly variable and difficult to predict circumstances 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our reserves 
if our reserves prove to be inadequate  we will be required to increase our reserves with a corresponding reduction  which may be material  to our operating results in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we have engaged actuaries in recent years in order to verify the reasonableness of our reserve estimates 
recently enacted rules may adversely affect our reimbursement rates of coverage 
on april   the medicare ambulance fee schedule final rule became effective 
the final rule categorizes seven levels of ground ambulance services  ranging from basic life support to specialty care transport  and two categories of air ambulance services 
the base rate conversion factor for services to medicare patients was set at  plus separate mileage payment based on specified relative value units for each level of ambulance service 
adjustments also were included to recognize differences in relative practice costs among geographic areas  and higher transportation costs that may be incurred by ambulance providers in rural areas with low population density 
the final rule requires ambulance providers to accept the assigned reimbursement rate as full payment  after patients have submitted their deductible and percent of medicare s fee for service 
in addition  the final rule calls for a five year phase in period to allow time for providers to adjust to the new payment rates 
the fee schedule will be phased in at percent increments each year  with payments being made at percent of the fee schedule in and thereafter 
we believe the medicare ambulance fee schedule will cause a neutral net impact on our medical transportation revenue at incremental and full phase in periods  primarily due to the geographic diversity of our us operations 
these rules could  however  result in contract renegotiations or other actions by us to offset any negative impact at the regional level that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
changes in reimbursement policies  or other governmental action  together with the financial challenges of some private  third party payers and budget pressures on other payer sources could influence the timing and  potentially  the receipt of payments and reimbursements 
a reduction in coverage or reimbursement rates by third party payers  or an increase in our cost structure relative to the rate increase in the consumer price index cpi  or costs incurred to implement the mandates of the fee schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
certain state and local governments regulate rate structures and limit rates of return 
state or local government regulations or administrative policies regulate rate structures in most states in which we conduct ambulance operations 
in certain service areas in which we are the exclusive provider of services  the municipality or fire district sets the rates for emergency ambulance services pursuant to a master contract and establishes the rates for general ambulance services that we are permitted to charge 
rates in most service areas are set at the same amounts for emergency and general ambulance services 
for example  the state of arizona establishes a rate of return on sales we are permitted to earn in determining the ambulance service rates we may charge in that state 
ambulance services revenue generated in arizona accounted for approximately of total revenue for fiscal and approximately of total revenue for fiscal we may be unable to receive ambulance service rate increases on a timely basis where rates are regulated or to establish or maintain satisfactory rate structures where rates are not regulated 
municipalities and fire districts negotiate the payments to be made to us for fire protection services pursuant to master contracts 
these master contracts are based on a budget and on level of effort or performance criteria desired by the municipalities and fire districts 
we could be unsuccessful in negotiating or maintaining profitable contracts with municipalities and fire districts 
numerous governmental entities regulate our business 
numerous federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations govern various aspects of the business of ambulance service and fire fighting service providers  covering matters such as licensing  rates  employee certification  environmental matters  radio communications and other factors 
certificates of necessity may be required from state or local governments to operate ambulance services in a designated service area 
master contracts from governmental authorities are subject to risks of cancellation or unenforceability as a result of budgetary and other factors and may subject us to certain liabilities or restrictions that traditionally have applied only to governmental bodies 
federal  state  local  or foreign governments could change existing laws or regulations  adopt new laws or regulations that increase our cost of doing business  lower reimbursement levels  choose to provide services for themselves  or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we could encounter difficulty in complying with all applicable laws and regulations 
health care reforms and cost containment may affect our business 
numerous legislative proposals have been considered that would result in major reforms in the us health care system 
we cannot predict which  if any  health care reforms may be proposed or enacted or the effect that any such legislation would have on our business 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which protects the privacy of patients health information handled by health care providers and establishes standards for its electronic transmission  was enacted on august  the final rule  which took effect on april   requires covered entities to comply with the final rule s provisions by april   and covers all individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by a covered entity 
our hipaa subcommittee of the corporate compliance committee is addressing the impact of hipaa and considering changes to or enactment of policies and or procedures which may need to be implemented to comply under the final rule 
because the impact of hipaa on the health care industry is not known at this time  we may incur significant costs associated with implementation and continued compliance with hipaa or further legislation which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
in addition  managed care providers are focusing on cost containment measures while seeking to provide the most appropriate level of service at the most appropriate treatment facility 
changing industry practices could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
on july   the nasdaq stock market notified us that we were not in compliance with a nasdaq smallcap maintenance standard 
this standard requires that we maintain at least a minimum bid price 
under the nasdaq notice  we had until october  to comply with the maintenance requirement 
in order to comply  our common stock had to trade above for at least ten consecutive trading days prior to such date 
on september   nasdaq announced  effective immediately  it was implementing an across the board moratorium on the minimum bid and public float requirements for continued listing on nasdaq 
in particular  companies that were under review for failure to maintain such requirements  as we were  had been removed from the compliance process with respect to the bid price and public float requirements 
the suspension of these requirements remained effective until january   and no deficiencies accrued during the suspension period 
on february   we announced that the company had received notification from nasdaq citing our inability to meet continued listing standards for net tangible assets  stockholders equity  market capitalization  or net income  as set forth in marketplace rule c b 
we subsequently submitted our request for a nasdaq qualifications panel hearing to consider our continued listing 
a hearing was set for april   at which time we presented our case for continued listing 
on april   the company announced that the panel had determined our securities would continue to be listed under the ticker symbol rurlc on the nasdaq smallcap market via an exception to the bid price and net income shareholders equity market capitalization requirements 
in its decision to grant an exception  the panel determined that that our securities would continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market pursuant to the following exceptions specifically  we were granted an exception to demonstrate full compliance with the  net income standard for the fiscal year ending june   excluding extraordinary or non recurring items 
as disclosed in this filing  we reported net income of million before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
nasdaq also required that we evidence year to date net income of at least  at the close of its fiscal third quarter ended march  on may   we were notified by nasdaq that we had evidenced compliance with the necessary requirement 
thirdly  nasdaq required that we evidence on or before august  a closing bid price of at least per share and maintain that price for a minimum of consecutive trading days 
on august   we were notified by nasdaq that we had met this requirement for continued listing and the exception would be continued through september  upon the filing of this form k for the fiscal year ended june   nasdaq will review our financial statements in order to determine full compliance with the exception 
nasdaq has informed us that the listing qualifications panel reserves the right to modify or extend the terms of this exception 
in order to fully comply with the terms of this exception  we must demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market as well as the ability to sustain compliance with those requirements over the long term 
we believe we will evidence compliance with the requirements as set forth by nasdaq and therefore will return to continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in the event we are unable to do so  its securities will be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
we depend on certain business relationships 
we depend to a great extent on certain contracts with municipalities or fire districts to provide emergency ambulance services and fire protection services 
our six largest contracts accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  one of these contracts accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended contracts with municipalities or fire districts may have certain budgetary approval constraints 
failure to allocate funds for a contract may adversely affect our ability to continue to perform services without suffering significant losses 
the loss or cancellation of several of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  and results of operations 
we may not be successful in retaining our existing contracts or in obtaining new contracts for emergency ambulance services or for fire protection services 
our contracts with municipalities and fire districts and with managed care organizations and health care providers are short term or open ended or for periods ranging from two years to five years 
during such periods  we may determine that a contract is no longer favorable and may seek to modify or terminate the contract 
when making such a determination  we may consider factors  such as weaker than expected transport volume  geographical issues adversely affecting response times  and delays in implementing technology upgrades 
we face certain risks in attempting to terminate unfavorable contracts prior to their expiration because of the possibility of forfeiting performance bonds and the potential adverse political and public relations consequences 
our inability to terminate or amend unfavorable contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we also face the risk that areas in which we provide fire protection services through subscription arrangements with residents and businesses will be converted to tax supported fire districts or annexed by municipalities 
we face risks associated with our prior rapid growth  integration  and acquisitions 
we must integrate and successfully operate the ambulance service providers that we have acquired 
the process of integrating management  operations  facilities  and accounting and billing and collection systems and other information systems requires continued investment of time and resources and can involve difficulties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
unforeseen liabilities and other issues also could arise in connection with the operation of businesses that we have previously acquired or may acquire in the future 
for example  we recently became aware of  and have taken corrective action with respect to  various issues arising primarily from the transition to us from various acquired operations of federal communications commission fcc licenses for public safety and private wireless radio frequencies used in the ordinary course of our business 
while we do not currently anticipate that action with respect to these issues by the fcc s enforcement bureau will result in material monetary fines or license forfeitures  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our acquisition agreements contain purchase price adjustments  rights of set off  indemnification  and other remedies in the event that certain unforeseen liabilities or issues arise in connection with an acquisition 
however  these purchase price adjustments  rights of set off  indemnification  and other remedies expire and may not be sufficient to compensate us in the event that any liabilities or other issues arise 
we face additional risks associated with our international operations 
due to the deteriorating economic conditions and continued devaluation of the local currency  we have reviewed our strategic alternatives with respect to the continuation of operations in latin america  including argentina and bolivia 
we have determined that we would benefit from focusing on our domestic operations 
effective september   we sold our latin american operations to local management 
while the accounting for this transaction has not been finalized  we do not expect this transaction to have a negative impact 
we believe that both the structure of our pre sale operations and of the sale transaction itself shield us from liabilities associated with past or future activities of our former latin american operations 
however  due to the nature of local laws and regulatory requirements and the uncertain economic and political environment  particularly in argentina  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to defend against future claims 
unanticipated claims successfully asserted against us could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
the ambulance service industry is highly competitive 
ambulance and general transport service providers compete primarily on the basis of quality of service  performance  and cost 
in order to compete successfully  we must make continuing investments in our fleet  facilities  and operating systems 
we believe that counties  fire districts  and municipalities consider the following factors in awarding a contract quality of medical care  historical response time performance  customer service  financial stability  and personnel policies and practices 
we currently compete with the following entities to provide ambulance services governmental entities including fire districts  hospitals  other national ambulance service providers  large regional ambulance service providers  and local and volunteer private providers 
municipalities  fire districts  and health care organizations that currently contract for ambulance services could choose to provide ambulance services directly in the future 
we are experiencing increased competition from fire departments in providing emergency ambulance service 
some of our current competitors and certain potential competitors have or have access to greater capital and other resources than us 
tax supported fire districts  municipal fire departments  and volunteer fire departments represent the principal providers of fire protection services for residential and commercial properties 
private providers represent only a small portion of the total fire protection market and generally provide services where a tax supported municipality or fire district has decided to contract for these services or has not assumed the financial responsibility for fire protection 
in these situations  we provide services for a municipality or fire district on a contract basis or provide fire protection services directly to residences and businesses who subscribe for this service 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able continue to maintain current contracts or subscription or to obtain additional fire protection business on a contractual or subscription basis  fire districts or municipalities will not choose to provide fire protection services directly in the future  or areas in which we provide services through subscriptions will not be converted to tax supported fire districts or annexed by municipalities 
we depend on our management and other key personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
we could experience difficulty in retaining our current key personnel or in attracting and retaining necessary additional key personnel 
low unemployment in certain market areas currently makes the recruiting  training  and retention of full time and part time personnel more difficult and costly  including the cost of overtime wages 
our internal growth will further increase the demand on our resources and require the addition of new personnel 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and certain other key personnel 
failure to retain or replace our key personnel may have an adverse effect on our business 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  shareholders rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control might be beneficial to stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on our borrowing activities 
we face the possibility of increased interest expense in connection with our amended credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 
a increase in the prime rate would increase our interest expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
the remainder of our debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
we continually monitor this risk and review the potential benefits of entering into hedging transactions  such as interest rate swap agreements  to mitigate the exposure to interest rate fluctuations
