overview we are a leader in the application of directed molecular evolution to the optimization and development of biotherapeutics 
directed molecular evolution is a process by which genes and proteins are optimized for specific commercial purposes 
we focus principally on applying our technology to human biotherapeutics  the largest and most profitable target market for directed molecular evolution 
since our formation  we have expended considerable resources on the development of our amesystem technology and the development of vitaxin  a product candidate engineered from an antibody we licensed from the scripps research institute 
much of our research and development from to was allocated to preclinical development and initial clinical trials for vitaxin 
in  we licensed vitaxin to medimmune  which is responsible for future clinical development expenses and commercialization 
in  medimmune initiated phase i clinical trials with an improved  second generation version of vitaxin that we enhanced using our amesystem technology 
to date we have generated revenue from corporate collaborations  product and technology licenses  prepaid royalties and government grants 
we have corporate collaborations with medimmune  eli lilly  chiron  cancervax  biosynexus  bristol myers squibb  seattle genetics and aventis pharmaceuticals  inc  the final one through our majority owned subsidiary  novasite 
we have licensed intellectual property to biosite incorporated  formerly biosite diagnostics  inc  in exchange for a nonrefundable  prepaid  fixed royalty which is being recognized over six years  the estimated useful lives of the related patents 
our government grants have come from the national institutes of health 
research funding from corporate collaborators and government grants is recognized as revenue when the services are rendered 
we have incurred losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and this accumulated deficit resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development of our technology platform and the preclinical and clinical development of vitaxin 
we expect these losses to increase as we continue to invest in our amesystem technology and internal development projects 
on august   we entered into an operating agreement with torrey view phase ii  lp  to establish ame torrey view  llc torrey view 
torrey view is a owned subsidiary and is consolidated in the company s financial statements

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  patent costs and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
patent costs we capitalize the costs incurred to file patent applications 
these costs are amortized over a six year estimated life from the date of patent issuance 
at december   capitalized costs related to issued patents total approximately  net of accumulated amortization and approximately  related to unissued patents 
our results of operations could be materially impacted when we begin amortizing the costs related to unissued patents 
in addition  we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of the abandonment 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments and interest earned thereon  together with funding received from collaborators and government grants will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next two years 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and government and nongovernment debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was approximately two years 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rates arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense
