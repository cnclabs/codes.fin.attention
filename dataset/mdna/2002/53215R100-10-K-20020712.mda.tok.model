item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources until december   the company had been a development stage enterprise with no revenue history 
until recently  the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to research and development and has experienced an ongoing deficiency in working capital 
the company has just begun generating revenue from product sales 
there can be no assurance as to when the company will achieve profitability  if at all 
prior to december   the company had not produced any revenues as a result of its being a development stage company 
the company had been dependent on the net proceeds derived from seven private placements pursuant to regulation d under the securities act to fund its operations 
the succeeding three paragraphs describe the private placements in fiscal  and on february and march   the company closed as to sales at  per unit of an aggregate of  units  each unit consisting of  shares of the common stock and a common stock purchase warrant expiring february or march  to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants were not exercisable prior to september  and the shares included in the units were restricted securities for at least one year 
the company realized  in gross proceeds 
finders fees were paid to various consultants and bankers for their assistance in helping the company to complete this private placement consisting of an aggregate of  in cash fees and common stock purchase warrants expiring march  to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the common stock at per share 
as a result of the  in gross proceeds realized in the company s fourth private placement which was closed in february and march  management believed  as the company had previously announced  that the company had sufficient funds to complete the commercialization of its testing product and bring the same to market 
this expectation has proven to be correct 
however  as the company had also previously reported  the company also required additional funds to bridge the gap between the time the impact test system was first brought to market and the time the resultant revenues from sales of such product resulted in profitability 
in june  the company closed an initial round of a private placement and in september  closed the final round of the private placement 
the company realized  in gross proceeds less  in expenses related to the private placement from the sale of units each unit consisting of  shares of the series c preferred stock and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase  shares of the common stock 
the company had previously realized  in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of the then designated series b preferred stock 
however  the  purchase price for these shares was applied to purchase units of the series c preferred stock and the shares of series b preferred stock were cancelled and the related common stock purchase warrants surrendered 
on april   the company sold units  at  per unit  to eight accredited investors 
each unit consisted of  shares of the common stock and a common stock purchase warrant expiring april  to purchase  shares of the common stock at per share 
the company realized  in gross proceeds from the private placement 
the company has closed this offering and no further units will be offered 
as a result  management believes that the net proceeds from the offerings  together with certain other sources of funds  will be sufficient to enable the company to reach the period when the company can reasonably expect to achieve profitability 
there can be no assurance that management s estimate as to costs and timing will be correct 
however  if there are any additional delays in the company meeting its timetable  the company may require additional funding 
the company has entered into a strategic partnering agreement with cmi to distribute the company s products exclusively to the law enforcement market 
based on its initial forecasts  cmi will make payments of approximately million to lifepoint over a two and one half year period 
however  there can be no assurance that cmi will make payments approximating that amount 
fees will be calculated and paid in accordance with the confidential terms of the agreement 
there are no conditions for the company to meet other than the delivery of product to receive the fees 
cmi has minimum  confidential  sales requirements for the three year term of the contract in order to retain the exclusive marketing rights 
additionally  the company continues to pursue additional strategic partnering for other markets 
however  there can be no assurance when and if such arrangements will be made 
management has investigated the possibility of an underwritten public offering and has received expressions of interest from several well known firms  but only on a post revenue basis 
however  because the market currently is not generally receptive to public offerings  there can be no assurance that stock market conditions in will be receptive to a public offering by the company  especially in view of the general volatility of the financial markets in and in addition  competitive conditions may make the company less attractive to potential public investors 
see the section competition under the caption business in this report 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful  if required  in securing additional financing  whether through a capital leasing firm  a strategic partner  a public offering or a private placement 
on march  and june   the compensation committee authorized that executive officers and senior staff designated as significant employees  who are optionees under the lifepoint  inc stock option plan the option plan and the option plan  respectively  or who hold common stock purchase warrants may exercise an option or a warrant by delivering a promissory note the note to the order of the company 
as of march  notes totaling  were due to the company with various due dates from march  through august  bearing interest rates ranging from to 
all notes have a term of eighteen months 
a detailed list of the notes due from officers and senior staff may be found in item certain relationships and related transactions 
all other notes previously issued have been fully repaid  including interest payments 
if all of the common stock purchase warrants that were outstanding on march  were subsequently exercised  shares  the company would realize  in gross proceeds 
if all of the options pursuant to the company s two stock option plans to purchase an aggregate of  shares outstanding on march  were subsequently exercised  the company would realize  in gross proceeds 
however  there can be no certainty as to when and if any of these securities may be exercised  especially as to the options  which were not all currently exercisable as of march  accordingly  management believes that the company cannot rely on these exercises as a source of financing

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the financial statements

future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements
