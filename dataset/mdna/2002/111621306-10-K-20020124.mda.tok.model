item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  october  october  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation facilities lease losses and other charges total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net loss on investments  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our silkworm family of products 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased to million  an increase of percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  net revenues for the year ended october   represented an increase of percent over net revenues of million for the year ended october  these increases in net revenues reflect increased demand for san switching products and are the result of increased unit sales to several oem and fabric integrator customers  and to an expanding customer base 
the increases in unit sales have been partially offset by declining average unit selling prices 
domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  for the year ended october  for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  and for the year ended october   substantially all of our revenues were domestic 
international revenues primarily consisted of sales to countries in western europe and asia 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer to which product is shipped 
domestic revenues include sales to certain oem customers who then distribute product to their international customers 
a significant portion of our revenues is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers 
for the year ended october   three customers each contributed over percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
for the year ended october   two customers each contributed over percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues  and for the year ended october   three customers each contributed over percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
the level of sales to any single customer may vary and the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any one significant customer  could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to come from sales of products to a relatively small number of customers 
in 
table of contents addition  hp and compaq  two of our oem customers  have announced their intent to merge  which could result in a disruption in our sales to these two customers 
in recent quarters  unfavorable economic conditions and reduced information technology it spending rates in the united states  europe  and asia have lead to a decline in our growth rates compared to historical trends 
we are unable to predict when it spending rates will return to historical levels  if at all 
product revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
however  revenue recognition is deferred for shipments to new customers and for shipments of next generation products to existing customers when significant support services are required to successfully integrate our product into our customer s products 
these revenues  and related costs  are deferred and recognized when the customer has successfully integrated our product into its product offerings and we have met our support obligations 
in addition  revenue from sales to master resellers is recognized upon reported sell through 
our post sales obligations are generally limited to product warranties 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period  generally one to three years 
warranty costs  sales returns  and other allowances are accrued based on experience at the time of shipment 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to percent for the year ended october   compared with percent and percent for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
the increases were primarily due to lower component and manufacturing costs and the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs over a greater revenue base  partially offset by declines in average unit selling prices of our products 
gross margin for the year ended october  was adversely affected by charges for inventory reserves and charges related to the accrual of purchase commitments for excess inventory components used in the manufacture of our gbit sec related products as a result of an accelerated transition of our product offerings from to gbit sec technology 
during the fourth quarter ended october   we announced the general availability of our silkworm enterprise fabric switch 
the silkworm is the first in an expected family of gbit sec per second products 
subsequent to its introduction we realized that our customers would transition from to gbit sec technology more rapidly than we had previously expected 
we expect this product will accelerate the market demand for gbit sec products 
as a result of this expected accelerated transition of product offerings from to gbit sec technologies  our gross margin for the year ended october  was adversely affected by a charge of million recorded during the fourth quarter ended october   related to the accrual of purchase commitments for excess inventory components used in the manufacture of our gbit sec related products 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in r d expenses reflect our belief that continued investment in research and development is a critical factor in maintaining our competitive position 
we currently anticipate that r d expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and increased direct selling expenses  such as commissions  associated with increased revenues 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to the success of our strategy to expand relationships with our oem customers  to expand our presence in the fabric integration channel  to communicate with  understand and anticipate the current and future needs of the end users of our products in order to increase demand for our partners  and to maintain 
table of contents our leadership position in the san market 
in addition  during the year ended october   we began expanding our international sales activities in various countries in europe and the asia pacific region 
we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in g a expenses were primarily due to additional headcount and other expenses necessary to manage and support increased levels of business activity 
we currently anticipate that g a expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but will remain relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees during the year ended october   we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
no additional deferred stock compensation was recorded during the years ended october   or october  deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
for each of the years ended october   and october   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  and for the year ended october   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
at october   unamortized deferred stock compensation was million 
facilities lease losses and other charges 
during the year ended october   we experienced the impact of unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates 
as a result of these continuing unfavorable economic conditions and our reevaluation of future employee hiring in terms of timing and geographic location  we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facility requirements and identified excess facility space  which has been offered for sublease 
factors considered in the analysis included  but were not limited to  anticipated future revenue growth rates  anticipated future headcount requirements in terms of both headquarters and field personnel  and anticipated sublease terms and time to sublease based upon current market conditions 
based upon the results of this analysis and the excess facilities space identified  during the fourth quarter ended october   we recorded a charge of million related to facilities lease losses and the impairment of certain related assets see note  facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statement 
the facilities lease losses and related asset impairment charges are estimates in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and represent the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of a future triggering event 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
should operating lease rental rates continue to decline in current markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility  adjustments to the facilities lease losses reserve will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon the then current actual events and circumstances 
we have estimated that under certain circumstances the facilities lease losses could increase to million 
also during the fourth quarter ended october   we announced the general availability of our silkworm enterprise fabric switch  the first in an expected family of gbit sec per second products 
as a result of the expected accelerated transition of our product offerings from to gbit sec technology  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to the impairment of certain gbit sec related equipment no longer used in research and development and sales and marketing efforts see note  facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million for the year ended october   and million for the year ended october  these increases were primarily the result of higher average cash and short term investment balances  partially offset by declining interest rates 
we currently anticipate that both interest income and interest expense will increase in future periods as a result of the million in convertible 
table of contents subordinated notes that we sold in private placements on december   and january  see note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss on investments  net 
net loss on investments for the year ended october   consisted of impairment losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million  partially offset by realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities of million 
we have made certain minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to or broaden the markets for our products  and to promote our business and strategic objectives 
these minority equity investments in non public companies are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are carried at cost  and are accounted for under the cost method 
we hold less than percent of the voting equity of such companies  and neither have nor seek corporate governance or significant influence over their respective operating and financial policies 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a quarterly basis and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when such impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
factors used in determining an impairment include  but are not limited to  the current business environment including competition and uncertainty of financial condition  going concern considerations such as the inability to obtain additional private financing to fulfill the investee s stated business plan and cash burn rate  the need for changes to the respective investee s existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes  and comparable valuations 
if an investment is determined to be impaired  a determination is made as to whether such impairment is other than temporary 
during the year ended october   we made minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million 
our investments were made primarily in companies in the storage networking  internet infrastructure  fabless semiconductor  networking services  and managed storage services industries 
these companies were  and continue to be  development stage companies with significant risks 
during the year ended october   the industries in which these companies compete experienced considerable market declines associated with a depressed macroeconomic environment and there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing of any recovery 
many of these companies had spent the majority of their funding on operating activities and or lost key business partners due to bankruptcy  and we determined that the carrying value of our investments were impaired 
based upon current market conditions and substantial doubt about these companies ability to raise additional funding  achieve positive cash flow  and achieve projected revenues  we concluded the impairments were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million 
the impairment charges reduced the carrying value of our investments to the estimated fair value 
at october   and october   the carrying values of our minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies were million and million  respectively 
if the companies with whom we have remaining investments are unable to raise additional capital  or if the results of operations and financial condition of these companies continue to decline  and market conditions do not improve  we may incur additional impairment charges in our investment portfolio in the future 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended october   compared with percent and percent for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
our effective tax rates have historically differed from the federal statutory rate for various reasons see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended october   our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the inability to benefit certain losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies 
we currently expect an effective tax rate of approximately percent for the fiscal year ending october  our ability to realize this percent tax rate requires that international revenues and earnings be achieved as planned 
to the extent that international revenues and earnings differ from plan  a factor largely influenced by the buying behavior of our oem customers  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our tax rate could change 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at october   an increase of million over the prior year amount of million 
for the year ended october   we generated million in cash from operating activities  primarily from net income before non cash charges related to facilities lease losses and asset impairments  and net impairment losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies 
also included in cash from operations were income tax benefits related to employee stock option transactions offset by an increase in deferred tax assets 
at october   we had million in deferred tax assets  which we believe will be will be realizable through profitable future operations 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and was primarily the result of million invested in capital equipment and million invested in minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies  partially offset by net maturities of short term investments of million and proceeds from sales of marketable equity securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock plans 
we have entered into various agreements to lease our headquarters facilities in san jose  california 
in connection with these lease agreements  and subsequent amendments  we have signed unconditional  irrevocable letters of credit totaling million as security for the leases see note commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have a manufacturing agreement with solectron corporation solectron under which we provide to solectron a twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
although the purchase orders we place with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement require us to purchase from solectron all unused inventory components not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
at october   our commitment to solectron for such inventory components was million  net of purchase commitment reserves  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
independently of solectron  we purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products 
at october   we had non cancelable purchase commitments for various components totaling million  net of purchase commitment reserves  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
we have established purchase commitment reserves for excess inventory component commitments to solectron and other key component vendors that we believe may not be realizable during future normal ongoing operations 
our commitments to solectron and other key component vendors are based on our current forecasts of revenue 
to the extent that such forecasts are not achieved  our commitments and associated reserve levels may change 
on december   and january   we sold  in private placements pursuant to section of the securities act of  as amended  million in aggregate principal amount of percent convertible subordinated notes due the initial purchasers of the notes were morgan stanley co 
incorporated  goldman  sachs co  salomon smith barney  inc and merrill lynch  pierce fenner and smith incorporated  who purchased the notes from us at a discount of percent of the aggregate principal amount 
holders of the notes may  in whole or in part  convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes at any time prior to maturity on january  we are required to pay interest on january and july of each year  beginning july  we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering of million for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and the expansion of sales and marketing  the

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of us interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk 
as such  our short term investments consist of us treasury and federal agency debt securities with original maturity dates between three months and one year 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that market risk due to changes in interest rates is not material 

table of contents the following table in thousands presents our cash equivalents and short term investments subject to interest rate risk and their related weighted average interest rates at october  carrying value approximates fair value 
average amount interest rate cash and cash equivalents short term investments total equity security price risk our exposure to market risk due to equity security price fluctuations primarily relates to investments in marketable equity securities 
these investments are generally in companies in the volatile high technology sector 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities 
a percent adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately  in the fair value of marketable equity securities at october
