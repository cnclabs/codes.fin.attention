overview we develop  market and support broadband equipment  software and services that enable our carrier and broadband service provider customers to simplify and enhance the delivery of broadband services to their residential and enterprise class customers 
our product and service offerings enable carriers and broadband service providers to i improve their profitability with feature rich routers and gateways  and software that manages to the edge of the network to reduce costs  and ii provide value added services to enhance revenue generation 
these bundled service offerings often include dsl or broadband cable equipment bundled with backup  bonding  vpn  firewall protection  parental controls  web content filtering  integrated voice and data  and esite and estore hosting 
broadband equipment 
we have developed a comprehensive line of broadband internet gateways  which allow the transport of high speed data over the local  copper loop and enable telecommunications carriers to provide cost effective and high speed services over existing copper infrastructure 
our products support many types of high speed wan interfaces  including connectivity for adsl  shdsl  sdsl  idsl  ethernet  cable  t  fractional t  k dds  dual analog  isdn  and wireless networks 
our broadband internet gateway family includes routers and modems for data services  and iads for combined voice and data services  all of which are designed to deliver high performance  excellent reliability and scalability  all the while maintaining affordability for the customer 
we believe a key to our success is comprehensive interoperability with leading central office equipment and a common firmware platform across all wan connections 
the substantial majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our broadband internet gateways  in particular our dsl routers and modems 
during each of fiscal years  and  revenue from the sale of our broadband internet gateways have accounted for more than of our total revenues 
when reading our statement of operations  revenues and cost of revenues related to the sale of our broadband internet equipment are classified as internet equipment 
broadband services 
our service delivery platform includes the netoctopus suite of broadband gateway  pc management and customer support software solutions  web ecommerce server software and timbuktu software solutions 
netoctopus server software products enable remote support and centralized management of installed broadband gateways  allowing carriers and broadband service providers to manage to the edge of their network 
netoctopus desktop support and ecare software enable broadband service providers and traditional enterprises to support their customers by remotely viewing and operating the customer s desktop computer 
the netopia web ecommerce server solution provides no assembly required web sites and online stores  what we refer to as esites and estores  with a wide variety of vertical market content packages to suit many needs  from franchisees to sole proprietors 
timbuktu software solutions include systems management tools such as remote control  remote computer configuration and file transfer 
during each of fiscal years  and  revenue from the sale of our broadband services have accounted for approximately to of our total revenues 
when reading our statement of operations  revenues and cost of revenues related to the sale of our broadband services are classified as web platform licenses and services 
we sell our products both domestically  in the united states  and internationally  primarily in europe 
we primarily sell our broadband equipment and broadband services to page o telecommunication carriers  including ilecs  such as sbc  bellsouth and verizon  clecs  including covad  mcleod and nextgentel  isps  including bti and integra telecom  and ixcs including at t  sprint and worldcom  o distributors  including ingram micro  softway and tech data  o cable companies  including comcast  and o directly to end users 
historically  we have depended upon the ability of our customers to successfully offer broadband services  in particular dsl services 
in the past  our largest customers have been clecs 
many clecs have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows as they attempted to establish their networks and operations  and many have filed for protection under the bankruptcy act or ceased operations 
most notably  covad  which currently is our largest clec customer  filed a voluntary petition under the bankruptcy act in august as part of a capital restructuring plan 
covad emerged from bankruptcy in december and has announced that it has adequate cash to allow it to become cash flow positive by the latter half of additionally  the financial instability of the telecommunications industry was highlighted when worldcom  inc announced in july that worldcom and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings commenced by worldcom  we recorded a million provision for doubtful accounts during fiscal year  representing of the outstanding accounts receivable owed by worldcom 
in july  the bankruptcy court approved interim financing arrangements that worldcom believes should provide sufficient funds to continue operations 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in revenues from sales of our broadband equipment to worldcom of which  million is related to shipments we approved after worldcom s bankruptcy filings 
as a result of the financial and operational difficulties encountered by many of our clec customers  who had primarily served the business market for dsl services  we have recently acted aggressively to expand our customer base and markets served 
as a result of our acquisition of cayman in october  we have established relationships with ilecs such as bellsouth and sbc  customers with whom we have not had historic relationships for broadband equipment  and have developed new products designed for the residential market for dsl services 
we expect that our continued operations will become substantially dependent upon our ability to develop and enhance products to meet the needs of the residential market for dsl services and requirements of our ilec customers 
the ilecs and our other customers are significantly larger than we are  and are able to exert a high degree of influence over our business 
as a result  our larger customers may be able to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty and force our products to undergo lengthy approval and purchase processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our processes used to develop estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  investments  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  expectations of future results  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of internet equipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from the sale of web platform licenses and services in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in general  software license revenues are recognized when page a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable  professional services revenues are recognized as such services are performed  and maintenance revenues  including revenues bundled with software agreements which entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to the company s products  are deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract period  generally twelve months 
revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the specific objective evidence of the fair values of the elements  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation  or training 
we record unearned revenue for software arrangements when cash has been received from the customer and the arrangement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy 
we record accounts receivable for software arrangements when the arrangement qualifies for revenue recognition and cash or other consideration has not been received from the customer 
we recognize revenue from long term software development contracts using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue as work on the contract progresses 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
on october   we early adopted sfas no 
 which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
the impairment testing is performed in two steps i the determination of impairment  based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  and ii if there is an indication of impairment  this step measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed the transitional impairment test of intangible assets during the three months ended march  that effort  and preliminary assessments of our identifiable intangible assets  indicated no adjustment was required upon adoption of the pronouncement 
we performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
on august  for our two reporting units 
at august   the implied fair value of the internet equipment reporting unit was found to be less than its carrying amount and as a result  we recorded a million charge to our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september  this charge represents full impairment of the remaining goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions of cayman and starnet 
as of september   the remaining carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was million 
we will continue to perform our annual impairment test  as required by sfas no 
 in our fiscal fourth quarter 
impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangibles 
we elected to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on october  sfas no 
serves to clarify and further define the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and test our long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying values or fair values  less costs of disposal 
at september   our identifiable intangible assets consisted of developed product technology  core technology and sales channel relationships related to the acquisition of cayman as well as a certain marketing license 
as a result of the downturn in the economy and the impairment charge recorded in connection with the sfas no 
analysis  we tested our identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and found no impairment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the aging of accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
page non marketable securities 
we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on a stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments  as we do not exert significant influence over these investments 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to management that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had a total carrying value of million as of september   and have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost 
also  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in significant additional impairment charges in the future 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the need for reserves on excess and obsolete inventory based upon monthly forward projections of sales of products 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost includes material costs and applicable manufacturing overheads 
the provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based upon management s analysis of inventory levels  forecasted sales  expected product life cycles and market conditions 
once inventory is reserved  the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory 
provision for income taxes 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the fiscal years  and primarily due to continued substantial uncertainty regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
based upon available objective evidence  there has been sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets to warrant a full valuation allowance in our financial statements 
the factors considered included prior losses  inconsistent profits  and lack of carryback potential to realize our deferred tax assets 
based on our estimates for fiscal year and beyond  we believe the uncertainty regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
at such point  we would also reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance which will result in an income tax benefit 
available for sale securities 
we classify certain of our cash equivalents and all our investments as available for sale 
the securities are carried at cost  which approximates fair value 
the amortized cost of available for sale debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in other income  net 
realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income  net 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in other income  net 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheets  cash flows and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   our principal source of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and a million credit facility from which we had outstanding borrowings of million and million available 
as of november   we had repaid the borrowings outstanding as of september  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the following table sets forth our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of the fiscal years ended september   and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments    page for the fiscal year ended september   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased primarily due to the use of cash to acquire cayman  cash used by our operating activities  and purchases of capital equipment 
we used approximately million of cash in connection with our acquisitions of cayman and dobox  our operating activities  excluding the changes in operating assets and liabilities  used million primarily as a result of a decline in our revenues and associated gross profit  and we purchased million of capital equipment  primarily computer equipment used for a new website hosting location and equipment used in the research and development process 
this use of cash was partially offset by cash provided from borrowings under our credit facility  which at september   totaled million  changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily related to the decrease of inventory and increase of accounts payable and other liabilities  and million primarily provided from common stock sold to employees under our employee stock purchase program 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased primarily due to the use of million  excluding the changes in operating assets and liabilities  to support our operating activities as a result of a decline in our revenues and associated gross profit  paying the expenses related to our terminated merger with proxim and paying severance benefits in connection with the restructuring charge we recorded in our fiscal second quarter of  million for capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment used in the research and development process  million for our long term equity investment in megapath  and million of capitalized software development costs incurred subsequent to the delivery of a working model  under a development agreement with third parties 
this use of cash was partially offset by cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million related to our increased collections of accounts receivable and decrease of inventory  partially offset by increased accounts payable  and million provided from common stock sold to employees under our employee stock purchase program and the exercise of stock options by employees 
we expect to continue to use our credit facility along with our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investments to support our working capital needs in both the short and long term 
additionally  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be less than the balances at september  as we repaid the outstanding borrowings from under our credit facility as of september  and that we will need to use our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our continuing operations 
as of september   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we do not utilize any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we will require additional capital to finance our future growth and fund our ongoing research and development activities during fiscal and beyond 
if our continuing operations cannot generate sufficient capital to meet our needs and if we are unable to reduce our level of expenditures  we will have to seek additional financing which may not be available when needed and  if such financing is available  it may not be available on terms we believe favorable 
if we issue additional stock to raise capital  our existing stockholders percentage ownership in netopia of would be reduced

our targeted range for dso is to days 
page inventories  net 
the following table sets forth our inventories  net as of the fiscal years ended september   and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands inventories  net    inventory turns turns turns turns inventories consist primarily of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
inventories  net have decreased and inventory turns have improved primarily as a result of increased inventory management efforts 
inventory turns decreased in from primarily due to our implementation of inventory management processes to balance inventory levels with actual and expected sales results 
inventory levels may increase in the near future if we cannot correctly forecast expected customer demand or as a result of customer purchase deferrals or delays 
we may have to further borrow against our credit facility to finance expected inventory increases 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
borrowings under credit facility 
the following table sets forth the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of the fiscal years ended september  as of november   we had repaid the borrowings outstanding as of september  increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands borrowings under credit facility  n a n a n a n a on june   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank the credit facility 
pursuant to the credit facility  we may borrow up to million from time to time from silicon valley bank 
the term of the credit facility is two years 
we must maintain an adjusted quick ratio  as defined as the ratio of i our unrestricted cash maintained at silicon valley bank plus cash equivalents maintained at silicon valley bank plus receivables and investments made on our behalf through silicon valley bank s investment product services division isp division to ii our current liabilities plus the outstanding principal amount of any obligations less deferred revenues  of not less than to from june through december  and to from january  to the end of the term 
for the first year of the credit facility  we must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million  the minimum tangible net worth covenant will be reset for the second year of the credit facility 
on december   silicon valley bank waived our default of the tangible net worth covenant for the first year as set forth in the credit facility agreement 
there is no assurance that silicon valley bank will waive any future default of this or any other covenant contained in the credit facility agreement 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate the rate announced by silicon valley bank as its prime rate plus per annum 
the credit limit is determined based on a formula related to the amount of accounts receivable and inventory at any particular time 
we may borrow under the credit facility in order to finance working capital requirements for new products and customers  and otherwise for general corporate purposes in the normal course of business 
commitments as of september   we had commitments that consisted of facilities and equipment under operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through these commitments and obligations are reflected in our financial statements once goods or services have been received or payments related to the obligations become due

internet equipment revenues 
broadband internet equipment revenues decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to declining sales to the clec market and declining average selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes 
sales volumes increased primarily as a result of the customers we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman and new customers in europe 
sales to the clec market  as illustrated in the customer table below  have declined as a result of the operational and financial difficulties encountered by customers such as covad  rhythms netconnections  inc rhythms and northpoint as they attempted to build out dsl networks 
rhythms and northpoint have subsequently ceased operations 
average selling prices are declining primarily as a result of the mix of products sold  price competition from foreign and domestic competitors and customer driven demands 
the mix of broadband internet equipment sales is changing as we begin entering the residential adsl market 
historically  residential class products  and adsl products generally  have carried a lower average selling price than similar business class products 
we expect that we will continue to experience declining average selling prices  primarily as a result of the changing mix of products we sell and price competition from both foreign and domestic suppliers 
we believe that increased sales volumes to the customers acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman and to our new european customers will offset these declines 
web platform license and services 
web platforms revenues increased slightly for fiscal year from fiscal year recurring revenue from the hosting of our esite and estore products increased for fiscal year from fiscal year but was almost equally offset by reduced license sales of our esite and estore products and reduced sales of timbuktu  our system management software 
licensing of our esite and estore products decreased as a result of fewer licensing opportunities available to the dot com type customers to whom we licensed our esite and estore products 
total revenues for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year primarily due to decreased revenues from our broadband internet equipment and web platforms products 
internet equipment revenues 
broadband internet equipment revenue decreased primarily due to declining average selling prices of our broadband internet equipment  particularly our dsl routers  worldwide as a result of price competition and pricing strategies as we entered new markets and channels  decreased sales of our broadband internet equipment products  particularly our dsl routers in the united states  primarily as a result of the financial and operational difficulties encountered by our clec customers such as covad  northpoint and rhythms  and decreased sales of our isdn routers in europe primarily as a result of growing demand for dsl internet services that began to replace the use of isdn internet services in the european markets in which we distribute our broadband internet equipment products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our dsl routers in europe 
web platform license and services 
web platforms revenues decreased primarily due to reduced license sales of our esite and estore products and reduced sales of timbuktu  partially offset by increased recurring revenue from the hosting of our esite and estore products 
sales of our web platforms products decreased as a result of companies reducing their it spending and fewer licensing opportunities available to the dot com type customers to whom we licensed our esite and estore products

revenues from the united states decreased for fiscal from primarily due to declining sales to the clec market and declining average selling prices partially offset by increased sales to customers we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman as discussed above 
international revenues decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to decreased sales of our isdn routers in europe as a result of growing demand for dsl internet services that are replacing the use of isdn internet services in the european markets in which we distribute our broadband internet equipment products as well page as decreased sales of our web platforms products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our dsl routers in europe 
revenues from the united states decreased for fiscal from primarily due to declining average selling prices of our broadband internet equipment  particularly our dsl routers  as a result of price competition and pricing strategies from entering new markets and channels  and decreased sales of our broadband internet equipment products  particularly our dsl routers in the united states  as a result of the financial and operational difficulties encountered by our clec customers as discussed above 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consist primarily of material costs related to our contract manufacturing operations and manufacturing variances 
although our sales volumes increased for fiscal year from fiscal year  total cost of revenues decreased primarily due to declining material costs for our broadband internet equipment as a result of product redesigns and the introduction of new adsl products that have a lower average cost than our other broadband internet equipment  the increased use of contract manufacturing operations in asia where our products can be manufactured less expensively than in the united states and declining component costs 
total cost of revenues decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily as a result of reduced sales volumes of our broadband internet equipment products  reduced manufacturing variances as well as our ability to obtain cost reductions from our contract manufacturers 
gross margin our total gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increased proportion of revenues from our higher margin web platforms products partially offset by the decline of average selling prices of our broadband internet equipment 
internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to declining average selling prices as a result of price competition and pricing strategies as we enter new markets  introduce new products and expand our customer base  increased sales of lower margin adsl products  reduced sales of dedicated router products which carry a higher gross margin than our dsl products as well than slower than planned product transitions to lower cost  higher margin products 
this decrease was partially offset by declining product costs as discussed in the above cost of revenue discussion 
web platform license and services 
web platforms gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to our ability to reduce our costs related to supporting and provisioning our esite and estore products 
our total gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in broadband equipment gross margins partially offset by the decreased proportion of revenues from our higher margin web platforms products 
internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year broadband internet equipment gross margins were adversely affected in fiscal year due to a million inventory charge we recorded in fiscal year related to the discontinuation of certain non dsl products 
excluding the charge we recorded in fiscal year  broadband internet equipment gross margins increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to our ability to obtain cost reductions from our contract manufacturers who build our products 
this improvement in broadband internet equipment gross margin was partially offset by declining average selling prices of our broadband internet equipment worldwide as a result of price competition and pricing strategies as we enter new markets and channels 
web platform license and services 
web platforms gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to reduced volume license sales of our web platforms products and increased costs related to supporting our hosting of esite and estore products 
our internet equipment products have a lower average gross margin than our web platforms products 
accordingly  to the extent we sell more internet equipment than web platforms products  our gross margins would be lower 
in page the past  our gross margin has varied significantly and will likely vary significantly in the future 
our gross margins depend primarily on o the mix of internet equipment and web platforms products sold  o pricing strategies  o increased sales of our residential class broadband internet equipment which historically have had a lower average selling price than our business class broadband internet equipment  o standard cost changes  o new versions of existing products  and o external market factors  including  but not limited to  price competition 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  depreciation and amortization  development related expenses such as product prototyping  design and testing  and overhead allocations 
research and development expenses increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to o increased research and development staff and employee related expenses as a result of our acquisitions of cayman in october and dobox in march and their research and development personnel  and o increased facility and depreciation expenses as a result of the acquisitions of cayman and dobox and their leased facilities and development assets 
these increases were partially offset by reduced product prototyping and design expenses 
additionally  the use of third party contractors was reduced for fiscal year from fiscal year research and development expenses increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to o increased research and development staff and employee related expenses as a result of our acquisitions of starnet in october and weborder in march and their research and development staff  and o increased development expenses related to the dsl iad technology acquired in connection with the starnet acquisition and the e commerce products acquired in connection with the weborder acquisition 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to product and technological development 
we expect research and development costs may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our product offerings 
we believe our process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  and we have not capitalized any internal software development costs to date 
however  during fiscal year  we capitalized million and during fiscal year  we capitalized million of product development costs incurred subsequent to delivery of a working model  under a development agreement with a third party 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and commission expense for our sales force  travel and entertainment  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  customer service and support costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to o decreased sales and marketing headcount and employee related expenses as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses as a result of our restructuring in october  and o decreased marketing programs and activities 
these decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation and equipment maintenance expense related to capital purchases for equipment used in our technical support and service functions 
page selling and marketing expenses increased for fiscal year from primarily due to increased headcount and employee related expenses as a result of our efforts to expand the number of channels through which we sell our products 
these increases were partially offset by reduced advertising and promotional expenses 
we expect selling and marketing expenses may decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of our restructuring and termination of certain employees and increased expense control efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  provisions for doubtful accounts and legal  accounting and insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to reduced incremental provisions for doubtful accounts for outstanding accounts receivable owed by customers that filed voluntary petitions under the bankruptcy act and many of which ceased operations 
included in general and administrative expense for fiscal year is million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expense includes million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts of which million was related to the outstanding accounts receivable of northpoint 
during december  in a private transaction whereby we sold our claim in the northpoint bankruptcy proceedings  we recovered approximately million of the million northpoint receivable for which we had recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to increased incremental provisions for doubtful accounts for outstanding accounts receivable owed by our clec customers who filed voluntary petitions under the bankruptcy act and many of which ceased operations during our fiscal year as well as increased employee related expenses and insurance costs 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expense includes million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts as discussed above and for fiscal year  includes million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts related to the outstanding accounts receivable of jato 
we expect general and administrative expenses may decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of our restructuring and termination of certain employees  relocation to a new  smaller headquarters facility  and increased expense control efforts 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development represents research and development assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of cayman and dobox in fiscal year  and weborder and starnet in fiscal year  that were not technologically feasible at the time of acquisition and had no alternative future use  and as such were expensed at the time of the transaction 
for fiscal year  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price of cayman and approximately million  or  of the purchase price of dobox to acquired in process research and development 
for fiscal year  we allocated a charge of approximately million of the purchase price of weborder and approximately million of the purchase price of starnet to acquired in process research and development 
each of the amounts we allocated to acquired in process research and development in connection with these acquisitions was based upon an independent third party valuation analysis

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year  this amount represents the amortization of intangible assets with identifiable lives related to our acquisition of cayman 
for fiscal years and  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets represents the amortization of both goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of weborder  starnet  serus and netoctopus 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
page we elected to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on october   the beginning of fiscal year sfas no 
requires that goodwill resulting from a business combination no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis and be expensed against earnings when the implied fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
for goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to july   amortization of such goodwill continued through the fiscal year ended september   but ceased on october  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year  this amount represents the full impairment of the remaining goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions of cayman and starnet 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test on august  for the internet equipment and web platform reporting units 
the impairment testing is performed in two steps i the determination of impairment  based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  this step measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
at august   the implied fair value of our internet equipment reporting unit was found to be less than its carrying amount and as a result  we recorded a charge to our consolidated statement of operations in the fiscal year ended september  of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal year  this amount represents the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of weborder  starnet and serus 
as provided under sfas no 
 given the slower than anticipated growth in the market for iad products the technology for which we acquired from starnet and the rapid and sharp decline in the dot com market to which we marketed and licensed certain of our web platforms products including technology which we acquired from weborder and serus in addition to the slower than anticipated revenue growth in the market for such products  we determined the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to these acquisitions will not be fully recovered 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million based on the difference of the carrying value and the estimated discounted future operating cash flows of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to these acquisitions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs for fiscal year  restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance benefits recorded in connection with a reduction in the company s workforce of approximately people whose positions were determined to be redundant subsequent to the closing of the cayman acquisition 
for fiscal year  restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance benefits and the costs to exit certain of our business activities and closure of a facility 
we expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs accrued during the fiscal year ended september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
integration costs integration costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of cayman and integrating cayman s customers  systems and operations 
we expect to pay the remaining integration costs accrued during the fiscal year ended september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
terminated merger costs this amount represents the costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger between our company and proxim 
the charge consists primarily of expenses for accounting and legal advisory services  initiation of joint marketing and research and development programs in anticipation of the merger that we had undertaken at the direction of proxim  certain shared merger costs  and other related costs 
we expect to pay the remaining terminated merger costs accrued during the fiscal year ended september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
page other income loss  net other income loss  net consists of interest income we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  interest expense  realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions as well as losses on impaired securities that we deem other than temporary 
loss on impaired securities 
for fiscal year  loss on impaired securities represents a million and a million charge for impaired securities related to our investments in megapath and everdream  respectively 
these impairment charges were recorded in connection with the valuation of megapath and everdream based upon their most recent rounds of financing 
for fiscal year  loss on impaired securities represents the entire loss of our investment in northpoint 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

under eitf  an exit cost was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
additionally  sfas no 
provides that exit and disposal costs page should be measured at fair value and that the associated liability will be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  risk factors in addition to other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business because such factors currently may have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k  and the risks discussed in our other filings with the united states securities exchange commission  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses and negative cash flow 
we may incur losses and negative cash flow in the future 
our failure to significantly increase our revenues or sufficiently reduce our operating expenses will result in continuing losses and negative cash flow 
we incurred losses from continuing operations of million for the fiscal year ended september  and have incurred losses from continuing operations of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our operations used million and million of cash for the fiscal years ended september  and and provided million of cash for fiscal year our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments have decreased to million as of september  from million as of september   which decreased from million as of september  even if we reach profitability and maintain positive cash flow  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may incur negative cash flow in the future particularly to the extent we complete any acquisition opportunities 
as a result of continuing substantial capital expenditures and product development  sales  marketing and administrative expenses  we will need to generate significant revenues to maintain positive cash flow 
we may find it difficult to raise needed capital in the future  which could significantly harm our business 
we must continue to enhance and expand our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position and to increase our market share 
as a result and due to our net losses and use of cash  the continuing operations of our business may require substantial capital infusions 
whether or when we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  we may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities  sale of non strategic assets  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for our operations 
if we issue additional stock or other instruments to raise capital  the percentage ownership in netopia of existing stockholders would be reduced 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from our operations and if we are unable to reduce our level of expenditures  or are unable to borrow or otherwise obtain additional funds to finance our operations when needed  our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected and we would not be able to operate our business 
substantial sales of our broadband internet equipment will not occur unless telecommunications carriers continue substantial deployment of dsl services 
the success of our broadband internet equipment depends upon whether telecommunications carriers deploy dsl and other broadband technologies and upon the timing of the deployment of such technologies 
factors that will impact such deployment include o a prolonged approval process by service providers  including laboratory tests  technical trials  marketing trials  initial commercial deployment and full commercial deployment  o the development of a viable business model for dsl and other broadband services  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain dsl and other broadband services  o the ability of our clec customers to obtain required capital resources  page o cost constraints  such as installation costs and space and power requirements at the telecommunications service provider s central office  o lack of compatibility of dsl equipment that is supplied by different manufacturers  o evolving industry standards for dsl and other broadband technologies  and o government regulation 
demand for dsl services has exceeded the ability of certain telecommunications carriers and isps to deploy services in a timely manner and to provide satisfactory customer service 
we offer to carriers and service provider customers the opportunity to bundle basic dsl connectivity with value added features that enable the provider to bundle differentiated services that will justify higher recurring revenues from end users 
these features include dial backup  vpn  voice over dsl  remote management and configuration  and esite or estore hosting 
we can offer no assurance that our strategy of enabling bundled service offerings will be widely accepted 
if telecommunications carriers do not continue to expand their deployment of dsl and other broadband services  or if additional telecommunications carriers do not offer dsl and other broadband services on a timely basis  then our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
we expect our revenues to become increasingly dependent on our ability to sell our broadband gateway products to ilecs  and we may incur losses if we cannot successfully market and sell our products through ilec channels 
ilecs have been aggressively marketing dsl services principally focusing on residential services 
prior to the acquisition of cayman  we had not sold meaningful quantities of our broadband internet equipment to ilecs in the united states 
as a result of our acquisition of cayman  we have expanded the channels through which we sell our products to include ilec customers  such as sbc and bellsouth  and have committed resources that are focused on expanding our presence in the ilec channel both domestically and internationally in response to changing market conditions 
there continue to be barriers associated with such sales including  but not limited to  lengthy product evaluation cycles  the ability to dislodge competitors whose products are currently being utilized  a long term contract cycle and intense price pressures 
ilecs currently obtain equipment from our competitors  such as thomson  siemens through its efficient networks subsidiary  westell  zyxel  linksys and wire  who have proven to be strong competitors 
there is no guarantee we will be successful in retaining the customers acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman or our ability to successfully expand our presence in the ilec market 
if we fail to retain the customers acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman or fail to penetrate further the ilec market for our products and services  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
we expect our revenues to become increasingly dependent on our ability to develop broadband internet equipment for and successfully enter the residential broadband gateway market 
we have historically developed  marketed and sold business class broadband internet equipment products to clecs serving the business market for dsl internet connectivity 
through our acquisitions of cayman in october and dobox in march  we believe that we have acquired existing customer relationships  products and technology that will enable us to more quickly develop  enhance and market broadband internet equipment products and services to ilecs serving the residential market 
there are numerous risks associated with our entrance into the residential broadband gateway market such as o the ability to design and develop products that meet the needs of the residential market  o the ability to successfully market these products to ilecs currently serving this market  o the ability to dislodge current suppliers of residential class broadband gateways  and o our failure to successfully complete and bring to market the products and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions of cayman and dobox 
if we are unable to overcome these challenges or if the ilecs are unsuccessful marketing or deploying dsl services into the residential market  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
page the dsl market  and the channels through which we historically have sold our dsl products  has experienced significant business difficulties during the past year  which have negatively affected our business and operating results 
prior to our acquisition of cayman in october  our most significant customers were clecs and isps 
since the middle of calendar year  clecs have experienced significant business difficulties due to an inability to obtain financing to continue to build out their networks 
the difficulties of these customers have materially and adversely affected our operating results  causing a significant decline in the price of our common stock 
during the last two years  three of our clec customers  covad  rhythms  and northpoint have demonstrated the following market difficulties o covad  our largest customer in fiscal years  and  has reduced its breadth of network build out and significantly scaled back its operations 
in addition  covad filed a voluntary petition under the bankruptcy act in august as part of a capital restructuring plan 
in november  covad announced that it had secured an agreement with sbc to provide covad with million in funding 
covad emerged from bankruptcy in december upon closing the sbc funding 
additionally  covad has announced that this funding is expected to provide the cash that it believes will allow it to become cash flow positive by the latter half of  o rhythms voluntarily filed for protection under the bankruptcy act in august  and subsequently ceased normal operations in september in december  worldcom purchased rhythms key dsl assets 
as a result  worldcom has been delivering service to customers on the rhythms network 
in july  worldcom and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
there is no certainty that worldcom will continue to purchase our equipment for deployment on the rhythms network  and there is no certainty that worldcom will continue to operate the rhythms network as a result of the pending bankruptcy proceedings  and o northpoint voluntarily filed for protection under the bankruptcy act in january and subsequently ceased operations in march like the clecs  isps also have struggled for the past two years 
most isps have had significant difficulties in differentiating their services from the services provided by their competitors 
as a result  the lack of differentiation has led to significant erosion in the prices charged to customers 
many of our isp customers such as mpower communications corp  psinet  inc psinet  onsite access inc and bti  have all experienced business difficulties and some have filed for bankruptcy or ceased operations 
psinet  which had been one of our key isp customers  filed a voluntary petition under the bankruptcy act in june  and no longer is purchasing products from us 
the pricing pressure for isps continues to date  and  accordingly  sales of our products to isps remain difficult 
the financing market for clecs and isps has remained difficult and has been largely closed in calendar years and  resulting in significantly decreased sales to clecs and isps and write offs of outstanding accounts receivable 
if we are unable to retain our customers and or employees and complete our projects and products in development  our business would be seriously harmed 
we have attempted to expand the channels through which and markets to which we sell our products through our acquisitions and product development and marketing efforts 
historically  we have focused on serving the small and medium size business market primarily through the clec channels from which we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue 
the cayman acquisition in october  helped to expand our customer base to include ilec customers  such as sbc and bellsouth 
our recent product introductions have helped us win new customers in europe 
if we are unable to retain our customers and or employees  maintain the quality of our products and timely and successfully develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance of our new products  our business will be seriously harmed 
page the loss of  or decline in  purchases by one or more of our key distributors or customers would result in a significant decline in our revenues 
our revenues will decline and we may incur losses if we lose one or more of our significant customers or if our customers reduce or delay purchases of our products 
for the fiscal year ended september   there were four customers who each individually represented at least of our revenues and in the aggregate  accounted for of our total revenues 
in fiscal year  sales to covad and ingram micro represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate because of many factors and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of any one quarter or series of quarters as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  quarters or year our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
variations in our operating results will likely be caused by factors related to the operation of our business  including o variations in the timing and size of orders for our broadband internet equipment products  o decreases or delays in purchases by significant customers  or loss of customers such as covad  ingram micro  sbc or bellsouth  o increased price competition for our broadband internet equipment products  o our ability to license  and the timing of licenses  of our web platforms products  o the growth rate in the number of esites and estores that are built using our web platforms products from which we derive revenues  o the mix of products and services and the gross margins associated with such products and services  including the impact of our increased sales of lower margin broadband internet equipment products as a percentage of our total revenues and increased sales of lower margin adsl products within our family of broadband internet equipment products  o shifts in the channel fulfilling demand from small  medium and distributed enterprises for dsl services to entities with whom we do not have historical relationships  o the price and availability of chip sets and other components for our dsl products  o the timing and size of expenses  including operating expenses and expenses of developing new products and product enhancements  and o our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
these variations may also be caused by factors related to the development of the market for broadband internet equipment  the market for our web platforms products and the competition we face in these markets  including o the ability of clecs to obtain required capital resources  o the timing  rate and ability of telecommunications service providers to deploy dsl and other broadband services  o anticipated price and promotion competition in the market for broadband internet equipment and web platforms products  o the level of market penetration of our broadband internet equipment and web platforms products relative to those of our competitors  and page o the timing and rate of deployment of alternative high speed data transmission technologies  such as cable and high speed wireless data transmission 
these variations may also be caused by other factors affecting our business  many of which are substantially outside of the control of our management  including o foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations which may make our dollar denominated products more expensive in those foreign markets where we sell our products in united states dollars or could expose us to currency rate fluctuation risks to the extent we do not adequately hedge these foreign currency sales  o costs associated with future litigation  including securities litigation or litigation relating to the use or ownership of intellectual property  o acquisition costs or other non recurring charges in connection with the acquisition of companies  products or technologies  and o general global economic conditions that could adversely affect sales to our customers 
because the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and some of our competitors are larger  better established and have more cash resources  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
we sell products and services in markets that are highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and service offerings and new competitors enter the market 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size  scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
in the market for broadband internet equipment  we primarily compete with thomson  cisco  siemens through its efficient networks subsidiary  linksys  wire  westell  and zyxel 
in the market for our web platforms products  we primarily compete with computer associates  microsoft  vector networks  stac software  symantec  and tivoli software a wholly owned subsidiary of ibm 
we anticipate intense competition from some of these companies because some of these competitors provide their products to consumers at no cost 
for example  microsoft has available at no cost a communications and collaboration software product that could limit the market for our timbuktu product 
many of our current and potential competitors in all product areas have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of these industries 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors in all product areas for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address customer needs 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidation 
the market for integrated voice and data products and combined services may not grow as anticipated 
we have released a line of iads designed to allow for voice and data services over a single dsl line 
to date  service providers have not deployed such combined services broadly and the market has grown more slowly than anticipated 
unless such products and services are broadly deployed  our integrated voice and data products and combined services may not have a meaningful commercial impact  and our business may be harmed 
other technologies for the broadband gateway market compete with dsl services 
dsl services compete with a variety of different broadband services  including cable  satellite and other wireless technologies 
many of these technologies compete effectively with dsl services 
if any technology competing with page dsl technology is more reliable  faster  less expensive  reaches more customers or has other advantages over dsl technology  then the demand for our dsl products and services and our revenues and gross margins will decrease 
there is no guarantee we will be able to develop and introduce products for these competing technologies 
we purchase the semiconductor chips for our dsl products from a limited number of suppliers 
all of our dsl products rely on special semiconductor chips that we purchase from a limited number of suppliers 
we do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our suppliers and they could cease selling us these semiconductor chips at any time 
if we are unable to timely obtain a sufficient quantity of these semiconductor chips from any of our suppliers  for any reason  sales of our dsl products could be delayed or halted 
further  we could also be forced to redesign our dsl products and qualify new suppliers of semiconductor chip sets 
the resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our dsl products would seriously harm our reputation and business 
substantially all of our circuit boards are manufactured by a limited number of contract manufacturers 
substantially all of our broadband internet equipment includes circuit boards that are manufactured by a limited number of contract manufacturers 
additionally  certain of our broadband internet equipment products are assembled and packaged by these contract manufacturers 
if supplies of circuit boards or broadband internet equipment products from these contract manufacturers are interrupted for any reason  we will incur significant losses until we can arrange for alternative sources 
any such interruption may seriously harm our reputation and business 
we may be unable to obtain components for our broadband internet equipment from independent contractors and specialized suppliers 
we do not manufacture any of the components used in our products and perform only limited assembly on some products 
all of our broadband internet equipment relies on components that are supplied by independent contractors and specialized suppliers 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with these third parties and they could cease selling components to us at any time 
moreover  the ability of independent contractors and specialized suppliers to provide us with sufficient components for our broadband internet equipment also depends on our ability to accurately forecast our future requirements 
if we are unable to timely obtain a sufficient quantity of components from independent contractors or specialized suppliers for any reason  sales of our broadband internet equipment could be delayed or halted 
in addition  we may be required to pay premiums for components purchased from other vendors should our regular independent contractors and specialized suppliers be unable to timely provide us with sufficient quantity of components 
to the extent we pay any premiums  our gross margins and operating results would be harmed 
further  we could also be forced to redesign our broadband internet equipment and qualify new suppliers of components 
the resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our broadband internet equipment would seriously harm our reputation and business 
in addition  we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to establish relationships with additional component suppliers in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing these relationships  we may not be able to obtain sufficient components in some future period 
we need to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner to remain competitive 
we compete in markets characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance  reliability  compatibility  and cost savings for our customers 
we will need to continue to integrate our dsl router technology with the architectures of leading central office equipment providers in order to enhance the reliability  ease of use and management functions of each of our dsl products 
currently  our router products are fully integrated with copper mountain networks  inc s central office access concentrators and are interoperable with alcatel  cisco  lm ericsson telephone company ericsson  lucent technologies inc  nortel networks corporation  nokia corporation  paradyne networks  inc and zhone technologies  inc central office access concentrators 
page we have recently developed and introduced a new broadband services platform that enables network operations centers of broadband service providers the ability to remotely manage  support  and troubleshoot installed broadband gateways thereby reducing support costs 
we believe this service delivery platform is new to and has unique features in the market for broadband services and can assist us in differentiating our products and services from those of our competitors 
while this platform is based upon technology developed within netopia or acquired in connection with our recent acquisition of dobox  it is relatively new and we cannot provide any assurance that  when deployed in mass scale  it will perform as expected  there are no hidden bugs or defects  or it will be widely adopted by the customers to whom we are marketing the platform 
we may not be able to successfully develop  introduce  enhance or market these or other products and services necessary to our future success 
in addition  any delay in developing  introducing or marketing these or other products would seriously harm our business 
many of our broadband internet equipment products and services are relatively new 
you should consider our prospects in light of the difficulties we may encounter because these products are at an early stage of development in a relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive market 
for example  we may not correctly anticipate market requirements  including requirements for performance  price  features and compatibility with other dsl equipment 
we may not be able to introduce rapidly innovative new products that meet these market requirements 
it is possible that the market for broadband internet equipment will develop in a manner that we do not anticipate 
we may engage in acquisitions or divestitures that involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  diversion of management attention and significant write offs 
in the past  we have engaged in both acquisitions and divestitures 
for example in december  we acquired netoctopus and serus  in october  we acquired starnet  in march  we acquired weborder  in october  we acquired cayman  and in march  we acquired the assets of dobox 
we also entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization in january under which we agreed to be acquired by proxim 
this agreement was mutually terminated in march in addition  in august  we sold our lan division 
we may continue to acquire companies  technologies or products or to sell or discontinue some of our technologies or products in future periods 
in the past  our acquisitions and divestitures have involved numerous risks  including the use of significant amounts of our cash  diversion of the attention of our management from our core business  loss of our key employees and significant expenses and write offs 
for example  in fiscal year  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development related to our acquisitions of dobox and cayman and a million charge for impairment of goodwill related to our acquisitions of cayman and starnet 
similarly  in september  we recorded a million charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of weborder  starnet and serus 
incremental acquisition related charges including in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles or divestitures of profitable technologies or products could adversely impact our profitability 
the success of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to retain the customers and key employees  and timely and successfully develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance for the products we acquired 
if we engage in additional acquisitions or divestitures in future periods  we may not be able to address these risks and our business may be harmed 
our revenues will not grow and we may incur losses if we cannot successfully introduce  market and sell our web platforms products 
we derive a substantial portion of the recurring revenues from our web platforms products from a small number of large customers 
the majority of our web platforms revenues are derived from the sale of timbuktu 
we anticipate that the market for timbuktu will grow more slowly than the market for our other web platforms products and services 
in addition  we rely on a small number of licensees of our web platforms to promote the use of our web platforms for building esites and estores 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of the recurring revenues from our web platforms products from a small number of large customers 
the extent and nature of the promotions by licensees of our web platforms are outside of our control 
if licensees of our esite and estore web platforms do not successfully promote our esite and estore web platforms to their customers  we will not generate recurring revenues from royalties on esites and estores promoted by licensees of our web platforms 
if these customers were to choose a competitive platform  this could lead to reduced revenues and adversely impact our results 
page if hosting services for our web platforms perform poorly  our reputation will be damaged and we could be sued 
we depend on our servers  networking hardware and software infrastructure  and third party service and maintenance of these items to provide reliable  high performance esite and estore hosting and esupport services for our customers 
in addition  our servers are located at third party facilities 
failure or poor performance by third parties with whom we contract to maintain our servers and hardware and software  could lead to interruption or deterioration of our esite and estore hosting and esupport services 
additionally  a slowdown or failure of our systems due to an increase in the use of the esites and estores we currently host  or due to damage or destruction of our systems for any reason  or the possibility of rolling blackouts could also lead to interruption or deterioration of our esite and estore hosting and esupport services 
if there is an interruption or a deterioration of our esite and estore hosting and esupport services  our reputation would be seriously harmed and  consequently  sales of our products and services would decrease 
if such circumstances do arise in some future period  in order to retain current customers and attract new customers  we may have to provide our esite and estore hosting and esupport services at a subsidized price or even at no cost 
in addition  if our esite and estore hosting or esupport services are interrupted  perform poorly  or are unreliable  we are at risk of litigation from our customers 
we may continue to experience declining gross margins due to price competition and an increase in sales of lower margin broadband internet equipment as a percentage of our total revenue 
we expect that sales of our broadband internet equipment may account for a larger percentage of our total revenues in future periods 
because our broadband internet equipment products are generally sold at lower gross margins than our web platforms products and sales volumes of our lower margin adsl products is increasing  our overall gross margins will likely decrease 
further  we expect that the market for broadband internet equipment  in particular dsl products  will become increasingly competitive and that we will be forced to lower the prices we charge for our broadband internet equipment in the future 
as the average selling price of our routers declines  our gross margins related to such products  as well as our overall gross margins  are likely to decline 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from sales to international customers 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to european and other international customers 
we expect sales to international customers to continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues 
for the past two fiscal years  sales of broadband internet equipment products to our european customers who are members of the european union have been denominated in the euro 
all other international sales are denominated in united states dollars 
for our international sales that continue to be denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products and services to become relatively more expensive to our foreign customers 
this could lead to decreased profitability of our products and services 
in addition  changes in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar could adversely affect our operating results to the extent we do not hedge sales denominated in the euro 
there are risks associated with international operations 
our international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including o costs of customizing products for foreign countries  o laws and business practices favoring local competitors  o dependence on local vendors  o uncertain regulation of electronic commerce  o compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  o longer sales cycles  o greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  o import and export restrictions and tariffs  page o difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  o multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and o political and economic instability 
in addition  if we establish more significant operations overseas  we may incur costs that would be difficult to reduce quickly because of employee related laws and practices in those countries 
we typically experience a seasonal reduction in revenues in the three months ended september in the past  we have experienced a seasonal reduction in our revenues in the three months ended september  our fiscal fourth quarter  primarily due to european vacation schedules that typically result in reduced economic activity in europe during such periods 
we anticipate that this trend will continue 
our success depends on retaining our current key personnel and attracting additional key personnel 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our senior management  product development and sales personnel  particularly alan lefkof  our president and chief executive officer 
none of our employees are bound by an employment agreement  and we do not carry key person life insurance 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  hire  train and retain a substantial number of highly skilled managerial  technical  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
in addition  new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may fail to retain our key employees or to attract or retain other highly qualified personnel 
our intellectual property may not be adequately protected  and our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  and patent  copyright and trademark law 
we presently have one united states patent issued that relates to our timbuktu software 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and there is no guarantee that the safeguards that we employ will protect our intellectual property and other valuable competitive information 
for example  in selling our timbuktu software  we often rely on license cards that are included in our products and are not signed by licensees 
therefore  such licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries where our products are or may be manufactured or sold  particularly developing countries including various countries in asia  such as the people s republic of china  do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products or we infringe their intellectual property 
it is possible that our patent may be successfully challenged  that our patent may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or that the patents of others will seriously harm our ability to do business 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
we may not be able to license necessary software  firmware and hardware designs from third parties 
we rely upon certain software  firmware and hardware designs that we license from third parties  including firmware that is integrated with our internally developed firmware and used in our products to perform key functions 
we cannot be certain that these third party licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially page reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  such licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent firmware is developed  identified  licensed and integrated which would seriously harm our business 
our customers may return our products to us for replacement or refund 
we provide end users of our products with a limited warranty on our broadband internet equipment and our timbuktu software 
we permit end users to return our broadband internet equipment and timbuktu for replacements or for refund of the full purchase price if the products do not perform as warranted 
our other web platforms products are provided on an as is basis  and we generally do not offer a warranty on this product 
end users of our esites and estores generally can discontinue their service at any time at no cost 
in the past  we have not encountered material warranty claims 
in the future  if warranty claims exceed our reserves for such claims  our business would be seriously harmed 
additionally  we attempt to further limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions 
however  we cannot assure you that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects 
our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  defects will not be found in new products or new versions of products following commercial release 
if our products do contain undetected or unresolved defects  we may lose market share  experience delays in or losses of market acceptance or be required to issue a product recall 
in addition  we would be at risk of product liability litigation for financial or other damages to our customers because of defects in our products 
although we attempt to limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions  we cannot assure you that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
substantial sales of our common stock by our large stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 
we have a limited number of stockholders that hold a large portion of our common stock 
to the extent our large stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
our industry may become subject to changes in tariffs and regulations 
our industry and industries on which our business depends may be affected by changes in tariffs and regulations 
for example  we depend on telecommunications service providers for sales of our broadband gateway products  and companies in the telecommunications industry must comply with numerous regulations and pay numerous tariffs 
if our industry or industries on which we depend become subject to increases in tariffs and regulations that lead to corresponding increases in the cost of doing our business or doing business with us  our revenues could decline 
for example  if a regulatory agency imposed restrictions on dsl service that were not also imposed on other forms of high speed internet access  our business could be harmed 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  labor disputes by transportation providers and other events beyond our control 
in particular  our headquarters are located near earthquake fault lines in the san francisco bay area and may be susceptible to the risk of earthquakes 
if there is an earthquake in the region  our business could be seriously harmed 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price may be volatile  which may result in substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control page o variations in our quarterly operating results  o changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  o changes in market valuations of similar companies  o announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations  new products or enhancements  significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o losses of major customers  major projects with major customers or the failure to complete significant licensing transactions  o additions or departures of key personnel  o volatility generally of securities of companies in our industry  o general conditions in the broadband communications industry  in particular the dsl market  or the domestic and worldwide economies  o decreases or delays in purchases by significant customers  o a shortfall in revenue or earnings from securities analysts expectations or other announcements by securities analysts  o our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property or defend against the intellectual property rights of others  and o developments in our relationships with customers  distributors and suppliers 
in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to the expected volatility of our stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future  we may be a target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
a third party may have difficulty acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders
