overview incyte believes it has the largest commercial portfolio of issued united states patents covering human  full length genes  the proteins they encode and the antibodies directed against them 
we intend to leverage our leading intellectual property and genomic information position to be a leader in therapeutic small molecule  secreted protein and antibody discoveries 
in addition  incyte has also developed a leading integrated platform of genomic technologies designed to aid in the understanding of the molecular basis of disease 
these technologies primarily consist of genomic databases and pharmaceutically relevant intellectual property licenses  which help pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers in their therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
these efforts include gene discovery  understanding disease pathways  identifying new disease targets and the discovery and correlation of gene sequence variation to disease 
in december  incyte agreed to settle existing patent infringement litigation with affymetrix  inc involving several of affymetrix s microarray related patents and incyte s rna amplification patents and two additional microarray related patents held by affymetrix 
as a part of the settlement  the companies have agreed to certain non exclusive  royalty bearing licenses and an internal use license under their respective intellectual property portfolios 
this settlement does not include incyte s appeal before the united states district court for the northern district of california seeking de novo review of the board of patent appeals and interferences decision relating to patent applications licensed by incyte from stanford university 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of such an appeal 
during  incyte increased its focus on its therapeutic discovery and development program and its information products  which include licensing a portion of its intellectual property 
as a result  we exited the following activities microarray products and related services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing services  transgenics products and services and snp discovery services 
as a part of the exit of these activities  we have closed certain of our facilities in fremont  california  st 
louis  missouri and cambridge  england 
in addition to the product lines exited  we made infrastructure and other personnel reductions at our other locations resulting in an aggregate workforce reduction of approximately employees 
a non recurring charge for restructure charges and impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the change in focus 
this charge was comprised of the following items million goodwill and intangibles impairment  million nonrecurring restructuring charges including million in equipment and other assets impaired and million impairment of a long lived asset 
as a result of the company s change in strategic direction and restructuring in  pursuant to sfas  incyte performed an assessment of the carrying value of its long lived assets recorded in connection with its hexagen and proteome acquisitions and used in the operations being exited 
equipment and other assets that were disposed of or removed from operations were written down to their estimated fair value of million and that resulted in a charge of million 
the write down of equipment and other assets primarily relates to leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  lab equipment and office equipment associated with the activities being exited and related infrastructure reduction 
additionally  the write off of equipment and other assets also includes certain software costs related to products no longer being offered 
we estimated the fair value of equipment and other assets based on the current market conditions 
in december  we completed the acquisition of proteome  inc  a privately held proteomics database company 
we issued  shares of our common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of proteome s outstanding capital stock 
in addition  we assumed proteome s stock options  which if fully vested and exercised  would amount to  shares of its common stock 
the fair value of the stock options assumed were allocated between additional purchase price and deferred compensation in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
the amount of the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired of approximately million  was allocated to goodwill million  database million  developed technology million  tradename million  and assembled workforce million  which are being amortized over    and years  respectively 
at the time of acquisition  we believed the acquisition would strengthen our database offering with a larger collection of protein annotation information 
in the fourth quarter of  we found that collaborators were unwilling to pay fees to access the proteome databases that were sufficient to support the continued investment required to build and sustain the proteome products 
in addition  we eliminated the positions of approximately of proteome employees 
we consider these events to be indicators of potential impairment and performed a forecast of future cash flows evaluation of the affected long lived assets  which indicated the long lived assets were impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge on the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the proteome acquisition in the amount of million 
the net remaining balance of intangible assets at december  related to this acquisition is million 
the activities acquired through the hexagen acquisition related primarily to a method of snp discovery 
although snp discovery will continue  the hexagen method is one of the activities that will not be continued after the change in strategic direction and restructuring 
as a result  the company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets related to this acquisition have no future cash flows to support their carrying value and a million charge was recorded to write these assets down to their estimated fair value 
in reviewing its existing long lived assets  we determined  based on certain impairment indicators  that an asset related to capitalized software should be analyzed for impairment 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that the net book value of the asset was in excess of future revenues expected from sale of this software reduced by costs to sell 
therefore  it was determined that this capitalized software was impaired and we recognized a million impairment charge 
critical accounting policies and estimates incyte believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
valuation of long lived assets 
accounting for long term investments revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company enters into various types of agreements for access to our information databases  use of our intellectual property and sales of our custom genomics products and services 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenue from database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period 
revenue from licenses to the company s intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of the products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
revenues from custom products  such as clones  are recognized upon completion and delivery 
revenues from custom services are recognized upon completion of contract deliverables 
revenue from gene expression microarray services includes technology access fees  which are recognized ratably over the access term  and progress payments  which are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service in proportion to the costs incurred 
revenues recognized from multiple element contracts are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual element by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
in accordance with sab  when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
when contracts include non monetary exchanges  the non monetary transaction is determined using the fair value of the products and services involved  as applicable 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which includes property and equipment  acquisition related intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant changes in the strategy of our overall business  
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and 
our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  in accordance with sfas  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  included in that amount are assets with a net book value of million that are being marketed for sale 
accounting for long term investments 
we hold equity and debt securities and warrants in companies having operations or technology in areas primarily within our strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and can have volatile share prices 
investments in publicly traded companies are classified as available for sale and are adjusted to their fair value each month based on the their traded market price with any adjustments being recorded in other comprehensive income 
investments in privately held companies are carried at cost  and we monitor the company s financial results and prospects on a regular basis to determine whether an impairment exists 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe that the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
generally  declines that persist for six months or more are considered other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional impairment charges 
results of operations the company recorded net losses for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss per share in and thereafter reflects the dilutive effect of four million shares issued in a february private equity offering 
revenues 
revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues from companies considered to be related parties  as defined by sfas were million 
with respect to incyte  related parties consist of companies in which members of incyte s board of directors have invested  either directly or indirectly  or in which a member of incyte s board of directors is an officer or holds a seat on the board of directors 
revenues received from agreements in which collaborators paid with equity or debt instruments in their company were million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  revenues received from agreements in which the company concurrently invested funds in the collaborator s stock were million and million in and  respectively 
we did not have similar transactions in we also entered into transactions in which we have recognized revenues of million and million in and  respectively  with certain customers from whom we concurrently committed to purchase goods or services of million and million in and  respectively 
of such amounts  we expensed million and million in and  respectively 
we did not have similar transactions in the above transactions were recorded at fair value in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy 
revenues are derived primarily from information products  which include licensing of our intellectual property  and custom genomics 
information products include database subscriptions  licensing  and partner programs and represented  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
custom genomics includes microarray based gene expression products and services  genomic screening products and services  public domain clone products and related services  contract sequencing and snp discovery services and represented  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in information product revenues in from is primarily due to an increase in licensing of our intellectual property 
the increase in revenues from to resulted primarily from database agreements with new customers  revenues from the pfizer partner program  revenues from new products  as well as increased revenues from custom genomics products and services 
revenues for are expected to be in the range of million to million 
this anticipated decrease primarily reflects the impact expected from the exit of custom genomics products and services and from utilizing our information products differently to facilitate our therapeutic discovery and development collaboration and co development efforts 
operating expenses 
total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
total costs and expenses for are currently expected to be in the range of million to million 
this anticipated decrease reflects the reduction in expenses derived from the activities and related infrastructure that were exited in the restructuring and the non recurring restructuring charges and long lived asset write downs in  offset by expanded spending in connection with the therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from over resulted primarily due to having a full year of activity related to the proteome acquisition  which was completed in december  and an increase in the costs related to the company s therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
the increase from over resulted primarily from an increase in bioinformatics and software development efforts  snp discovery efforts  microarray production  partner program expenses  expression database development  an increase in internal disease pathway and therapeutic discovery and development programs  and the development of internet and e commerce products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in over resulted primarily from having a full year of activity related to the proteome acquisition  which was completed in december  and increased legal expenses related to the company s patent infringement cases 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from the growth in the company s sales and marketing function  including its branding efforts  and increased personnel to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses were also impacted by legal expenses related to the company s patent lawsuits with affymetrix  genelogic and invitrogen of approximately million in  and the company s patent infringement lawsuits with affymetrix and genelogic of million and million  in and  respectively 
other expenses 
other expenses of million for the year ended december  represent the charges recorded in connection with the fourth quarter restructuring and long lived asset impairments 
these expenses  of which million were non cash charges  were comprised of the following items million goodwill and intangibles impairment and million non recurring restructuring charges and million impairment of long lived asset 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest and other income expense  interest expense and income tax expense 
total other income expense for the years ended december   and were income of million  million and million  respectively 
total other income expense for is expected to be approximately million to million of income 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december   and  was income of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to the impact of impairment charges recorded in totaling million on long term investments due to declines in values deemed to be other than temporary 
to a lesser degree  the decrease in the cash and marketable securities average balances for and lower interest rates also contributed to the lower interest income 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher interest income  and a gain of million from the sale of one of the company s long term strategic investments 
the higher interest income was primarily due to the convertible debt offering and private equity offering in february resulting in higher cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the small decrease in from is due to a lower average outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes as a result of the timing of issuance in and subsequent repurchases of million in par value  causing the interest thereon to decrease 
the increase in from was primarily due to the interest on the convertible subordinated notes issued by the company in february income taxes 
due to the company s net loss in and  the company had a minimal effective annual income tax rate 
the income taxes for and are attributable to foreign operations 
in  the company had an effective income tax benefit rate of  primarily due to the carryback of the net operating loss 
loss on sale of assets 
loss on the sale of assets of million in resulted from the divestiture of the transgenics product line and the sale of certain of those assets 
there were no significant sales of assets in or gain on certain derivative financial instruments 
gain on derivatives in of million represents the change in fair value of certain long term investments  specifically warrants held in other companies  in accordance with sfas losses from joint venture 
losses from joint venture were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in september  the company formed a joint venture  diadexus  llc diadexus with smithkline beecham corporation 
the loss represents the company s share of diadexus losses from operations 
on april   diadexus converted from an llc to a corporation and completed a private equity financing at which time the company no longer had significant influence over diadexus 
accordingly  the company began accounting for its investment in diadexus under the cost method of accounting as of the date of the financing  and therefore did not include diadexus results of operations in the company s statement of operations subsequent to that date 
extraordinary item  net 
in and  the company repurchased million and million face value of its convertible subordinated notes on the open market  respectively 
the repurchase resulted in a gain of million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cumulative effect of accounting change  net 
the company adopted fasb statement no 
sfas on january  sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value 
the million cumulative effect reported in relates to the recording of warrants held in other companies at fair value upon the adoption of sfas recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
the adoption of this statement on january  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas during the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this statement on january  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  the company has classified all of its marketable securities as short term  as the company may choose not to hold its marketable securities until maturity in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
available cash is invested in accordance with the company s investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increase in net loss in  less non cash restructuring charges and impairment of long lived assets  as well as increases in cash usage for accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increases in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities and the slower increase of accounts receivables in as compared to these were partially offset by the increase in prepaid assets and the decrease in deferred revenue 
the company s investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and net purchases of long term investments 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures decreased in due to lower spending on computer equipment  laboratory equipment and minimal spending on leasehold improvements in and increased in and primarily due to investments in computer equipment and software  laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements related to the expansion of the company s facilities 
long term investments in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the company sold stock in an investment  resulting in proceeds of million and a gain of million  and diadexus repaid its million note to incyte 
in the company liquidated its investment in two such companies  resulting in proceeds of million and a net realized gain of million 
in  the company paid million  net of cash received  in connection with the acquisition of proteome 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans  offset by amounts paid to repurchase convertible subordinated notes 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the company raising additional funds in two financing transactions 
in february  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement  resulting in net proceeds of million 
also in february  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net proceeds from the sale of those shares were million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was due to the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions less than years years over contractual obligations total year years convertible subordinated debt non cancelable operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the company also has purchase commitments of million at december   the timing of which is dependent upon provision by the vendor of products or services 
additionally  the company has committed to purchase equity in certain companies when certain events occur 
the total amount committed at december  was million 
these commitments are considered contingent commitments as a future event must occur in order to cause the commitment to be enforceable 
the company expects to use net cash in as it invests in its therapeutic discovery and development programs  intellectual property portfolio  sequencing and bioinformatics  continues to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development and new alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  makes strategic investments  and continues to make improvements in existing facilities 
the company expects  based on its current operating plans  that the cash and marketable securities balance at december  will be in the range of million to million  excluding any strategic investments 
the company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company s cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the ability of the company to attract and retain collaborators for its databases and other products and services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  expenditures in connection with its recent expansion of therapeutic discovery and development programs  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  capital expenditures required to expand and modify the company s facilities  including facilities for the company s expanding therapeutic discovery and development programs  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of the company s capital resources 
factors that may affect results risks relating to our financial results we have had only limited periods of profitability  we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not return to profitability we had net losses from inception in through and in through because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on new product and technology development  including the expansion of our internal research and development efforts for therapeutic discovery and development  the determination of the sequence of genes and the filing of patent applications regarding those gene sequences  the determination of gene functions  and the expansion of our research and development alliances 
as a result  we expect to incur losses in we expect to report net losses in future periods as well 
we expect that any profits from our information products will be more than offset by expenditures for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts 
we anticipate that these efforts will increase as we focus on the studies that are required before we can sell  or license to a third party  a drug product 
the development of therapeutic products will require significant expenses for research  development  testing and regulatory approvals 
unless we generate significant revenues to pay these costs  we will not return to profitability 
we cannot be certain whether or when we will again become profitable because of the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially successful drug products that will generate significant revenues 
our operating results are difficult to predict  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 
changes in the demand for our products  
the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may grant  
the introduction of competitive databases or services  including databases of publicly available  or public domain  genetic information  
the nature  pricing and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators  
our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic discovery and development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  
acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  including operating losses of acquired businesses  
losses and expenses related to our investments  
our ability to attract and retain key personnel  
regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  
regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  
changes in intellectual property laws that affect our rights in genetic information that we sell  
payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and 
expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights  including the lawsuits filed by invitrogen and counterclaims filed by us 
we anticipate significant fixed expenses  due in part to our expansion of our therapeutic discovery and development programs  and our continuing investment in product development and extensive support for our database collaborators 
we may be unable to adjust our expenditures if revenues in a particular period fail to meet our expectations  which would harm our operating results for that period 
forecasting operating and integration expenses for acquired businesses may be particularly difficult  especially where the acquired business focuses on technologies that do not have an established market 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price will likely fall  possibly by a significant amount 
in addition  if market or other economic conditions impact the stock market generally  or impact other companies in our industry  our stock price may also decline  possibly significantly 
if our strategic investments incur losses or charges  our earnings may decline or our losses may increase we make strategic investments in entities that complement our business 
these investments may 
often be made in securities lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions  either of which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment  
require us to record losses and expenses related to our ownership interest  
require us to record charges related to the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our investment  
require us to record acquisition related charges  such as in process research and development  
require us to record charges related to post acquisition impairment in the value of the acquired assets  such as goodwill or intangibles  and 
require us to invest greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to the management of research and development or other relationships 
the market values of many of these investments can fluctuate significantly 
we evaluate our long term equity investments for impairment of their values on a quarterly basis 
impairment could result in future charges to our earnings 
these losses and expenses may exceed the amounts that we anticipated 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies we have a diversified portfolio of investments 
our fixed rate debt investments comply with our policy of investing in only investment grade debt instruments 
the ability for the debt to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company 
should the underlying company suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
because our sales cycle is lengthy  we may spend a lot of time and money trying to obtain new or renewed subscriptions to our products but may be unsuccessful  which could hurt our profitability our ability to obtain new customers for information products to enter into license agreements for our intellectual property or to obtain renewals or additions to existing database product subscriptions depends upon prospective subscribers perceptions that our products and services can help accelerate their drug discovery efforts 
our database and licensing sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential subscribers and sell the benefits of our products to a variety of constituencies within potential subscriber companies 
in addition  each agreement involves the negotiation of unique terms  and we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that a new  renewed or expanded agreement will result 
these expenditures  without increased revenues  will negatively impact our profitability 
consolidations of pharmaceutical companies involved in drug discovery and development have affected the timing  progress and relative success of our sales efforts 
we expect that any future consolidations will have similar effects 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests as of december   we had 
total consolidated debt of approximately million  
stockholders equity of approximately million  and 
a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million for the year ended december  a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our convertible subordinated notes due that we sold in february at december   million of those notes were outstanding 
the following table shows  as of december   the aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the next five years listed aggregate year interest our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including 
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  
requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  
limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or 
placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
the capital markets may not permit us to raise additional capital at the time that we require it we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that  at some future point  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace generally  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
risks relating to our operations and industry difficulties we may encounter managing the growth of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may divert resources and limit our ability to successfully expand our operations our anticipated growth in the future of our therapeutic discovery and development programs  and our establishment of significant operations on the east coast of the united states  place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
as our operations expand  we expect that we will need to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various collaborative partners  suppliers and other third parties 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
our industry is intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our revenues may decline and our losses may increase we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and fragmented 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  human and other resources than we do 
if we cannot respond quickly to changing customer requirements  secure intellectual property positions  or adapt quickly and obtain access to new and emerging technologies  our revenues may decline and commercial opportunities for any of our drug products may be reduced or eliminated 
our competitors include 
celera genomics group of applera corporation  
curagen corporation  
gene logic inc  
human genome sciences  inc  
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and 
universities and other research institutions 
the human genome contains a finite number of genes 
our competitors may seek to identify  sequence and determine the biological function of numerous genes in order to obtain a proprietary position with respect to new genes 
in addition  we face competition from companies who are developing and may seek to develop new technologies for discovering the functions of genes  gene expression information  including microarray technologies  discovery of variations among genes and related technologies 
also  if we are unable to obtain the technology we currently use or new advanced technology on acceptable terms  but other companies are  we will be unable to compete 
we also face competition from providers of software 
a number of companies have announced their intent to develop and market software to assist pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers in managing and analyzing their own genomic data and publicly available data 
if pharmaceutical companies and researchers are able to manage their own genomic data  they may not subscribe to our databases 
extensive research efforts resulting in rapid technological progress characterize the genomics industry 
to remain competitive  we must continue to expand our databases  improve our software  and invest in new technologies 
new developments will probably continue  and discoveries by others may render our services and potential products noncompetitive 
we face significant competition for our therapeutic discovery and development efforts  and if we do not compete effectively  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may target diseases and conditions that are already subject to existing therapies or that are subject to the drug discovery efforts of other entities 
these competitors may develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our collaborators are able to do 
our competitors might develop drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that are being developed by us or that would render our products obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly 
also  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our rights 
any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with any future collaborators  might not be able to compete successfully with competitors existing and future products or obtain regulatory approval in the united states or elsewhere 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our operations and ability to support our customers could be affected  which could harm our revenues we may continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
in addition  we must continue to invest in customer support resources as the number of database collaborators and their requests for support increase 
our database collaborators typically have worldwide operations and may require support at multiple us and foreign sites 
to provide this support  we may need to open offices in additional locations  which could result in additional burdens on our systems and resources 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to achieve our objectives we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff 
our product development  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we lose the services of any of these people 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific  bioinformatics and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire  train and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing and sales staff 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
if we are unable to continue to attract  train and retain these personnel  we may be unable to expand our business 
we rely on a small number of suppliers of products we need for our business  and if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies  we will be unable to compete effectively currently  we use gene sequencing machines supplied by molecular dynamics  a subsidiary of amersham pharmacia biotech  ltd  and chemicals used in the sequencing process  called reagents  supplied by roche bioscience and amersham pharmacia biotech  ltd 
in our gene sequencing operations 
if we are not able to obtain an adequate supply of reagents or other materials at commercially reasonable rates  our ability to identify genes or genetic variations would be slower and more expensive 
if the information we obtain from third party data sources is corrupt or violates the law  our revenues and operating results could decline we rely on and include in our databases scientific and other data supplied by others  including publicly available information from sources such as the human genome project 
this data could contain errors or other defects  which could corrupt our databases 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that our data sources acquired this information in compliance with legal requirements 
if this data caused database corruption or violated legal requirements  we would be unable to sell subscriptions to our databases 
these lost sales would harm our revenue and operating results 
security risks in electronic commerce or unfavorable internet regulations may deter future use of our products  which could result in a loss of revenues we offer several products through our website on the internet and may offer additional products in the future 
our ability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet may limit online use of our products and services by our database collaborators as we may be limited by our inability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet 
advances in computer capabilities and new discoveries in the field of cryptography may comprise the security measures we use to protect our website  access to our databases  and transmissions to and from our website 
if our security measures are breached  our proprietary information or confidential information about our collaborators could be misappropriated 
also  a security breach could result in interruptions in our operations 
the security measures we adopt may not be sufficient to prevent breaches  and we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
further  if the security of our website  or the website of another company  is breached  our collaborators may no longer use the internet when the transmission of confidential information is involved 
for example  recent attacks by computer hackers on major e commerce websites and other internet service providers have heightened concerns regarding the security and reliability of the internet 
because of the growth in electronic commerce  the united states congress has held hearings on whether to further regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
the federal government could enact laws  rules and regulations that would affect our business and operations 
individual states could also enact laws regulating the use of the internet 
if enacted  these federal and state laws  rules and regulations could require us to change our online business and operations  which could limit our growth and our development of our online products 
we also rely on strategic collaborations with software providers to provide important functionality for our products 
if any of these collaborators suffer business difficulties  we may have to spend time and money to replace the functionality  and we may also be adversely affected or our customer relationships and revenues may suffer 
because our revenues are derived primarily from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  our revenues may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as to the academic community 
accordingly  our success will depend in large part upon the success of the companies within these industries and their demand for our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries or by the academic community 
these reductions and delays may result from factors such as 
changes in economic conditions  
consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  
changes in the regulatory environment  including governmental pricing controls  affecting health care and health care providers  
pricing pressures  
market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and 
other factors affecting research and development spending 
these factors are not within our control 
we are at the early stage of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts and  because we have limited experience in developing and commercializing products  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to do so we are in the early stage of building our therapeutic discovery and development operations 
our ability to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on proteins  antibodies and other compounds will depend on our ability to 
identify high quality therapeutic targets  
identify potential therapeutic candidates  
develop products internally  
complete laboratory testing and human studies  
obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  
obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals related to the efficiency and safety of our products  
enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf or develop efficient production facilities meeting all regulatory requirements  
deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions  and 
enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products 
we have limited experience with these activities and may not be successful in developing or commercializing drug products 
if we choose to outsource some of these activities  we may be unable to enter into outsourcing or licensing agreements on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if we  in the future  elect to manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities  those facilities will require substantial additional capital resources  and we will need to attract and retain qualified personnel to build or lease or operate any such facilities 
the success of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to use collaborators or other service providers to leverage our capabilities  and if we are unable to establish future collaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be delayed our strategy may depend in part upon the formation and sustainability of multiple collaborative arrangements and license agreements with third parties in the future 
we may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for licenses to technology rights 
in order for any future collaboration efforts to be successful  we must first identify potential collaborators whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours 
our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our future corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products 
we do not know whether our future collaborators  if any  might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative arrangements with us 
conflicts also might arise with future collaborative partners concerning proprietary rights to particular compounds 
we might not be able to commercialize our therapeutic product candidates successfully  and we may spend significant time and money attempting to do so at the present time  we are in the early stages of organizing our therapeutic discovery and development operations 
we have yet to identify potential therapeutic compounds and then put them into clinical testing 
of the compounds we identify as potential therapeutic candidates  at most  only a few are statistically likely to lead to successful therapeutic development efforts 
we expect that any drugs that result from our research will not be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
commercialization of any product candidates that we identify and develop depends on successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes  and we do not know whether we  or any of our future collaborators  will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential products 
it may take us or any of our future collaborators several years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trial do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretation  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of many other factors  including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
moreover  if and when our products reach clinical trials  we  or our future collaborators may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these products at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
there is also a risk that competitors and third parties may develop similar or superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products  as well as the potential risk that our products may not be accepted by the marketplace 
completion of clinical trials may take many years 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including 
our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  
variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  
difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  
unforeseen safety issues or side effects  
poor or unanticipated effectiveness of products during the clinical trials  or 
government or regulatory delays 
an important element of our business strategy is entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties under which we license our therapeutic product candidates to those third parties for development and commercialization 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators 
also  these arrangements are complex to negotiate and time consuming to document 
we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements 
the terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us 
further  any such arrangements may be unsuccessful 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating companies we acquire  and our operations and financial results could be harmed in december  we acquired proteome  inc as part of our business strategy  we may acquire other assets  technologies and businesses 
our past acquisitions have involved and our future acquisitions may involve risks such as the following 
we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  
our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  
we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting management s time and attention  
we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  
we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  
our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired  due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  
we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  
we may incur amortization or impairment expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  and 
our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses that are not located near our palo alto  california headquarters  we may experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses operations 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we could face substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
the testing and marketing of medical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
although we intend to obtain product liability insurance  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop  alone or with our future collaborators 
we  or our future collaborators  might not be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if a natural disaster occurs  we may have to cease or limit our business operations we conduct our database and a significant portion of our other activities at our facilities in palo alto  california  which is in a seismically active area 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  we do not have or plan to obtain earthquake insurance 
a major catastrophe  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
risks relating to collaborators to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional database collaborators and retain existing collaborators as of december   we had over database agreements 
if we are unable to enter into additional agreements  or if our current database collaborators choose not to renew their agreements upon expiration  we may not generate additional revenues or maintain our current revenues 
our database revenues are also affected by the extent to which existing collaborators expand their agreements with us to include our new database products and the extent to which existing collaborators reduce the number of products for which they subscribe  the impact of which will vary based upon our pricing of those products 
some of our database agreements require us to meet performance obligations  some or all of which we may not be successful in attaining 
a database collaborator can terminate its agreement before the end of its scheduled term if we breach the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a specified period 
in addition  it is likely that database revenues will decrease if we are successful in entering into co development arrangements with some of our current database subscribers to develop new therapeutic products 
licensing our gene related intellectual property may not contribute to revenues for several years  and may never result in revenues part of our strategy is to license to database collaborators and to some of our other customers our know how and patent rights associated with the genetic information in our proprietary databases  for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical  diagnostic or other products 
any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further development  clinical testing and regulatory approval before commercialization 
therefore  milestone or royalty payments from these collaborations may not contribute to revenues for several years  if at all 
if conflicts arise between our future collaborators or advisors and us  they may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our interests or to the interests of our shareholders if conflicts arise between us and our future corporate collaborators or scientific advisors  if any  the other party may act in its self interest and not in the interest of our stockholders 
it is likely that many of our future collaborators will be conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of the collaboration with us 
our future corporate collaborators  may develop  either alone or with others  products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations 
competing products  either developed by our future collaborators or to which our future collaborators have rights  may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates 
if we fail to enter into future collaborative arrangements  our business and operations would be negatively impacted we do not know if we will be able to establish collaborative arrangements  or whether any such future collaborative arrangements will ultimately be successful 
for example  there have been  and may continue to be  a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted  and may continue to result  in a reduced number of potential future corporate collaborators 
this consolidation may limit our ability to find partners who will work with us in developing and commercializing drugs 
if business combinations involving our existing corporate collaborators were to occur  the effect could be to diminish  terminate or cause delays in one or more of our corporate collaborations or agreements 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with the proceeds from future and current collaborations and agreements  will be sufficient to support our current operations 
nonetheless  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to 
any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  
the results of research and development  preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by us or our future collaborative partners or licensees  if any  
the acquisition or licensing of technologies or compounds  if any  
our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations  
our ability to manage growth  
competing technological and market developments  
the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  
the receipt of contingent licensing or milestone fees from our current or future collaborative and license arrangements  if established  and 
the timing of regulatory approvals 
risks relating to intellectual property our database revenues could decline due to sequences becoming publicly available our competitors may discover and establish patent positions with respect to the genes in our databases 
our competitors and other entities who engage in discovering may make the results of their sequencing efforts publicly available 
currently  academic institutions and other laboratories participating in the human genome project make their gene sequence information available through a number of publicly available databases  including the genbank database 
the public availability of these discoveries or resulting patent positions covering substantial portions of the human genome could reduce the potential value of our databases to our collaborators 
public availability of sequences could also impair our ability to realize royalties or other revenue from any commercialized products based on genetic information made public prior to our patent filings 
we are involved in patent litigation  which if not resolved favorably  could require us to pay damages we are currently involved in patent litigation 
in october  invitrogen corporation filed an action against us in federal court  alleging infringement of three patents that relate to the use of reverse transcriptase with no rnase h activity in preparing complimentary dna from rna 
the complaint seeks unspecified money damages and injunctive relief 
in november  we filed our answers to invitrogen s patent infringement claims  and asserted seven counterclaims against invitrogen seeking declaratory relief with respect to the patents at issue  implied license  estoppel  laches  and patent misuse 
we are also seeking our fees  costs and expenses 
in november  we filed a complaint against invitrogen in federal court alleging infringement of of our patents relating to genes  rna amplification and gene expression  and methods of fabricating microarrays of biological samples 
the complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining invitrogen from further infringement of the patents at issue  damages for invitrogen s conduct  as well as our fees  costs  and interest 
we are further seeking triple damages from the infringement claim based on invitrogen s willful infringement of our patents 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the suit and potential counterclaims brought by invitrogen vigorously 
however  our defenses may be unsuccessful 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss or damages resulting from these suits and counterclaims due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  we expect that the invitrogen litigation will result in substantial costs to us 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of this litigation or the outcome thereof may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are subject to additional litigation and infringement claims  they could be costly and disrupt our business the technology that we use to develop our products  and the technology that we incorporate in our products  may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
the risk of this occurring will tend to increase as the genomics  biotechnology and software industries expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and snps and engage in other genomic related businesses 
the success of our therapeutic discovery and development efforts will also depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
as is typical in the genomics  biotechnology and software industries  we have received  and we will probably receive in the future  notices from third parties alleging patent infringement 
except for invitrogen  no third party has a current filed patent lawsuit against us 
we may  however  be involved in future lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to 
assert claims of infringement  
enforce our patents  
protect our trade secrets or know how  or 
determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can be very costly and can divert management s efforts 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us or our future collaborators to seek licenses to other parties patents or proprietary rights 
we or our future collaborators may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling our products and services 
further  we  or our future collaborators may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary information  which may result in its unauthorized use and a loss of revenue our business and competitive position depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary database information and software technology 
despite our efforts to protect this information and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
although our database subscription agreements require our subscribers to control access to our databases  policing unauthorized use of our databases and software may be difficult 
we pursue a policy of having our employees  consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may 
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  
otherwise gain access to our proprietary information  or 
design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
if the inventions described in our patent applications on full length or partial genes are found to be unpatentable  our issued patents are not enforced or our patent applications conflict with patent applications filed by others  our revenues may decline one of our strategies is to file patent applications on what we believe to be novel full length and partial genes and snps obtained through our efforts to discover the order  or sequence  of the molecules  or bases  of genes 
we have filed us patent applications in which we claimed partial sequences of some genes 
we have also applied for patents in the us and other countries claiming full length gene sequences associated with cells and tissues involved in our gene sequencing program 
we hold a number of issued us patents on full length genes and one issued us patent claiming multiple partial gene sequences 
while the united states patent and trademark office has issued patents covering full length genes  partial gene sequences and snps  the patent and trademark office may choose to interpret new guidelines for the issuance of patents in a more restrictive manner in the future  which could affect the issuance of our pending patent applications 
we also do not know whether or how courts may enforce our issued patents  if that becomes necessary 
if a court finds these types of inventories to be unpatentable  or interprets them narrowly  the value of our patent portfolio and possibly our revenues could be diminished 
we believe that some of our patent applications claim genes and partial sequences of genes that may also be claimed in patent applications filed by others 
in some or all of these applications  a determination of priority of inventorship may need to be decided in an interference before the united states patent and trademark office  before a patent is issued 
if a full length or partial length sequence for which we seek a patent is issued to one of our competitors  we may be unable to include that full length or partial length sequence or in a library of bioreagents 
this could result in a loss of revenues 
if the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the us patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications  the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents 
the us patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection from years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the average time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications is at least one year and may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
also  we may need to refile some of our applications claiming large numbers of gene sequences and  in these situations  the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might obtain from the patents 
international patent protection is particularly uncertain  and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries  we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources biotechnology patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
regulatory risks if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to develop and market products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we might not be permitted to commercialize products from our research before commencing clinical trials in humans  we  or our future collaborators  will need to submit and receive approval from the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind 
the regulatory process also requires preclinical testing 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
any failure to obtain regulatory approval could delay or prevent us from commercializing products 
due  in part  to the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process  we cannot predict whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any product we  or our future collaborators  hope to develop 
significant research and development efforts will be necessary before any products can be commercialized 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and efficacious 
we cannot ensure that any compound developed by us  alone or with others  will prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
outside the united states  our ability  or that of our future collaborative partners  to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks associated with fda approval described above and may also include additional risks 
because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials  we may be subject to claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts 
future changes to environmental  health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations 
in addition  our future collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts 
to our knowledge  their work is performed in accordance with applicable biosafety regulations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  however  we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  these hazardous materials use by these parties 
further  we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations
