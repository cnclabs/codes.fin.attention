table of contents company growth strategy intuit has a tradition of successful customer driven innovation  using technology to address complex customer problems and develop solutions to make things easier 
by applying strategic and operational rigor to this foundation  we believe we can accelerate our customer driven innovation  and deliver stronger revenue and profit growth 
there are three key fundamentals that support our growth strategy we deliberately choose to be in businesses where we have  or we believe we can achieve  the strategic and durable advantage to produce long term profitable growth

the new products drive stronger growth and give customers a broader range of offerings to best meet their needs 
right for me product strategy we strive to deliver a range of products and services that can provide a compelling  right for me customer proposition for a wide range of customers with differing needs 
specifically  in september  we announced our right for my business strategy to better address the small business management market opportunity and to expand our target customer segment to include larger small businesses with up to employees 
our goal is to offer the right solution for each small business in our targeted markets 
we have two primary methods of providing products and services that address the varying needs of different types of small businesses solutions that are expansions of  or that integrate with  our quickbooks line of small business products  and standalone business management solutions that operate independently of our current quickbooks products 
here are the key elements of our right for my business strategy we ve been expanding our quickbooks product line to offer industry specific versions of quickbooks such as quickbooks premier accountant edition for accountants  and quickbooks point of sale products for retail businesses 
we re also offering versions of quickbooks designed for bigger  more complex businesses including quickbooks premier for small businesses needing more advanced accounting functionality  and quickbooks enterprise solutions business management software for businesses with up to employees 
we are continuously expanding the intuit developer network 
this initiative encourages third party software developers to develop applications that exchange data with quickbooks by giving them limited access to application programming interfaces for certain of our quickbooks products 
at the end of fiscal  there were about applications available for quickbooks 
these applications allow our quickbooks customers to derive even more value from their quickbooks software 
we offer business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face 
for example  we offer a broad range of payroll services and financial supplies  as well as software solutions that help businesses manage their information technology resources and assets 
we provide industry specific business management solutions to meet the specialized requirements of small businesses in selected vertical industries  including the construction industry  nonprofit 
table of contents organizations  universities and government agencies  commercial and residential property managers  and wholesale durable goods distributors 
our right for me strategy is also reshaping our tax and personal finance businesses 
in fiscal  we took the first steps in a multi year implementation of our right for me strategy in these areas  when we launched a higher end consumer tax product  turbotax premier  to address the unique needs of investors and rental property owners 
the implementation of this strategy is continuing in fiscal  starting with the august launch of quicken premier  which offers more robust investment and tax planning tools 
in september  we announced plans to provide three new versions of turbotax in fiscal turbotax retirement planning edition  turbotax investor edition  and turbotax en espa ol

our intuit payroll services complete payroll provides traditional  full service payroll processing  tax payment and check delivery services 
it encompasses our former premier payroll service  as well as cbs payroll  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the acquisition of cbs payroll significantly enhances our ability to expand and acquire customers for our full service payroll offering 
in september  we announced plans to provide integration between our complete payroll service and quickbooks  which we believe will offer a more attractive full service payroll solution for quickbooks customers 
consumer tax desktop consumer tax software 
our turbotax desktop products are designed to enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their own federal and state personal and business income tax returns easily  quickly and accurately 
our consumer tax products are designed to be easy to use  yet sophisticated enough for complicated tax returns 
we offer basic and deluxe versions of the product  and in fiscal  we introduced turbotax premier  which addresses the unique tax needs of investors and rental property owners 
our innovative instant data entry feature enables taxpayers to import data directly into their tax returns from form w s wages  form s mortgage interest and form s interest  dividends and stock transactions from more than participating financial institutions and payroll service companies 
this feature saves significant time and increases accuracy 
web based consumer tax preparation and electronic filing services 
turbotax for the web is an interactive tax preparation service that enables individual taxpayers to prepare their federal and state income tax returns entirely online 
this service allows us to reach a different segment of consumer tax customers than those who use our desktop products  a significant number of turbotax for the web customers in fiscal through fiscal had not used tax preparation software before

quicken allows customers to reconcile bank accounts  record credit card and other transactions  write checks  and track investments  mortgages and other assets and liabilities 
many customers use quicken products to manage their home based businesses 
we offer basic and deluxe versions of the product  and in august  we introduced our quicken premier product  which offers more robust investment and tax planning tools 
quicken 
com and other online services 
we provide a range of online services that help consumers manage their financial lives 
quicken 
com tm is our primary personal finance web site 
it enables customers to automate financial management tasks and make better financial decisions by giving them software tools  resources and objective information about a variety of personal finance topics  including investing  mortgages  insurance  taxes  banking and retirement  in a single online destination

com customers made available through an exclusive strategic alliance with siebert financial corp  the holding company for muriel siebert co 
inc other online services we offer include bill payment and online banking services thorough the quicken desktop product  as well as a quicken credit card

we do not currently charge customers a fee to access most features on quicken 
com  but we receive revenue from financial institutions and other companies that advertise and or sell their products or services through links from quicken 
com 
global business we have business operations in canada and japan  and we also serve markets across europe  southeast asia and other selected locations 
we have established third party relationships with local companies in certain countries to help us better address specific markets 
in all international markets except canada and europe  we focus primarily on small business products 
canada and united kingdom 
in canada  we offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken  the myob accounting product line  which we acquired during fiscal  quicktax tm consumer tax products  profile tm financial application suite professional tax products  and quicken 
ca sm  a personal finance web site with content similar to quicken 
com 
in the united kingdom  we also offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken  as well as the taxcalc tm consumer tax return product  which we acquired in fiscal japan 
the principal product we offer in japan  is yayoi  a small business accounting product that addresses the mid sized companies segment of the small business market in japan 
sales of yayoi products also generate recurring revenue from ongoing support contracts that are sold with the software 
during fiscal  we discontinued our japanese version of quickbooks 
other locations 
we offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in selected european markets through local distributors and agents 
we also offer localized versions of quickbooks and quicken products in australia  new zealand  hong kong  and singapore through a development  marketing and distribution arrangement with australia based reckon limited 

table of contents small business verticals and other as part of our right for my business strategy  we have acquired several companies that enable us to provide accounting and business management solutions to customers in selected industries  which we refer to as verticals 
these new businesses  which we report as a single business segment  include the following intuit construction business solutions formerly omware  inc  which provides business management solutions for the construction industry  intuit public sector solutions formerly american fundware  which offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations  universities and government agencies  intuit mri real estate solutions formerly management reports  inc  which provides business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers  and intuit eclipse distribution management solutions formerly eclipse  inc  which offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry 
product development historically  our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly predictable  structured development cycle of about a year  with annual releases 
for our small business desktop products  we now supplement annual releases of our core quickbooks products with ongoing releases of products that address the specialized requirements of selected vertical industries  as well as products for larger or more complex businesses 
the development cycles for our service offerings are less predictable and are generally much shorter than for our desktop products 
the development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding development cycle required to incorporate annual tax law and tax form changes each year 
for a description of other risks and challenges we face relating to our product development  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
during the past few years  we have devoted significant resources to developing new products and services  including quickbooks premier  quickbooks premier accountant edition  quickbooks enterprise solutions business management software  the intuit developer network and the instant data entry feature of our turbotax products and services 
we supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and technology from third parties  or establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our business more rapidly 
for example  during fiscal  we acquired four companies that provide small business management products in vertical industries  we worked closely with a third party technology provider to develop our quickbooks point of sale software  and we formed an exclusive strategic alliance with siebert financial corp 
to offer brokerage services to consumers 
we also devote resources to improving our existing products and services 
for our desktop software products  our recent development efforts have focused on creating an easier end to end customer experience  as well as adding new features 
we also incorporate technology in our products and services to address customer concerns about privacy and security while minimizing the impact on performance and ease of use 
in addition  we have focused in recent years on developing technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some of our tax products 
our fiscal professional tax products  as well as consumer tax products in canada  contained product activation technology that restricted sharing of the products 
in september  we announced that federal tax versions of turbotax desktop products for windows for the tax season will include product activation technology that will prevent a customer from using a single copy of turbotax to print or e file a tax return from more than one personal computer 
during the past few years  we have made a number of improvements to our product development process 
we now team technical support and product development personnel  so that we can anticipate feature usability and support issues early in the development process 
by enhancing the design process for our quickbooks products  we improved product quality and significantly lowered our customer service and technical support call volume 
we have made other changes that have allowed us to shorten the development cycle  which is enabling us to launch new products more quickly 

table of contents our research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we significantly increased research and development spending in some of our highest growth businesses small business  consumer tax and professional accounting solutions but these increases were offset by significant decreases in spending in less strategic areas and discontinued businesses 
over the next few years  we expect that our research and development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer needs in our more broadly defined market segments and adding complementary products and services to drive additional  recurring revenue from our core products  such as additional products and services for our small business customers 
we strive to maintain a balance between relatively low risk investments that address existing customer needs  and investments in more innovative but higher risk projects with potentially greater returns 
marketing  sales and distribution markets recently  we have expanded both the markets that we serve  as well as the products and services that we offer in our target markets 
historically  our target markets were individuals and small businesses with less than employees 
we continue to serve those markets with products and services such as quickbooks  turbotax and quicken 
in addition to these markets  we are now targeting small businesses with up to employees 
we are addressing this new customer segment with a number of new products and services under the umbrella of our right for my business strategy 
we are introducing industry specific solutions to meet the specialized requirements of small businesses in selected vertical industries by developing industry specific version of quickbooks  and acquiring companies that offer business management solutions to small businesses in selected vertical markets 
in addition  we recently introduced new versions of quickbooks for companies that  due to their larger size or complexity  have more demanding accounting needs 
we have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face 
we expect to continue expanding in these directions over the next several years 
see business overview right for me product strategy and products and services  above  for more details about our product and service offerings 
many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing customer demands  continuous technological changes and improvements  shifting industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors 
market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services obsolete  so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new or enhanced products and services  new business models  alternative distribution methods  different competitive strategies and other changes to the way we do business 
distribution channels over the past year we have been expanding our distribution channels to accommodate the recent expansion of both the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer 
direct sales channel 
for our core desktop software products quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  we use various direct sales campaigns  including mail and telephone solicitations  direct response newspaper and magazine advertising  and television and radio advertising  to generate software orders  stimulate retail demand and generally maintain and increase consumer awareness of our products 
direct marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to encourage existing customers to purchase additional products and services  including software upgrades 
direct sales made up a significant portion of our total desktop software revenue in fiscal  as they often generate significantly higher revenue per unit than retail sales  particularly for our small business and tax products 
many of our direct customers choose to order and or take delivery of products electronically through our web sites 
electronic ordering and delivery are generally more convenient for customers and more cost efficient for intuit 
electronic delivery has been a particularly effective method of distribution for our 
table of contents turbotax state tax preparation products and for product updates for our professional tax products 
during fiscal  products ordered and or delivered electronically accounted for a growing percentage of our direct sales revenue for our core desktop software  and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal our direct sales efforts have historically focused on generating sales of relatively inexpensive  off the shelf products to existing customers 
our service offerings  as well as our more sophisticated  higher priced software products  require a more robust approach to direct sales than desktop software 
as we have expanded our services offerings and introduced more high end software products and business management solutions over the past year  we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these new areas  as well as in our core desktop software 
we are investing in technology to consolidate and improve our management of customer contact data and order management tools across business divisions 
process excellence initiatives in fiscal have resulted in improvements in lead generation and order management  as well as more consultative selling by our customer service personnel 
in addition  we have expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its role to include more extensive and personalized contact with existing and potential customers 
in particular  some of the new products and services we now offer as a result of recent acquisitions are sold primarily through direct field sales organizations 
as a result of all of these efforts  we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue over the next few years 
retail distribution channel 
we market our quickbooks  turbotax and quicken desktop software in north america primarily through traditional retail software outlets  computer superstores  office supply superstores  warehouse clubs and general mass merchandisers 
in international markets  we also rely on distributors  value added resellers and other third parties  who sell products into the retail channel 
in fiscal we began distributing our turbotax products through safeway inc  one of the largest food and drug retailers in north america 
this enabled us to reach a significant number of new customers 
we expect to continue expanding our retail distribution locations to reach more new customers in fiscal we continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major retailers  which allows us to minimize our dependency on any specific retailer 
we are reducing our dependency on distributors as we ship more of our products directly to individual retail locations 
see manufacturing and distribution 
however  the recent slowdown in consumer demand for software has resulted in software becoming a less important category for retailers 
as a result of this trend  we have faced challenges in ensuring good product placement within retail stores 
see competition and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
we ship more products to our retailers than we expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that they will run out of products 
this is particularly true for our tax products 
as a result  we often experience significant levels of product returns from the retail channel after the end of the tax season during the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
as we execute on our right for my business strategy  we are starting to offer more complex  higher priced software products than our traditional retail software products 
it is not yet clear whether the retail channel will be an effective distribution channel for some of these higher end offerings 
oem channel 
we have existing relationships with a number of personal computer original equipment manufacturers  or oems  including dell computer corporation  apple computer inc and hewlett packard  that enable us to generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways 
first  certain oems pre bundle new user versions of certain desktop software products on the computer systems that the oems sell to their customers 
although these pre bundled oem sales sometimes generate little revenue or initial profit for intuit due to the low prices that the oems may pay for the products and slow sales in their own businesses  they are a good source of new customers and future revenues 
the second source of revenue from the oem channel is after market programs  in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products at the same time 

table of contents third party value added distribution arrangements 
as we execute on our right for my business strategy  we are supplementing our direct sales capabilities and our retail distribution relationships with selected third party distribution arrangements 
we believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our expanded and higher end product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the value added marketing and sales expertise of these third parties 
we currently have arrangements with third parties who have specialized expertise in marketing  selling and providing post sale implementation services for the vertical business management solutions offered by our construction business solutions and public sector solutions businesses  which we acquired during fiscal during fiscal and beyond  we expect to expand our network of third party relationships  to help increase revenue for some of our existing higher end product and service offerings  as well as for additional products and service we anticipate offering as we execute our right for my business strategy 
competition overview we face intense competition in almost all of our business areas  both domestically and globally 
some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced 
in addition  the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
for our turbotax  quicken and lower end quickbooks desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors are product features  ease of use  size of the installed customer base  brand name recognition  price  product and support quality and access to distribution channels 
we believe we compete effectively on most of these factors  as our three principal desktop software products are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories 
for most of our products and services other than desktop software  we believe the most important competitive factors are features and ease of use  brand name recognition  speed in getting new products and services to market  and the ability to distribute them effectively through online methods or through retailers  third party resellers and direct distribution 
for our service offerings  service reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors 
we believe we compete effectively on these factors 
our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours 
these competitors are described below 
however  for many of our products and services  the primary competitive alternatives for customers are manual tools and processes  or general purpose software 
a significant portion of our new customers are people who have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets  rather than competitors software and services  to perform financial tasks 
for example many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually  a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their book and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and manually written checks  and most of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets  manually or not at all before purchasing quicken 
small business  employer services and small business verticals competitors for our small business accounting and business management offerings include companies such as peachtree software which is owned by the sage group plc  myob group  microsoft corp 
and the american institute of certified public accountants cpabiz subsidiary 
microsoft recently acquired a provider of integrated software solutions for small and medium sized businesses  and microsoft great plains recently acquired quicksell retail point of sale applications 
another factor in the competitive environment is the increasing number of alliances between professional tax preparers and providers of small business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountant facilitated sales of small business products and services to their clients 
in addition to established competitors  other potential competitors 
table of contents have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and other products and services to small businesses 
as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings  we face additional competition from others who are already offering industry specific small business solutions  and business management tools and services for larger small businesses 
our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms companies  including new england business service and deluxe business systems  as well as with printing services offered by franchises such as kinko s and large office supply retailers such as office depot and staples 
other competitors include direct mail check printers  banks and a number of smaller scale internet based printing companies 
in addition  our quickbooks products include some features such as customizable invoicing that compete with our supplies products 
online bill payment services and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives to printed checks 
significant competitive factors for the supplies business include ordering convenience  methods of reaching customers  product quality  speed of delivery and price 
we believe our convenient access to our large quickbooks and quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for us 
our payroll services compete directly with traditional payroll service providers as well as web based service providers 
significant competitive factors include distribution channels  a highly fragmented market including financial institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll services  and offerings by non traditional competitors such as microsoft s bcentral 
we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies  including paychex and adp 
our quickbooks assisted payroll service competes directly with companies offering web based payroll services  and indirectly with companies offering other payroll solutions 
peachtree and others also offer tax table subscription services that compete directly with our quickbooks do it yourself payroll offering 
consumer tax competition in the consumer tax preparation market is intense 
our major domestic competitor for both desktop and web based consumer tax software continues to be h r block  the makers of taxcut software 
however  microsoft offered a competitive product for one season our fiscal  and new competitors may enter these markets in the future 
we also compete for customers with professional tax preparers  particularly those with franchise operations 
web based tax preparation is still a relatively new service  and we expect the competitive landscape to evolve as more competitors enter the market and others consolidate 
we also face potential competitive challenges from electronic tax preparation and filing services offered by state governments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
professional accounting solutions the professional tax preparation software marketplace has many competitors 
our largest competitors in the us are cch incorporated  with its prosystem fx product line  and ria  with its creative solutions and gosystem offerings 
in the past  the professional tax market has been highly fragmented  but it has experienced some consolidation in recent years 
personal finance in desktop personal finance software  the microsoft money product is our primary domestic competition 
we also face competition from web based personal finance tracking and management tools that are available at no cost to consumers 
there are many competitors for our other personal finance products and services 
for example  our quicken 
com site competes for traffic  and advertising and sponsorship sales  with online financial publishers  the financial areas on numerous online services such as yahoo and financially oriented web sites such as microsoft s money central 
our online brokerage offering through siebert financial corp 
competes with numerous other brokerage services 
however  we believe that the ability of quicken customers to integrate brokerage transaction data into their quicken records gives us a 
table of contents competitive advantage over other brokerage offerings 
some portals and financial institutions also provide service offerings such as web based bill presentment and payment that compete with services we offer 
we also face competition from financial institutions that offer their own financial software and web sites 
global business in canada  we face competition from a number of companies in the small business arena  including computer associates international  inc the primary competitor in canada for our consumer tax business is taxamatic  inc  the makers of taxwiz  and the primary competitor for our professional tax business is cch canadian limited 
in japan  our primary competitors in the small business accounting arena are obc  pca and sorimachi 
in europe  we face competition from the sage group plc based in the united kingdom  bhuldata wiso  microsoft and microsoft great plains in the small business market  as well as competition from web based accounting products 
our primary global competitor in the personal finance arena is microsoft 
customer service and technical support we provide customer service and technical support by telephone  online chat  fax  e mail  and our customer service and technical support web sites 
we have full time customer service and technical support staffs  which we occasionally supplement with seasonal employees and outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes  such as during the tax return filing season  or following a major product launch 
during the past few years  we have focused on developing support capabilities that can supplement  or in some situations replace  telephone service and support 
for example  customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly asked questions  check on the status of a product order and receive bug fixes electronically 
alternative service and support methods are less expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for customers as well 
we have completed a number of six sigma process excellence projects in our customer service and technical support operations to improve our call capacity forecasting  develop more flexible approaches to staffing and reduce support call volumes and handling times 
we may also consider outsourcing a greater portion of our customer service and technical support operations 
we believe these projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better service to customers at the same or lower cost 
we generally charge customers for technical support  but we do not charge for product defect issues or self help support through our technical support web sites 
support alternatives and fees vary widely by product  from self help to chat  to phone support  to onsite installation 
customers generally have a choice of different support alternatives at different prices depending on the response time they require 
despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations  we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance 
when we experience customer service and support problems  they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results 
our right for my business strategy presents additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and complexity of the products we offer 
in addition  we expect most of our growth over the next several years to come from our small business and tax products  which typically require more live technical support than personal finance products 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
manufacturing and distribution desktop software the major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating cds and floppy disks  printing boxes and related materials  and assembling and shipping the final products 
we have a manufacturing agreement with modus media international  inc under which modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail and direct launches of quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  as well as 
table of contents for day to day retail order fulfillment after product launches 
modus has operations in multiple locations to provide redundancy 
we recently entered into an agreement with sony disc manufacturing under which sony provides some of the components modus uses to manufacture our products 
we expect this arrangement will result in lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing cycle times 
we also have an in house facility that handles the manufacturing and shipping for most direct sales orders 
we have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has not been a problem for us in the past 
over the past few years we have taken steps to streamline our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs  to generate greater profitability in our core desktop software businesses 
our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the past few years 
we have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution centers with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations to a direct to storefront model in which we ship products directly to almost  individual retail locations 
this allows us to be more responsive to the needs of our retail accounts 
we have an agreement with ingram micro logistics under which ingram handles all logistics  fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales 
during the past year we have focused on better operational rigor at various points in our supply chain 
as a result  we have significantly increased our on time shipments  and significantly reduced our aggregate channel inventory levels 
we have also reduced our dependency on distributors or on any individual retail account 
one distributor  ingram micro inc  accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal no retailer accounted for or more of our total net revenue during the past three fiscal years  and no distributor met this threshold in fiscal or we believe that using these three vendors modus media  sony and ingram micro logistics to handle essentially all manufacturing and distribution  respectively  for our three primary retail product launches improves the efficiency and reliability of our product launches  and enables us to move more quickly to the direct to storefront model preferred by many of our retailers 
it also allows us to better manage inventory levels 
however  exclusive reliance on one vendor for specific functions can have severe negative consequences on our business  revenue and operating results if a vendor fails to perform for any reason 
accordingly  we continue to evaluate other vendors in order to increase efficiencies and facilitate contingency planning 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
prior to major product releases  we tend to have significant levels of backlog  but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order 
because of this fluctuation in backlog  we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future desktop software sales 
internet based products and services intuit s data centers house most of the systems  networks and databases required to operate and deliver our internet based products and services  such as turbotax for the web  electronic tax filing  quickbooks assisted payroll and quicken 
com 
through our data centers  we connect customers to products and services  and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites 
our data centers consist of approximately  servers and databases located primarily in three locations 
in an effort to reduce unavailability  or down time for our internet based products and services  we generally follow industry standard practices for creating a fault tolerant environment  but we do not have complete redundancy 
despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations  like all providers of internet based products and services  we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
privacy and security of customer information customers are concerned about the privacy and security of information they provide to product and services providers 
this concern applies to information they provide in connection with internet based products and services  as well as information they provide through more traditional channels  such as 
table of contents product registration cards 
primarily because of the financial nature of the information customers provide to us  we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security  including laws and regulations that require us to disclose certain information to customers 
we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing activities 
additional laws of this type are likely to be passed in the future  which could result in significant increased compliance costs for us 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
we have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are aware of  and can control  how we use information about them 
all publicly accessible  intuit owned and operated web sites at which customer data is collected including quicken 
com  quickbooks 
com and turbotax 
com have been certified by truste  an independent  non profit privacy organization that operates a web site certification program to alleviate users concerns about online privacy 
each of our web sites  as well as our software products  has a privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy practices  as well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their data 
to address security concerns  we use industry standard security safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us from loss  misuse and unauthorized alteration 
whenever customers transmit sensitive information  such as a credit card number or tax return data  to us through our web site  we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to us 
we work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site s servers from unauthorized access using commercially available computer security products  such as firewalls  as well as internally developed security procedures and practices 
we believe privacy and security issues pose a significant risk to intuit and other companies  especially companies doing business over the internet 
although we have made significant efforts to address customer concerns through our business practices  during the past few years we have faced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues 
our response to these allegations has been that we do not share any personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our privacy policies 
a major breach of customer privacy or security  even by another company  could have serious consequences for our businesses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results and legal proceedings 
government regulation we offer several products and services that are subject to special regulatory requirements 
for example  the brokerage related services that intuit offers through quicken brokerage powered by siebert are provided in part by an intuit subsidiary that is registered as a securities broker and is subject to certain federal and state broker dealer regulations 
in addition  some of the investment related features in our products and services are offered by an intuit subsidiary that is registered as an investment adviser with the sec and is subject to some state regulatory laws as well 
as we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings  we may become subject to additional government regulation  particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services 
we continually analyze new business opportunities  and new businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance 
current government regulation poses a number of risks to us  including potential liability to customers and or penalties and sanctions by government regulators 
future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology 
while our proprietary technology is important  we believe our success depends more heavily on 
table of contents the innovation and technical skills of our employees 
we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services  but we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and appropriate for using that technology in our current products 
we consider our principal trademarks including intuit  quickbooks  turbotax and quicken to be important assets and have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the us and many foreign countries 
the initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is years in the us most registrations can be renewed perpetually at year intervals 
we face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property  including persistent unauthorized use  and unauthorized copying or piracy  of our desktop software products 
although we have recently begun to incorporate technology in certain desktop software products to reduce unauthorized use  we expect piracy to be a persistent problem 
we also face the risk of third parties claiming that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights  and we face risks to the value of our brands when we grant trademark licenses to third parties 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks that could affect future results 
employees as of august   we had approximately  employees  located primarily in the united states  canada  japan and the united kingdom 
we believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business 
we do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees  and we believe employee relations are generally good 
although we have employment related agreements with a number of key employees  these agreements do not guarantee continued service 
we believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment 
we were selected as one of fortune magazine s best companies to work for in april however  we face intense competition for qualified employees  and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention

item legal proceedings on march   a class action lawsuit  bruce v

intuit inc  was filed on march  in the united states district court  southern district of 
table of contents new york and newby v 
intuit inc was filed on april   in the united states district court  central district of california  eastern division 
the bruce and newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit  in re intuit privacy litigation  filed on july  in the united states district court  central district of california  eastern division 
following intuit s successful motion to dismiss several of the claims  an amended complaint was filed on may  a similar lawsuit  almanza v 
intuit inc was filed on march  in the superior court of the state of california  san bernardino county  rancho cucamonga division 
an amended complaint in the almanza suit was filed on october  these purported class actions alleged violations of various federal and california statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private customer information entered at intuit s quicken 
com web site 
the complaints sought injunctive relief  orders to disgorge profits related to the alleged acts  and statutory and other damages 
in august  intuit and the plaintiffs counsel in all of the cases except rubin reached an agreement in principle to resolve the cases  subject to court approval  based on terms that are not material to intuit 
the rubin case was dismissed on november  intuit is subject to other routine legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation  that arise in the normal course of our business 
we currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability  if any  for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain  and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact 
regardless of outcome  litigation can have an adverse impact on intuit because of defense costs  diversion of management resources and other factors

our goal is to create changes so profound customers wouldn t dream of going back to their old ways of keeping their books  doing their taxes or managing their personal finances 
intuit is a leading provider of small business  tax preparation and personal finance software products and services that simplify complex financial tasks for small businesses  consumers and accounting professionals 
our principal products and services include small business accounting and business management solutions  including our quickbooks line of products and services as well as our intuit line of industry specific business management solutions  turbotax consumer tax products and services  proseries and lacerte professional tax products and services  and quicken personal finance products and services 
the business models for many of our products and services provide us with significant profit leverage  for three primary reasons 
first  these businesses have relatively high fixed costs and low variable costs  so as we increase units sold  we generate more profit per incremental unit sold 
second  as we offer products and services with greater functionality  we can increase prices to reflect the greater value that we deliver to customers 
third  as customers move to some of our higher end products and services  the better product and service mix is resulting in more revenue and profit per customer 
our tax businesses are highly seasonal 
sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending january and april we 
table of contents typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending october and july when revenue from our tax businesses are minimal  but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels 
acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets have had a significant impact on the comparability of our results year over year 
during the past three years  we have completed several acquisitions and dispositions 
in fiscal  we sold our quicken loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations 
see notes  and of the financial statements 
the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles received in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results 
during fiscal and  we recorded charges of million and million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
total goodwill amortization expense  including impairments  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal we adopted statement of financial standards sfas no 
on august  the adoption of this standard will eliminate the amortization of goodwill commencing with the first quarter of fiscal however  it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill  as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
see notes and of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income 
gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments have had a significant impact on the comparability of our yearly results as well 
all of our marketable securities and long term investments are holdings in high technology companies that have been extremely volatile since we purchased them 
in fiscal and  the market prices of a number of these companies securities declined substantially from our initial investment due to the economic downturn in the high technology industry 
during fiscal and  we recorded charges of million and million for other than temporary declines in the value of our available for sale marketable securities and other investments  and a charge of million during fiscal relating to the decline in the valuation of our trading securities 
see note of the financial statements for more information regarding our investments in marketable securities and the impact of our trading securities on our reported net income 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note of the financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
net revenue return and rebate reserves 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue based on these estimates 
product returns by distributors and retailers principally relate to the return of obsolete products 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to certain contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
for product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  trends in retailer inventory  economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products and other factors 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which are typically entered into annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional program  actual sales during the promotion  the amount of redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the economic value of the rebate 

table of contents in the past  actual returns and rebates have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
as an example  a change of in our consumer tax product return rate assumptions would have increased or reduced fiscal net revenue by approximately million 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect actual returns or rebates  then we would make a change in the reserves in the period in which the determination is made 
goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets impairment assessments 
under current accounting standards  which changed significantly at the start of fiscal  we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by these businesses 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses would result in greater impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
see note goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets and recent pronouncements  and notes and of the financial statements for more information about how we make these judgments 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income

income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish 
table of contents a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we must record a tax expense in our statement of operations 
management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax asset as of july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we cannot assure that we will not be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
if we increase the valuation allowance  it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase

our consumer tax segment had a strong year with an increase of that was driven by web based tax return preparation and electronic tax return filing services revenue  which more than doubled from fiscal the revenue growth also reflected a increase in our employer services segment 
growth in these segments was partially offset by a decline in the personal finance segment 
personal finance was adversely affected by the declining demand for internet advertising as well as by lower sales of quicken due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category 
total net revenue by business segment the following net revenue discussion is categorized by our business segments  which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results

small business small business product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products and financial supplies 
small business services revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks service solutions  our fee for support plan 
our small business verticals businesses are managed separately from the small business segment  so their revenue is included in the small business verticals and other segment below 
fiscal compared to fiscal small business total net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal total quickbooks related revenue which includes quickbooks desktop software products  quickbooks support plans  quickbooks internet gateway and quickbooks online edition was higher while quickbooks desktop product revenue alone grew 
the increase in quickbooks desktop product revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the november launch of our higher priced quickbooks premier products  as well as higher unit sales 
the volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales  which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar for customers using certain older versions of quickbooks 
we believe that the availability of a range of third party offerings from the intuit developer network to quickbooks customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales 
fiscal quickbooks related revenue growth also reflected strong results from quickbooks service solutions 
in august  we began offering several higher end support plans  which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal revenue growth in quickbooks related products and services was partially offset by a decline in quickbooks internet gateway revenue 
revenue for this business decreased due to a sharp decline in upfront fees received from internet gateway participants  as well as a decrease in transaction based fees that reflects lower customer demand for internet gateway services and fewer services being offered 
financial supplies revenue increased modestly during the year 
we expect continued growth in our small business segment in fiscal we expect quickbooks related revenue to increase due to the fiscal introduction of products with more advanced functionality such as quickbooks premier  quickbooks premier accountant edition and quickbooks enterprise solutions 
table of contents business management software  which have significantly higher selling prices than our other quickbooks products 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  total net revenue for the small business segment increased over fiscal revenue from quickbooks desktop products remained relatively flat 
while average selling prices increased for the year  unit sales declined 
this was attributable to a decline in the rate at which existing quickbooks customers upgraded to newer quickbooks products  as well as to a lower acquisition rate of new users 
product revenue from our financial supplies and services revenue from our quickbooks internet gateway and quickbooks service solutions increased in fiscal employer services employer services product revenue is derived primarily from our quickbooks do it yourself payroll formerly basic payroll offering 
employer services services revenue is derived primarily from our quickbooks assisted payroll service formerly deluxe payroll and intuit payroll services complete payroll formerly premier payroll 
fiscal compared to fiscal employer services total net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting combined growth for the quickbooks branded do it yourself payroll and assisted payroll service offerings  with revenue for the intuit payroll services complete payroll service roughly flat 
price increases accounted for a significant portion of the do it yourself payroll and assisted payroll service revenue growth  although the number of customers for the combined offerings also increased by approximately 
we expect total net revenue to continue to increase in our employer services business in fiscal  due in part to the acquisition of cbs employer services  inc  a provider of full service outsourced payroll functions for small businesses  in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal employer services total net revenue increased for fiscal compared to fiscal increases in our average selling prices for both our do it yourself payroll offering and our assisted payroll service contributed to this growth 
the higher average selling prices resulted from price increases as well as a shift toward a mix of higher priced products 
the number of customers for the combined offerings also grew approximately 
consumer tax consumer tax product revenue is derived primarily from turbotax federal and state consumer desktop tax preparation products 
consumer tax services revenue is derived primarily from turbotax for the web online tax preparation services and electronic filing services 
fiscal compared to fiscal consumer tax total net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from turbotax desktop products was up  due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of a higher priced premium product 
revenue from turbotax for the web was strong in fiscal  reflecting a significant increase in the mix of higher end service offerings turbotax premier as well as unit growth 
electronic filing units and revenue also contributed to the year over year growth 
overall  our consumer tax customer base grew in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  consumer tax total net revenue increased approximately compared to fiscal the increase was due to a combination of higher average selling prices resulting from price increases as well as improved product mix and increased unit sales for both our desktop products and web based tax preparation services 
our consumer tax business also benefited from microsoft s discontinuation of its desktop consumer tax preparation software after the tax season which ended april  our web based tax preparation and electronic filing services also experienced strong growth during fiscal web based tax preparation revenue more than doubled from fiscal as a result of increased prices as well as a increase in unit volume 
in addition  our 
table of contents electronic filing services revenue increased 
overall  our consumer tax customer base grew in fiscal we expect continued growth in our consumer tax business in fiscal due to the continuing upward trend in consumer use of the web for tax return preparation and filing 
we also expect revenue growth as a result of product activation features to be included in the tax year federal versions of turbotax desktop products for windows  which are designed to reduce unauthorized sharing of those products 
professional accounting solutions professional accounting solutions product revenue is derived primarily from proseries and lacerte professional tax preparation products 
professional accounting solutions services revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and tax advice services 
fiscal compared to fiscal total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately million or of the growth compared to fiscal resulted from our acquisition of tax and accounting software corporation in april higher revenue from electronic filing services was also a significant factor in the increase 
our fiscal introduction of product activation technology that restricted sharing of professional tax products and higher average selling prices for our proseries and lacerte unlimited use products also contributed to the revenue growth 
renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth resulted from higher average selling prices for both our proseries and lacerte unlimited use products and unit growth for our pay per return customers 
renewal rates for our existing customer base were strong during fiscal we expect continued growth in our professional accounting solutions business in fiscal but we expect the rate of growth to slow compared to fiscal fiscal growth rates for this business were unusually high due to the acquisition of taasc in late fiscal personal finance personal finance product revenue is derived primarily from quicken desktop products 
personal finance services revenue is minimal 
other revenue consists of quicken 
com advertising revenue and royalties for online transactions 
fiscal compared to fiscal personal finance total net revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decline in revenue from quicken desktop products and a decline in quicken 
com revenue 
solid growth in our online transactions business partially offset these declines 
the decrease in quicken revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category 
our share of retail units in this category remained above in fiscal the decrease in quicken 
com advertising revenue reflected the industry wide decline in spending by purchasers of internet advertising 
we expect these trends to continue in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total net revenue from the personal finance segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline in revenue was attributable in part to a decline in unit sales for our quicken desktop products and a decline in our quicken 
com internet advertising revenues 
quicken revenue was down due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category 
advertising revenue declined compared to the prior year due to the overall economic environment which resulted in reduced advertising spending by purchasers of internet advertising 
we experienced continued growth in our online transactions business  which partially offset these declines 

table of contents global business global business product revenue is derived primarily from quickbooks  quicken and quicktax desktop software products in canada and yayoi small business desktop accounting products in japan 
global business services revenue primarily consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with yayoi software in japan 
fiscal compared to fiscal global business total net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from canada increased year over year 
this reflected strong tax season results for quicktax  due in part to the preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop software 
canadian tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest revenue declines for quickbooks and quicken 
revenue in japan declined compared to fiscal japan s product revenue decreased  due primarily to our discontinuation of the quickbooks product line in japan in the second quarter of fiscal revenue from yayoi products was roughly flat compared to fiscal the overall decline in japan s product revenue was partially offset by increased revenue from yayoi support contracts 
fiscal compared to fiscal global division total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to overall revenue growth in canada  which was driven by growth in quickbooks revenue 
in addition  canada experienced growth in professional tax revenue as a result of an acquisition we made early in fiscal revenue in japan increased due to higher retail sales of our yayoi small business accounting software 
this was partially offset by declining sales of quickbooks in japan as well as decreased royalties and an adverse foreign exchange rate impact that resulted in lower average selling prices in us dollars 
small business verticals and other as part of our right for my business strategy  in fiscal we acquired several companies that enable us to provide accounting and business management solutions to customers in selected industries  which we refer to as verticals 
these new businesses  which we report as a single business segment  include the following intuit construction business solutions formerly omware  inc  which provides business management software for the construction industry  intuit public sector solutions formerly the flagship group  which offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations  universities  and government agencies  intuit mri real estate solutions formerly management reports  inc  which provides business management software for commercial and residential property managers  and intuit eclipse distribution management solutions formerly eclipse  inc  which offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry 
three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  total net revenue from the small business vertical and other segment was not significant in fiscal and consisted primarily of revenue generated by omware  inc there was no significant revenue in this segment from sources other than the acquired vertical businesses during fiscal driving the growth of the vertical businesses we have acquired so far  and acquiring additional vertical businesses  are key business initiatives for fiscal therefore  we expect that we will continue to report these businesses as a separate business segment in the future

fiscal compared to fiscal cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal we lowered our per unit materials  manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink wrap software products  resulting in significant cost savings 
these savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our product distribution function 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we established a new third party retail distribution relationship for our shrink wrap software products 
this distribution relationship enables us to ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores and allows us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely basis 
by providing better service to our retailers  we are reducing product returns and related costs 
because of this and because we plan to continue redesigning the packaging for many of our software products and further streamlining our manufacturing processes  we expect cost of products as a percentage of product revenue to decline in fiscal cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and web based tax businesses  which experienced significant revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases 
cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased data center costs related to our personal finance segment s online transaction business  which experienced revenue growth in fiscal amortization of purchased software decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal this reflected lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized 
this decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  which caused the decrease in the base of assets 
see note of the financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses for all of our product lines due to improved inventory management

we also implemented a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels 
however  these benefits were more than offset by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the customers of tax accounting and software company  a company that we acquired in april  to our proseries and lacerte professional tax products  and by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing customer base 
we expect customer service and technical support expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal as taasc conversion costs gradually decline and as we continue to benefit from lower cost  more scalable electronic customer service and technical support delivery mechanisms 
fiscal compared to fiscal customer service and technical support expenses were flat at of total net revenue in fiscal and this reflected the benefit of providing an increased proportion of customer service and technical support more efficiently and less expensively through web sites and other electronic means  and from the expansion of quickbooks service solutions  our fee for support program for quickbooks customers 
these improvements were offset by the april start of support costs to convert customers of our newly acquired taasc business to our proseries and lacerte professional tax products 
selling and marketing fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses were of total net revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs to support the right for my business strategy announced in september we also incurred incremental marketing expenses for our construction business solutions products  which we acquired in november these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment 
we also donated million to the intuit foundation in fiscal  which will be used to benefit the community through contributions to selected non profit

we also benefited from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality for our new quickbooks products 
the net result was that research and development expenses in fiscal were flat in absolute dollars and declined as a percentage of total net revenue to of total net revenue  compared to in fiscal during fiscal  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development  particularly for new small business products and services

general and administrative fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses were of total net revenue in fiscal and fiscal we experienced increased directors and officers liability insurance costs and costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of omware  inc in november and employeematters  inc in december these increases were offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal we had relatively high accounts receivable write offs in fiscal due to the deteriorating financial condition of many internet companies with whom we did business 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal due to the costs of integrating our fourth quarter fiscal acquisitions and other acquisitions we expect to make in fiscal  as well as to investments in our internal audit function and process excellence infrastructure 
we also expect bad debt expense for fiscal to be somewhat higher than for fiscal because we experienced unusually low levels of bad debt expense in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses were of total net revenue for fiscal  compared to of total net revenue for fiscal during fiscal  we experienced an increase in our bad debt expense related to the economic downturn in the high technology industry that impacted many companies with whom we did business

table of contents charge for purchased research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of third party appraisers  we determine the value of in process projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established 
the value of the projects is determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into commercially feasible products  estimating the net cash flows we believe would result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value 
the resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for purchased research and development as a result of our acquisition of management reports  inc now intuit mri real estate solutions 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for purchased research and development when we acquired tax accounting and software corporation 
we recorded million for purchased research and development as a result of our boston light software corporation and hutchison avenue software corporation acquisitions in fiscal although we intend to continue to acquire relatively mature businesses with products whose technological feasibility has been demonstrated as part of our right for my business strategy  it is possible that we will incur additional charges for purchased research and development in the future 
charge for vacant facilities during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in mountain view  california and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space

see note of the financial statements 
acquisition related charges acquisition related charges include the amortization of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions  and impairment charges relating to certain acquired assets 
see note of the financial statements 
the fasb recently adopted a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination 
it continues to require us to recognize goodwill as an asset whenever we pay more for a business than the total of its net tangible and intangible assets  but it does not permit us to amortize goodwill  which we were previously required to do 
under the new statement  we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fair value based approach on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs indicating potential impairment 
the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after june  the additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired after june  would have been approximately million in fiscal had this new standard not been in place 
we will adopt the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal and will therefore cease goodwill amortization for acquisitions we made prior to july  however  it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
in addition  we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate

non operating income and expenses interest and other income in fiscal  interest and other income decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease during fiscal was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and short term investment balances in fiscal  reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates during the period 
the increase during fiscal resulted from higher average cash and short term investment balances  due in part to sales of marketable securities as well as more cash generated from operations compared to fiscal the total fiscal increase was partially offset by the effect of lower market interest rates compared to fiscal interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our payroll business  and is not included in interest and other income

as of july   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards 
the allowance reflects management s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions 
while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient  it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets

in may  intuit s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common stock over a three year period 
in july  our board of directors increased the authorized purchase amount by million 
the stock repurchase program is intended to help offset some of the dilution resulting from the issuance of shares under intuit s employee stock plans 
at july   we had repurchased a total of million of common stock since the inception of the program 

table of contents in connection with the sale of our quicken loans mortgage business in july  we have agreed to continue providing to the purchasing company an interest bearing line of credit of up to million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months 
the line expires on january  the line is secured by the related mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of million at july  see note of the financial statements 
loans to executive officers and other employees totaled million at july  and million at july  loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans and none of these were made or modified since july  loans are generally interest bearing  secured by real property and have maturity dates of up to years 
see note of the financial statements 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july  payments due by period in millions less than after contractual obligations year years years years total restricted cash short term notes payable long term debt operating leases other obligations total contractual cash obligations restricted cash july  included million that we held in escrow in connection with our fiscal acquisition of cbs employer services  inc the escrow period expires in june restricted cash also included million for rebates due our customers 
other obligations at july  consisted primarily of amounts we owe to former stockholders of cbs employer services  inc in connection with intuit s acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal this contractual obligation is included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet 
see notes and of the financial statements 
recent pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  in applying the purchase method  sfas changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights  or whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
if neither criteria is met  the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized 
we have applied the requirements of sfas to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized 
however  these assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
the shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all 
table of contents acquisitions completed after june  the additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired subsequent to june  would have been approximately million in fiscal had this new standard not been in place 
total goodwill amortization expense  including impairments  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal we adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to july  however  it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions 
in addition  we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under sfas  we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of august   the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption of sfas on august   we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately million  excluding the balance of approximately million for assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill 
as of that date  we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill 
these balances will be subject to the transitional provisions of sfas and transitional impairment losses that may be required to be recognized upon adoption of sfas and are indeterminable at this time 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supersedes fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets we expect to dispose of and significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
this classification is important because held for sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount 
sfas also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are actually incurred  rather than when the amount of the loss is estimated  as presently required 
we adopted sfas effective august  and do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force released issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  which applies to annual or interim financial statement periods beginning after december  the release provides that cash consideration including sales incentives that we give to our customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate 
we adopted this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not reclassify prior period financial statements 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
a formal commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one time charge for most exit and disposal costs 
instead  companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue no 
are not affected 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents risks that could affect future results company wide factors that could affect future results our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal 
seasonality and other factors cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and net income 
several of our businesses are highly seasonal particularly our tax businesses  but also small business and personal finance to a lesser extent 
this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results 
revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending january and april we experience lower revenues  and often significant operating losses  in the first and fourth quarters ending october and july our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors  including changes in product release dates  and the timing of acquisitions  dispositions  goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges and gains and losses related to marketable securities 
fluctuations in interest rates can cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our net income  earnings per share and asset values 
recent declines in interest rates have resulted in a significant decline in the interest income we earned on our investment portfolio during recent reporting periods  which has had a negative impact on our net income loss and net income loss per share 
declining interest rates can also reduce the value of our interest rate sensitive assets  such as certain assets that relate to our payroll business 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more details 
our recent acquisitions have presented business integration challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these acquisitions 
during the past few years  we have completed numerous acquisitions  including five during fiscal these acquisitions have expanded our product and service offerings  personnel and geographic locations 
integrating and organizing acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational  financial and management information systems  as well as for our product development processes 
we might not be able to coordinate the diverse operating structures  policies and practices of companies we have acquired or successfully integrate the employees of the acquired companies into our organization and culture  which could harm employee morale and productivity 
these difficulties may be increased by the various geographic locations of our acquired businesses  which include colorado  connecticut  ohio and texas 
if we do not adequately address issues presented by growth through acquisitions  we may not fully realize the intended benefits including financial benefits of these acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions  which could put a strain on our resources and adversely affect our financial results 
a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings  and we expect that a significant portion of this expansion will result from acquisitions 
integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our business could put a strain on our resources and be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  we may not succeed in integrating acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated financial benefits 
our acquisition strategy and future acquisitions could also result in the following risks increased competition for acquisition opportunities could inhibit our ability to complete suitable acquisitions  and could also increase the price we would have to pay to complete acquisitions 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions successfully  we may not be able to develop and market products for new industries or applications with which we may not be familiar 
despite our due diligence reviews  acquired businesses may bring with them unanticipated liabilities  business or legal risks or operating costs that could harm our results of operations or business  reduce or eliminate any benefits of the acquisition or require unanticipated expenses 
if we fail to retain the services of key employees of acquired companies for significant time periods after the acquisition of their companies  we may experience difficulty in managing the acquired company s business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

table of contents the accounting treatment of acquisitions can result in significant acquisition related accounting charges and expenses that would reduce our reported results of operations both at the time of the acquisition and in future periods 
future acquisitions may require us to issue shares of our stock and stock options to owners of the acquired businesses  which would result in dilution to the equity interests of our stockholders 
acquisition related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income 
our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses  including amortization of purchased software which is reflected in cost of revenue  as well as charges for in process research and development  and amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased intangibles and deferred compensation which are reflected in operating expenses 
total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were million in fiscal  million in fiscal including charges of million to write down the long lived intangible assets related to three acquisitions  and million in fiscal including charges of million to write down the long lived intangible assets related to two acquisitions 
additional acquisitions  and any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets  could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
recent changes to financial accounting standards board guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
the new fasb standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination applies to all acquisitions initiated after june  in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the new standard for acquisitions we completed before june  under the new standard  we must continue to recognize goodwill as an asset but will not amortize goodwill as previously required 
instead  we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually and also when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
as a result of this shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach  we will stop recording charges for goodwill amortization 
however  it is possible that in the future  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as we continue to expand our business 
as of august   we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million  which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill 
these amounts could be subject to impairment charges in the future 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
there has been increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense 
note of the financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net income and earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three fiscal years and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in note a general decline in economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our products and services 
the continuing downturn in general economic conditions has led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including software and other technology products 
we believe the economic decline was partially responsible for slower than expected growth in our small business segment during fiscal and the first half of fiscal although we experienced solid revenue growth in most of our businesses during the second half of fiscal  the future economic environment remains uncertain 
if conditions decline  or fail to improve  in geographic areas that are significant to us  such as the united states  canada and japan  we could see a significant decrease in the overall demand for our products and services that could harm our operating results 
if we do not continue to successfully develop new products and services in a timely manner  our future financial results will suffer 
we believe that it is necessary to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services to remain competitive in the markets we serve 

table of contents failure to do so may give competitors opportunities to improve their competitive position at our expense and result in declines in our revenue and earnings 
however  developing and improving our products and services is a complex process involving several risks 
hiring and retaining highly qualified technical employees is critical to the success of our development efforts  and we face intense competition for these employees 
launches of products and services can be delayed for a variety of reasons 
new or improved products and services may also have defects that hinder performance 
third party products we incorporate in  or use to build and support  our products and services may also contain defects that impair performance 
these problems can be expensive to fix and can also result in higher technical support costs and lost customers 
new products or features are sometimes built on top of older architectures or infrastructures  which can take longer to bring to market  make quality assurance and support more difficult  and lead to complexity in supporting future functionality 
the expansion of our product and service offerings through internal growth and through recent and anticipated acquisitions creates risks due to the number and complexity of our revenue models and the operational infrastructure required to support our expanded portfolio of products and services 
the business models for our expanding range of products and services rely on more complex and varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses 
in particular  the revenue recognition practices of several of the businesses we have recently acquired are more complex than the revenue recognition principles that apply to our existing products and services 
we expect this trend to continue with future acquisitions 
as a result of both acquisitions and internal growth  we expect to continue expanding our product offerings to larger enterprises  and we may begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element sales arrangements 
these dynamics may require us to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for current products  which would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped  but result in more revenue in fiscal periods after shipment 
in addition  many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses  and we must continually develop  expand and modify our internal systems and procedures including call center  customer management  order management  billing and other systems to support these businesses 
in particular  the success of our internet based services requires us to maintain continuous and reliable operations at our data center 
despite our efforts  like all providers of internet based products and services  we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 
lengthy and or frequent service outages particularly for services that customers consider time sensitive can result in negative publicity  damage to our reputation and lost customers 
despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations  we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance 
we occasionally experience customer service and support problems  including longer than expected hold times when our staffing is inadequate to handle higher than anticipated call volume  and a large number of inquiries from customers checking on the status of product orders when the timing of shipments fails to meet customer expectations 
this can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial performance 
in order to improve our customer service and technical support  we must continue to focus on eliminating underlying causes of service and support calls through product improvements and better order fulfillment processes  and on more accurately anticipating demand for customer service and technical support 
we face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation  which could hinder the growth of our businesses 
despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security  these issues still pose a significant risk  and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues 
for example  during fiscal and fiscal  there were press articles criticizing our privacy and security practices as they relate to the connectivity of our desktop software to our web sites 
we have faced lawsuits and negative press alleging that we improperly shared information about customers with third party ad servers for our web sites 
a major breach of customer privacy or security by intuit  or even by another company  could have serious consequences for our businesses  including reduced customer interest and or additional regulation by federal or state agencies 
in addition  the federal government has developed mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols  and we have incurred significant expenses to comply with these requirements 
additional similar federal and state laws  and or 
table of contents laws that govern telemarketing activity  may be passed in the future  and the cost of complying with additional legislation could have a negative impact on our operating results 
if internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns  increasing regulation or for other reasons  the growth of our internet based businesses would be hindered 
we face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel 
we face ongoing challenges in negotiating favorable terms including financial terms with retailers  due in part to the recent trend of declining importance of software as a retail category 
in addition  any termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our net revenue 
also  any financial difficulties of our resellers could have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established 
we rely on third party vendors to handle substantially all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail desktop software products 
to manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch  we have manufacturing relationships with modus media and sony  and a distribution arrangement with ingram micro logistics 
while we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities  relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason  including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor 
actual product returns may exceed returns reserves  particularly for our consumer tax preparation software 
we ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell  in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products 
this is particularly true for our consumer tax products  which have a short selling season 
like most software companies  we have a liberal product return policy and we have historically accepted significant product returns 
we establish reserves for product returns in our financial statements  based on estimated future returns of products 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies net revenue return and rebate reserves 
we closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns 
in the past  returns have not generally exceeded these reserves 
however  if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves  it would result in lower net revenue 
we face existing and potential government regulation in many of our businesses  which can increase our costs and hinder the growth of our businesses 
we offer some regulated products and services through separate subsidiary corporations 
establishing and maintaining regulated subsidiaries can requires significant financial  legal and management resources 
if any regulated subsidiary fails to comply with applicable regulations  it could face liability to customers and or penalties and sanctions by government regulators 
in addition  our internet based products and services are available in many states and foreign countries 
as a result  we may be subject to regulation and or taxation in many additional jurisdictions  which could substantially slow commercial use of the internet and growth of our internet based businesses 
gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments can cause significant fluctuations in our net income 
our investment activities have had a significant impact on our net income 
we recorded pre tax net gains from marketable securities and other investments of million in fiscal and pre tax net losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of july   our marketable securities balance was million 
any additional significant long term declines in value of these securities could reduce our net income in future periods 
legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology 
current us laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software pirates  and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection 
policing unauthorized use of 
table of contents our products is difficult  expensive and time consuming 
although we have begun to incorporate product activation technology in some of our tax preparation products in order to reduce unauthorized sharing of the products  we expect that software piracy will continue to be a persistent problem for our desktop software products 
in addition  the internet may tend to increase  and provide new methods for  illegal copying of the technology used in our desktop and internet based products and services 
we also face risks relating to our licensing of our intellectual property to third parties 
in connection with our sale of our quicken loans mortgage business  we licensed the use of the quicken loans and quicken mortgage trademarks to the purchaser 
if the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license  it could result in serious and irreparable harm to intuit s reputation and the value of its quicken related brands 
we do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services 
we have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology that we do not own in our current products and services 
from time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties to include their technology in our existing products  in new versions of our current products or in new products 
we may not be able to renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms  or at all 
we may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations 
as the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand  we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties 
although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products and services do not violate the intellectual property rights of others  it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant s intellectual property rights 
occasionally these communications result in lawsuits 
in many of these cases  it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property that is being asserted is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure 
past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation  settlement or licensing expenses  but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude 
existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all  or redesign our software products or services  possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal 
any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results 
our ability to conduct business could be impacted by a variety of factors  such as electrical power interruptions  earthquakes  fires  terrorist activities and other similar events 
our business operations depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large number of computer and communications hardware and software systems 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from electrical power interruptions  telecommunication failures  earthquakes  fires  floods  terrorist activities and their aftermath  and other similar events 
other unpredictable events could also impact our ability to continue our business operations 
for our internet based services  system failures of our internal server operations or those of various third party service providers could result in interruption in our services to our customers 
any significant interruptions in our ability to conduct our business operations could reduce our revenue and operating income 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the impact of interruptions to our business operations 
factors relating to competition we face competitive pressures in all of our businesses  which can have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market position 
there are formidable current and potential competitors  including competition from publicly funded state government entities in the consumer tax area 
accordingly  we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
in all our businesses  we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services  reduce prices  gain better access to distribution channels  increase advertising including advertising targeted at intuit customers  
table of contents and release new products and services before we do 
any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could result in lower net revenue and or lower profitability for intuit 
they could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers 
in the small business and employer services areas  we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results 
our small business products and services face current competition from competitors desktop software  as well as from other web based small business services products 
microsoft offers several products and services targeted at similar size customers as our high end quickbooks products  and has recently acquired additional products and services that compete with our small business offerings 
other competitors and potential competitors have begun providing  or have expressed significant interest in providing  accounting and business management products and services to small businesses 
as we implement our right for my business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced 
for example  we face direct competition in our intuit payroll services complete payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies  including paychex and adp 
our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors 
we face intense competitive pressures in our consumer tax preparation software business  which can have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market position 
there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector 
we also face competition from publicly funded state government entities that offer individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and filing services  at no cost to individual taxpayers 
if state governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services  it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results in future years 
the federal government announced a proposal in august that would mitigate the risk of government encroachment in federal tax preparation and filing services 
the policy proposes that  for at least the next three years  a number of private sector companies  rather than the federal government  would provide web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to lower income taxpayers and other underserved taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as our intuit tax freedom project 
despite this positive development  future administrative  regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely impact intuit and other companies that provide tax preparation software and services 
intuit is actively working with others in the private sector  as well as with state government policy makers  to help clarify the appropriate roles for government agencies and the private sector in the electronic commerce marketplace 
our personal finance products face aggressive competition that could have a negative impact on revenue  profitability and market position 
our quicken products compete directly with microsoft money  which is aggressively promoted and priced 
we expect competitive pressures for quicken to continue  both from microsoft money and from web based personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers 
competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our quicken product line 
there are many competitors for our internet based personal finance products and services 
however  the general downturn in internet and technology stocks since march has resulted in significant consolidation  with fewer  but more financially sound  competitors surviving 
this could make it more difficult for us to compete effectively 
specific factors affecting small business it is too early to provide any assurance that our right for my business strategy will generate substantial and sustained revenue growth in the small business accounting and business management segments 
a key component of our right for my business strategy is to continue to expand our small business accounting and management products and services  through internal growth and from acquisitions 
we don t expect that sales of our quickbooks desktop products alone will be adequate to meet our growth goals 
we must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments as well as from 
table of contents new products and services 
there are a number of risks associated with the strategy  including the following our strategy depends on our successfully completing acquisitions and integrating acquired companies  which presents a number of challenges as described above under company wide factors that could affect future results 
our strategy is resulting in a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer 
this is placing greater demands on our research and development  marketing and sales resources  as we must develop  market and sell both the new products and services as well as periodic enhancements to an expanding portfolio of products and services 
this will also require us to continually develop  expand and modify our internal business operations systems and procedures to support new businesses  including our customer service and technical support call centers  and our customer management  order management  billing and other systems 
many of the new products and services we are and will be offering are much more complex than our traditional core desktop software products and are being priced accordingly 
they will therefore require a more consultative sales process  and a higher level of post sales support 
if we are not able to effectively adapt our marketing  sales  distribution and customer support functions to accommodate these changes  we will not succeed in generating significant or sustained revenue from these new businesses 
our financial supplies business relies on two key single source vendors 
we have an exclusive contract with john h 
harland company to print and fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business 
harland fulfilled orders for about to of our supplies revenue in fiscal and  and about of our supplies revenue in fiscal we believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business 
however  if there are significant problems with harland s performance  it could have a material negative impact on sales of supplies and on intuit s business as a whole 
we also have a sole source vendor that operates our supplies sales website 
if there are any significant problems with this vendor s performance  it could have a negative impact on supplies revenue 
specific factors affecting employer services our employer services business faces a number of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and profitability 
for our employer services  we must be able to process customer data accurately  reliably and in a timely manner in order to attract and retain customers and avoid the costs associated with errors 
for example  if we make errors in providing accurate and timely payroll information  cash deposits or tax return filings  we face potential liability to customers  additional expense to correct product errors and loss of customers 
for our internet based offerings including quickbooks do it yourself payroll and quickbooks assisted payroll  we must also continue to improve our operations to provide reliable connectivity to our data centers to enable customers to transmit and receive data 
in order to generate sustained growth for our intuit payroll services complete payroll  we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and proactive direct field sales operation  which is a different distribution method than those we have historically relied on 
for future employer services we face the risk of potential delays in technology development  as well as dependency on the performance of third parties that may be key to our ability to deliver certain services 
we also face the risk that we may not be able to successfully cross sell employee administration products and services to the existing base of quickbooks customers 
specific factors affecting our tax businesses we face intense competitive pressures in our consumer tax preparation software business  which can have a negative impact on our revenue  profitability and market position 
there are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector 
we also face competition from publicly funded state government entities if state governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to develop 
table of contents consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services  it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results in future years 
we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal and beyond 
if we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings  we could lose revenue and customers 
our web based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season 
we face significant challenges in maintaining high service levels  particularly during peak volume service times 
for example  we experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and or tax preparation services during fiscal and  and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on april  we do not believe any prior service outages had a material financial impact  prevented a significant number of customers from completing and filing their returns in a timely manner  or posed a risk that customer data would be lost or corrupted 
however  we did experience negative publicity in some instances 
the exact level of demand for quicken turbotax for the web and electronic filing is impossible to predict 
if we are unable to meet customer expectations in a cost effective manner  we could lose customers  receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs  any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses 
significant problems or delays in the development of our tax products would result in lost revenue and customers 
the development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year 
the rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in the products and the risk of launch delays 
any major defects could lead to negative publicity  customer dissatisfaction and incremental operating expenses including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our products 
a late product launch could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor s product for that year s tax season or to choose not to purchase tax preparation software 
this would result in lost revenue in the current year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our products to those customers in future tax seasons 
specific factors affecting personal finance the long term viability of personal finance business will depend on our ability to provide new products and services that attract customers and that can generate revenue sources other than just advertising revenue 
the demand for personal finance software such as quicken has been weakening over recent years  and the demand for internet advertising on web sites like quicken 
com has declined precipitously 
we must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue to provide sustainable future growth for our personal finance business 
in an effort to stimulate customer demand and generate revenue growth  we recently launched quicken brokerage powered by siebert  an online and telephone based securities brokerage service for quicken and quicken 
com customers made available through an exclusive strategic alliance with siebert financial corp  the holding company for muriel siebert co 
inc 
however  it is too early to tell whether this service will generate sustainable revenue growth 
furthermore  it is unlikely that the brokerage service  even if successful  will by itself be sufficient to sustain our personal finance business  so we must identify additional sources for growth 
specific factors affecting our global business business conditions in international markets and other risks inherent in global operations may negatively impact our financial performance 
conducting business globally involves many risks  including potential volatility in the political and economic conditions of certain foreign countries  difficulties in managing operations in different locations including hiring and retaining management personnel  a product development process that is often more time consuming and costly than in the united states due in part to localization requirements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and unanticipated changes in foreign regulatory requirements 
in particular  the economic situation in japan had a negative impact on global revenue and profits during recent fiscal years 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy dictates that  for short term investments  we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments with any individual issuer in a managed portfolio to a maximum of million 
the following table of our short term investments portfolio is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security principal amounts by stated maturity years ending july  in thousands  except interest rates fair value and july  thereafter total cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate total portfolio average interest rate marketable securities we carried balances in marketable equity securities as of july  that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we considered all of our marketable securities held at that date to be available for sale 
if our available for sale securities experience further declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary  we will reflect the additional loss in our net income loss in the period when the subsequent impairment becomes apparent 
see note of the financial statements for more information regarding our investments in marketable securities and the impact our trading securities had on our reported net income loss in prior periods 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents a component of market risk to us because significant declines in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in our net income loss and net income loss per share and in the value of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments  particularly those that relate to our payroll business 
interest rate movements affect the interest income earned on investments we hold in our short term investment portfolio and the value of those investments 
over the past few years  we have experienced significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in interest rates 
a significant decrease in future interest rates will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments held at july  impact of foreign currency rate changes we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars  japanese yen  and british pounds into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results  though the historical impact has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
currency 
table of contents exchange risk is also minimized since foreign debt is due exclusively in local foreign currencies 
for each of the three years presented there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
