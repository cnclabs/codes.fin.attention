sales and marketing sales 
to date  we have sold products primarily through our direct sales and services organizations located in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  japan  singapore  china and australia 
in addition  we have sold products worldwide through vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors 
we intend to grow our direct sales organization to intensify coverage of large organizations and to augment telesales operation to cover smaller organizations 
in addition  we will continue to both leverage and grow our existing network of vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors to expand our indirect distribution channel worldwide 
we expect to fund such expansion out of working capital 
our agreements with our vars and plps generally provide for the right to resell a standard or customized version of our products in conjunction with sales of the vars and plps products or services 
we typically offer our vars a purchase discount to incent the vars to sell our products 
in addition these third parties perform some or all of the following functions sales and marketing  systems implementation and integration  software development and customization  and ongoing consulting  training  service and technical support 
we generally offer such parties discounts on products and training  as well as a cooperative marketing program and field level assistance from our direct and channel sales forces 
we will continue to leverage sales and marketing through indirect channel partners that will distribute or resell our products in their respective markets 
total revenues from vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors accounted for approximately  and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
our agreements with our distributors generally require that such distributors make certain minimum purchases of brio s products  none of which minimum purchases are material in amount either individually or in the aggregate 
we do not typically grant exclusive sales territories to our distributors 
marketing 
we are focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our products  as well as developing strategic partnerships 
we have a marketing strategy with several key components image and awareness building  direct marketing to both prospective and existing customers  strong web presence and broad scale marketing programs in conjunction with key local and global partners 
our corporate marketing strategy includes public relations activities  a conference and trade show speakers program  as well as programs to work closely with analysts and other third parties 
our direct marketing activities include participation in selected trade shows and conferences  targeted advertising  as well as ongoing direct mail efforts to existing and prospective customers 
we have used local  regional and web based seminars to assist prospects in selecting our solutions 
we have used the web to further interest in our products and services and help with the lead generation process for our sales organization 
our marketing strategy also includes programs that focus on technology partners  consultants  vars  resellers  system integrators and distributors 
the marketing organization also provides a wide range of programs  materials and events to support the sales organization in its efforts 
our sales and marketing organization consisted of full time employees as of march  the sales and marketing staff is based at our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
we also have field sales offices in the metropolitan areas of chicago  new york  san francisco  columbus  seattle  boston  denver  irvine  atlanta  washington dc and dallas as well as international sales offices in canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  japan  singapore  hong kong and australia 
research and development we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and improve current products and to develop new products that meet analytic needs 
we have invested heavily in our internal research and development teams to support current and future product development 
as of march   our research and development organization consisted of full time employees 
product requirements are based on customer feedback  technical support experience  market analysis and technology trends 
we employ a professional development methodology that monitors customer satisfaction  quality  cost and delivery schedules 
customer support our customer support is a necessary component to the successful marketing and sale of our products 
maintenance and support contracts  which are typically for twelve months and sold with an initial license  may be renewed annually and are typically set at a percentage of the license fee 
a large portion of our direct sales to customers have maintenance and support contracts that entitle the customers to software patches  updates and upgrades at no additional cost  and when available  unlimited access to our web based customer support information and request system and direct assistance from the customer support hotline 
customers submit their assistance requests directly into our case tracking database via the web or a customer support engineer records the request in the database at the time of the call to the hotline

the siebel service implementation included a direct integration with product development s rational program to allow visibility of development efforts on an ongoing basis and thus provide a tight collaborative relationship with that organization 
as of march   our services and support organization consisted of full time employees 
competition we compete in the business intelligence software market 
this market is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
this market is also characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
we expect competition in the market to increase 
our primary competitors include actuate  business objects  cognos  crystal decisions  e 
piphany  informatica  microstrategy  and oracle 
our competitive position in the market is uncertain  due principally to the variety of current and potential competitors  and the emerging nature of the market 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than us 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies develop business intelligence software and analytics products and technologies 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and new competitors may form alliances  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves  thereby enhancing their ability to compete in our market with their combined resources 
our current or future indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  limiting our ability to sell our products through particular distribution channels 
accordingly  competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain new licenses and maintenance and support renewals for existing licenses  on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures may require us to reduce the price of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we compete on the basis of the following factors completeness of product features including analytical capabilities  open architecture and scalability  ease of use and ease of administration  customer support  speed to solution for customer applications  and competitive pricing 
we believe we presently compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
however  our market is still evolving and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to do so successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
proprietary rights we currently rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
because trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection  we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under patent laws 
we currently have two united states patents and thirteen pending patent applications 
the patent applications may not result in the issuance of a patent and we may not obtain any more patents 
our issued patent and any additional patents to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents might not provide us competitive advantages 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
the legal protection is limited 
unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we believe is proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts they have made with us 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is time consuming  has an uncertain outcome and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
additionally  as a smaller company with limited resources  we may choose not to pursue some intellectual property litigation claims against competitors who may be violating our intellectual property rights 
we have entered into two source code escrow agreements with data securities international  inc dsi the flex safe escrow agreement the flex safe agreement and the master preferred escrow agreement the preferred agreement  and  together with the flex safe agreement  the escrow agreements 
a number of customers and indirect channel partners are beneficiaries to one of the escrow agreements  which require release of source code from dsi upon a brio s insolvency or liquidation  in the case of the flex safe agreement  and b negotiated provisions  typically insolvency and failure to provide support or an alternative means of support  in the case of the preferred agreement collectively  release conditions 
the escrow agreements provide that the beneficiary customer partner will have a limited  non exclusive right to use the source code solely for the purposes of supporting licensed brio software  subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying software license agreement 
it is our policy to update the escrowed source code with at least each major upgrade of software 
in the event that a release condition occurs and is continuing  release of escrowed source code to beneficiary customers partners may increase the likelihood of misappropriation by third parties 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend and require us to enter into royalty  settlement or licensing agreements at substantial costs 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
finally  in the future we may rely upon software that we license from third parties  including software that may be integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain or maintain any third party software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent software is developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of march   we had full time employees  including in sales and marketing  in services and support  in research and development and in general and administrative functions 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
if we fail to attract and retain high quality employees  our business operations and operating revenues may be impaired 
our recent workforce reductions may hurt the morale and loyalty of our employees 
additionally  the recent reduction or elimination of cash bonuses  cash incentive plans and some employee fringe benefits may reduce incentives for our employees to remain with us 
we have employment contracts with five members of our executive management personnel and do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive management 
we depend on a direct sales force for the majority of our product sales 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel 
due to the state of the economy and the increasingly competitive nature of the marketplace  fewer members of our sales force met quotas in fiscal year than in historical periods 
this issue  in addition to our recent reduction or elimination of cash bonuses  cash incentive plans and some employee fringe benefits  may make it difficult for us to retain a qualified sales force 
in the last thirteen months  we have experienced significant turnover of our sales force  including two executive vice presidents of worldwide sales 
as turnover tends to slow our sales efforts while replacement personnel are recruited and trained  our revenue generating ability may be impaired 
in april  we announced an immediate reduction in our worldwide workforce 
we anticipate recording a restructuring charge between and million during the quarter ending june  related to this workforce reduction

see risk factors that may affect future operating results for a description of the risks related to our operating results fluctuations in future periods 
in august  we completed the merger with sqribe technologies corp 
sqribe  a delaware corporation 
we acquired all of the outstanding shares of sqribe preferred and common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction for approximately million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we assumed all outstanding stock options and warrants of sqribe 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated  in accordance with required pooling of interests accounting and disclosures 
impact of economic downturn due to the severe economic downturn experienced during the period of april  to march   we experienced a reduction in total revenues for each of the quarters during fiscal when compared to fiscal total revenues were million for the three months ended june  compared to million for the three months ended june   million for the three months ended september  compared to million for the three months ended september   million for the three months ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and million for the three months ended march  compared to million for the three months ended march  the impact was initially felt through a marked reduction in the deal pipeline and a slowing of contract closings throughout the year 
we experienced a decrease in our customers capital spending and sales to these customers generally became progressively smaller 
in response to the revenue decline  we have taken several actions to reduce our operating expenses during fiscal specifically  we have reduced our headcount by employees  from employees at march  to employees at march   closed underutilized facilities  written down the associated leasehold improvements and reduced overall operating expenses 
in addition  during fiscal  liquidity became a concern as expense reduction lagged revenue declines during the year 
as a result  we increased our efforts to expedite collections and shorten days sales outstanding dso 
these events allowed us to improve liquidity by securing a new credit line in december and raising additional equity capital during the three months ended march  see the liquidity and capital resources section for additional information 
in april  we announced an immediate reduction in our worldwide workforce 
we anticipate recording a restructuring charge between and million during the quarter ending june  related to this workforce reduction 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  long lived assets  income taxes and restructuring 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from two sources  license fees and services 
services include software maintenance and support  training and system implementation consulting 
maintenance and support consists of technical support and software upgrades and enhancements 
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
we apply the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we use the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services 
we use a purchase order or a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for sales of software  maintenance renewals and training 
sales through our vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors collectively resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we use a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement for system implementation consulting 
software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cd rom 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
our standard payment terms are generally less than days 
in instances where payments are subject to extended payment terms  revenue is deferred until payments become due  which is generally when the payment is received 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
when licenses are sold together with consulting and implementation services  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting and implementation services  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  both the product license revenues and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the implementation services  we account for the arrangements under the percentage of completion method pursuant to sop when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method is utilized 
the majority of our consulting and implementation services qualify for separate accounting 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the services and maintenance to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
our consulting and implementation service contracts are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for a fixed fee contract  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
training revenue is recognized when training is provided 
prior to march   revenue on product sales through our resellers was recognized upon delivery to the reseller 
effective march   we revised our revenue recognition policy to resellers such that revenue is now typically recognized when the product has been sold through to an end user and such sell through has been reported to us 
the change in policy had no impact on revenue for fiscal the collection of payments on sales to resellers is not contingent or linked to the end customer paying the reseller and there are no rights of return 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  changes in customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management had made different judgments or uses different estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically review long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results thatare used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
restructuring we have restructured certain facilities and have established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost as required by accounting standards against outstanding commitments for leased properties that we have abandoned 
these reserves are based upon our estimate of triggering events  such as  the time required to sublease the property and the amount of sublease income that might be generated from the date of abandonment and the expiration of the lease 
these estimates are reviewed based on changes in these triggering events 
adjustments to the restructuring charge will be made in future periods  if necessary  should different conditions prevail from those anticipated in our original estimate

total revenues decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the slowing global economy and the september  tragedy  which in combination has resulted in continuing lengthening of the enterprise sales cycle and deferred it spending 
as a result  there was a reduction in the number and size of deals closed and the mix of license and service revenues  specifically training and consulting revenues  varied significantly when compared to historical results 
total revenues increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased license revenue and related maintenance and support revenue 
revenues by geographic location were as follows years ended march  revenues by geography domestic international total revenues revenues from international sources decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to fewer sales in the asia pacific region due to the slowing global economy

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about revenues in geographic areas 
license fees 
revenues from license fees decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the slowing global economy  combined with the september  tragedy  which resulted in continued lengthening of the enterprise sales cycle and deferred it spending

services revenues increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase was due to an increase in maintenance and support revenues  million of the increase was due to an increase in reimbursable expenses  and million of the increase was due to an increase in training and consulting revenues related to our installed customer base 
cost of revenues license fees 
cost of revenues from license fees consists primarily of product packaging  shipping  media  documentation and related personnel and overhead allocations 
cost of revenues from license fees decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the decrease in license revenues and the mix of customers purchasing master disks relative to customers shrink wrapped product 
cost of revenues from license fees increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the mix of customers purchasing master disks relative to customers purchasing shrink wrapped product 
cost of revenues from license fees may vary between periods due to the mix of customers purchasing master disks relative to customers purchasing shrink wrapped product 
services 
cost of revenues from services consists primarily of personnel costs and third party consulting fees associated with providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services 
cost of revenues from services decreased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the workforce reduction in the services organizations providing a savings of  offset by a stock compensation charge of  as well as a decrease in the use of outside consultants of million  an overall decrease in discretionary spending of  and a decrease in reimbursable expenses of million  offset by an increase of million in allocations of facilities  it and human resource costs 
cost of revenues from services increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase was due to increases in personnel and related costs resulting from our expansion of our support services in response to increased demand for maintenance and support and training and consulting services  million was due to the increase in reimbursable expenses and million of the increase was due to an increased use of outside consultants for training and consulting services 
cost of revenues from services may vary between periods due to varying levels of expenditures required to build the services organization 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due the workforce reduction in the research and development organization providing a savings of million  offset by the stock compensation charge of  and an overall decrease in costs compared to the ramp up of the organization in the prior year 
research and development expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase from year to year was primarily due to increased personnel and related costs required to continue to develop new products and enhance existing products 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to vary as a percentage of total revenue as we may commit substantial resources to research and development in the future as it believes that investment for research and development is essential to product and technical leadership 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  commissions  bonuses and sales incentives  travel  marketing programs such as trade shows and seminars and promotion costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal substantially all of the decrease was due to lower commission expenses of million in the sales organization relating to the decrease in total revenues and the workforce reduction in the sales and marketing organizations providing a savings of million  offset by the stock compensation charge of  as well as a decrease in the use of outside marketing services of million and lower allocations of facilities  it and human resource costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing organization  including domestically through the growth of the telesales organization  internationally through the establishment of subsidiary offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  japan  singapore  hong kong and australia in addition to the expansion of the worldwide field sales organization and approximately million of the increase was attributable to higher sales commissions  bonuses and sales incentives associated with increased total revenues 
the remaining increase of approximately million was attributable to increased domestic and international marketing expenses  including marketing activities  personnel and related costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to vary as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources and general management  as well as legal  accounting and unallocated overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the overall decrease in discretionary spending and the workforce reduction in the general and administrative organization providing a savings of million  offset by the stock compensation charge of million and additional bad debt expense recorded for uncollectible accounts of  general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs 
we expect that that its general and administrative expenses will continue to vary as a percentage of total revenues 
non recurring expenses 
in june  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to align our expenses with its revenues 
non recurring expenses for the year ended march  consist of restructuring charges related to severance costs associated with workforce reductions in various organizations across the company and facilities consolidation expenses and the abandonment of property and equipment as follows in thousands year ended march  restructuring charges abandonment of property and equipment total non recurring expenses the restructuring charges as of march  are as follows in thousands severance and related benefits lease loss total restructuring total charge amount utilized accrual balance at march  during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded approximately million in costs associated with severance and related benefits 
we reduced our headcount by approximately employees  of which related to cost of services  related to research and development  related to sales and marketing and employees related to the general and administrative area 
we expect to save an estimated million annually in salary and related benefits as a result of this reduction in headcount 
all termination notices and benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to the end of each quarter and all employees have been terminated as of march  in addition  the facility consolidations are expected to lower facilities expenses that would have been incurred had brio continued to occupy the leased facilities it abandoned by  annually 
the facilities consolidation expenses include payments required under a lease contract  less applicable estimated sublease income after the property was abandoned 
to determine the lease loss  certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the building will remain vacant  sublease terms  sublease rates and an estimate of brokerage fees 
the lease loss is an estimate under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and represents the low end of the estimate of time to sublease  actual sublease rates  etc 
we have estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be an additional  if operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in this market and should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility 
for the fiscal year ended march    of the non recurring expenses related to the abandonment of property and equipment  specifically the write off of costs associated with the implementation of siebel s sales force automation system 
the abandonment and write off was the result of significant changes implemented in the sales organization 
in order to align the system with these changes  we had to modify and simplify our siebel implementation  resulting in the abandonment of a significant portion of the system and its related cost of implementation 
non recurring operating expenses for fiscal are comprised of merger and restructuring costs related to the sqribe merger and the settlement of our patent litigation with business objects as follows in thousands march  merger and restructuring costs settlement costs total non recurring operating expenses our merger with sqribe was completed on august  in fiscal  merger and restructuring costs of million consisted of million in transaction and related professional fees   in severance costs to terminate employees  million in merger integration expenses   in consolidation of facilities   in equipment retirements and  in other miscellaneous merger related expenses 
all termination notices and benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to year end and all of the merger related expenses were incurred prior to year end 
substantially all of the merger related charges were paid during fiscal on september   we settled a patent infringement action with business objects 
pursuant to the settlement we agreed to pay to business objects million  payable quarterly in million payments over quarters  with the first payment due september  the million of settlement costs represent the net present value of the quarterly payments and the remaining  represents interest and will be recognized over the payment term using the effective interest rate method 
stock compensation charges 
in november  we commenced an option exchange program under which eligible employees were given the opportunity to exchange approximately million of their existing options to purchase our common stock for new options  with a new exercise price of and the same vesting schedule as the original options 
the right to exchange terminated on december   of which approximately million shares elected the option 
this option exchange program is deemed an option repricing and therefore  variable plan accounting applies 
for each interim period  we will determine the change in fair value of the options that have not been exercised  cancelled or expired  and will record an expense based on the vesting schedule of the options 
if there is a reduction in the market value of the options  we will record a reduction in the stock compensation expense  but not in excess of what has been recognized to date 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recognized stock compensation expense of approximately million relating to the option exchange program 
in december and january  we modified certain stock option grants in connection with terminations that resulted in additional non cash stock compensation of  stock bonus program 
to conserve our cash until we could raise additional equity financing and to help us achieve cash flow positive results of operations for the year ended march   we temporarily reduced the salaries of all north american and some international employees during november and december to balance the impact on employees of the salary reduction  and to incent our employees to remain with us  we implemented a stock bonus program the program in november under the program  if we were to achieve cash flow positive results of operations for the quarter ended december   employees who remained with us on various dates through july  as set forth in the program  would receive a fixed dollar amount bonus  payable at the discretion of the brio board of directors in either cash or shares of common stock 
if amounts payable under the stock bonus program are paid in common stock  the number of shares to be issued is determined by the total value of the bonus divided by the market value of the stock on the applicable date of issuance 
we achieved cash flow positive results of operations for the quarter ended december   and recorded an expense of million relating to the bonus program during the fiscal year ended march  the first installment of the bonus was paid in january by the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the remaining payments will be made in two additional installments one in april and one in july the income tax on the stock bonus will be approximately  and is classified in accrued liabilities 
the net amount of  is classified in additional paid in capital 
in addition  certain executives agreed to receive their guaranteed bonuses of an aggregate of  in stock rather than cash 
the guaranteed bonuses were paid in january by the issuance of  shares of common stock 
deferred compensation 
in connection with the granting of  stock options to employees during fiscal  with a weighted average exercise price of per share and a weighted average deemed fair market value of per share  we recorded deferred compensation of  representing the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
in addition  we granted  stock options to employees during fiscal  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  with a weighted average deemed fair market value of per share and recorded the difference between the deemed fair market value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant as  of compensation expense and  of deferred compensation 
such amounts are presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options 
approximately  was expensed during fiscal  approximately  was expensed during fiscal  and approximately  was expensed during fiscal all amounts have been fully amortized as of march  interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  is comprised primarily of interest income of  foreign currency transaction gains of  and realized losses from the sale of investments of  net of interest expense and other expense of  interest expense of  is comprised of interest charges relating to the business objects litigation settlement and interest incurred on our bank line of credit 
interest and other income expense  net  increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and lower interest charges relating to the business objects litigation 
interest and other income expense  net  decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to interest charges relating to the business objects litigation settlement  lower cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and a higher loss on foreign currency translations resulting from inter company receivables from foreign subsidiaries 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of foreign currency transactions and our policy related to accounting for short term investments 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal year consisted primarily of current income taxes generated from international operations 
the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal and  in fiscal consisted primarily of income taxes generated from international operations and federal and state alternative minimum taxes as we utilized net operating loss carryforwards to offset current income taxes generated from domestic operations 
at march   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards both of which expire at various dates through we also had approximately million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which expire at various dates through or carryforward indefinitely 
in addition  we had federal r d tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  state r d tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates through we believe that  based on a number of factors  there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of carryforwards and credits and has therefore provided a valuation allowance for a significant portion of its deferred tax asset at march  these factors include a history of operating losses  the competitive nature of our market and the lack of predictability of revenue 
management will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
furthermore  the internal revenue code contains provisions which may limit the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including a significant change in ownership 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting statndards board fasb issued sfas no 
s and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles 
fasb requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fasb  which is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december   goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair value based test 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
in accordance with the transition provisions  we adopted this standard effective april  the remaining balance of goodwill at april  was immaterial  and therefore  the impact of adopting this fasb was insignificant 
in july  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf generally requires that consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be classified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as an offset to revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf clarifies and modifies certain items discussed in eitf we are required to adopt these new standards effective march   and comparative financial statements are required to be reclassified to comply with the new pronouncement 
we believe the adoption of eitf  will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
and certain provisions of apb opinion sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and redefines the valuation and presentation of discontinued operations 
the provisions of this statement are effective beginning with fiscal years starting after december  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the eitf issued eitf no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which concluded that the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses should be classified as revenue in the statement of operations 
eitf is effective for financial reporting periods beginning after december  upon application of this eitf  comparative financial statements for prior periods will be reclassified to comply with this eitf 
effective march   we adopted eitf and reclassified the statement of operations for the year ended march  to conform to the current year presentation 
however  we can not reclassify the march  statement of operations as it is impractical due to the merger with sqribe in august the effect of this adoption is an increase in revenues and cost of revenues of  and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in december  we cancelled our million accounts receivable based bank line of credit with silicon valley bank 
in addition  in january  a  letter of credit issued by the same bank to support a facilities lease was cancelled 
in december  we entered into an accounts receivable based revolving bank line of credit with foothill capital 
the line provides for up to million in borrowings  with interest at the bank s prime rate plus one percent at march  
credit available under the line of credit will be reduced by the amount outstanding under a term loan in the amount of up to million  with interest at the bank s prime rate plus three percent at march   and by any outstanding letters of credit 
borrowings under the bank line are limited to of non maintenance  domestic eligible accounts receivable 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including our intellectual property  accounts receivable and property and equipment to the extent required to secure the line 
under the prior line of credit that we had with silicon valley bank loan  we were required to maintain the following financial covenants a a monthly quick ratio of to  and b i a maximum quarterly loss of  for the quarter ended march    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended december   and ii profitable for the quarter ended march  the line of credit with foothill capital initially required us to a maintain minimum ebitda of  for the quarter ended march    for the quarter ending june    for the quarter ending september   and  for each quarter thereafter  b minimum recurring domestic maintenance revenues of  for each quarter  c minimum excess availability under the credit line plus cash equivalents of at least  at any time  and d maximum capital expenditures of  per quarter 
on february   we amended the initial line of credit with foothill capital to change the definition of ebitda to add back extraordinary non cash losses of up to  occurring before june  as of march   we were not in compliance with the minimum ebitda covenant  but obtained a waiver from foothill capital 
additionally  the covenants were amended on a prospective basis requiring us to maintain a maximum ebitda loss of  for the quarter ending june  future covenant requirements are a minimum ebitda of  for the quarter ending september    for the quarter ending december   and  for each quarter thereafter 
for the quarter ending june   the definition of ebitda has also been amended to include an add back of a one time non cash expense resulting from the devaluation of our computers and related technology in an aggregate amount not to exceed  although our ability to comply with these covenants is uncertain because of the risk factors highlighted in this document  we believe that we will be in compliance with these covenants through fiscal as of march   million was outstanding under the term loan  of which million is classified as short term and million is classified as long term 
the term loan amortizes over months and requires monthly payments of  plus interest 
the line of credit has prepayment penalties of up to three percent 
the line of credit expires in december as of march   based on domestic eligible accounts receivable there were million of additional borrowings available under the line of credit 
as of march   no amounts other than the term loan are outstanding under the line of credit 
as part of the merger with sqribe  we assumed a million bank line of credit 
during fiscal  all amounts outstanding under the line were paid and the line was cancelled 
we also assumed a million equipment purchase line of credit under which a  letter of credit was outstanding to support a facilities lease 
during fiscal  the line and the associated letter of credit were cancelled 
during the fiscal year ended march   we negotiated a reduction for certain implementation services with a vendor for  this was reflected as a reduction in property and equipment and accounts payable 
in addition  we negotiated an extension for payment to a vendor  evidenced in the form of a note payable for  that bore interest at five percent per annum and was paid as of march  net cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal and  in fiscal net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal the increase in net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in net loss  offset by million of favorable changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities  non cash related loss on abandonment of property and equipment of million  and million of non cash related stock compensation charges

we have implemented several cash conservation measures to help improve our overall cash position 
specifically  we have cut expenses through reductions in headcount across the organization  a temporary salary reduction in november and december for all north american and certain international employees  reduced and or eliminated cash bonus and cash incentive programs  reduced or eliminated employee fringe benefit programs and delayed or eliminated capital expenditure plans 
we will continue to evaluate and implement additional cash conservation measures as circumstances dictate 
in april  we announced an immediate reduction in our worldwide workforce 
we anticipate recording a restructuring charge between and million during the quarter ending june  related to this workforce reduction 
the following table summarizes our obligations to make future cash payments under non cancelable contracts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to ours  which may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through march based upon our projections  which have certain assumptions with regard to future levels of revenues and expenditures 
if these assumptions are not achieved  additional cash may be required prior to march we may sell additional equity or debt securities or modify or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our cash position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
risk factors that may affect future operating results we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section b and rule b under the securities and exchange act of specifically  we wish to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in reports we have filed with the sec and incorporated into this annual report on form k by reference  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  our actual results and could cause our results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
risks factors relating to our business our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past 
we do not always meet financial analysts expectations  which has caused and may cause our share price to decrease significantly 
we have experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our operating results are difficult to predict and we do not always meet the expectations of some securities analysts 
if our operating results do not meet analysts expectations in the future  our common stock price could decrease significantly 
for example  in the quarters ending june   september  and march   we did not meet analysts expectations for our revenues  expenses or earnings per share  and following the announcement of the results for each of these quarters the price of our shares declined 
there are a number of factors that contribute to the fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  including long sales cycle 
our sales cycle is typically six to twelve months long 
large scale deployments take longer to evaluate  implement and close and they frequently require more customer education about the use and benefit of our products 
additionally  unexpected budgeting constraints of our prospective customers  particularly during the recent period of worldwide economic slowdown  may arise during the course of a long sales cycle and may delay or disrupt sales 
we anticipate that an increasing portion of our revenue could be derived from larger orders 
also  the product sales cycle in international markets has been  and is expected to continue to be  longer than the sales cycle in the united states and canada 
these issues make it difficult to predict the quarter in which expected orders will occur 
delays in order execution could cause some or all of the revenues from those orders to be shifted from the expected quarter to a subsequent quarter or quarters 
seasonality 
seasonal changes in our customers spending patterns can cause fluctuations in our operating results 
for example  in the past  our customers slower seasonal spending patterns have hurt our results of operations particularly in the quarters ending june or september weak global economic conditions 
general economic conditions affect the demand for our products 
beginning in the june quarter of fiscal  the slowing global economy caused many of our prospective customers to reduce budget allocations for technology spending 
the terrorist attacks of september  and continued international violence have increased uncertainty as to the worldwide economic environment  which we believe caused deferral of information technology purchases including our products 
in particular  the size of deals has declined during the past four quarters and we expect them to remain more conservative in size than in historical periods 
introduction of product enhancements and new products 
the announcement or introduction of product enhancements or new products by us or by our competitors  or any change in industry standards may cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products 
we anticipate continuing releases of new products and product enhancements throughout fiscal mix of license and service revenues 
our revenues are derived from two sources  license fees and services 
both of these sources are essential to our business  but our profit margin is higher on license fees than it is on services 
as the mix of license and service revenues varies between quarters  our profits fluctuate  which can cause fluctuations in our quarterly results 
the mix of licensing fees and services is difficult to predict because it is influenced by many factors  some of which are beyond our ability to control  including the timing of new product introductions  success in promotion of new products  customers renewing maintenance and support contracts  customers needs for professional services and training and customers budgets for information technology spending 
however  the mix has shifted towards services during there are many additional steps we must take in order to overcome our history of net losses  and there is no guarantee that we can accomplish these steps or that we will be profitable in the future 
we have a history of net losses 
in particular  we incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as of march   we had stockholders equity of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
if we do not successfully take steps to overcome our net losses  we may never achieve profitability 
examples of areas that we must address to achieve profitability include successfully implementing cost reduction measures 
we must continue to implement cost reduction measures to improve our overall cash position and align our expenses with revenues 
however  this is challenging for us because if we implement too many cost reduction measures  we may lose the ability to attract  retain and motivate personnel  which could be detrimental to our business 
for the fiscal year ended march   we cut expenses through a workforce reduction  a temporary salary reduction for all north american and some international employees  reduction or elimination of cash bonuses  cash incentive plans and some employee fringe benefits  and the delay or elimination of capital expenditure plans 
in april  we announced an immediate reduction in our worldwide workforce 
we anticipate recording a restructuring charge between and million during the quarter ending june  related to this workforce reduction 
successfully managing the capacity of our direct sales force and services organization 
maintaining more sales and service organization employees than is necessary to fulfill market opportunities leads to higher overhead costs without proportional revenue from greater product and service sales 
if we fail to size the organization properly for market opportunities  it could have a negative impact on operating results 
achieving higher rates of revenue growth 
maintaining and increasing our rate of revenue growth is a significant factor for achieving profitability 
we may not soon reverse recent revenue declines or again achieve or sustain the rates of revenue growth we experienced in the past 
our prospects for increased future revenues depend on our ability to successfully increase the scope of our operations  expand and maintain indirect sales channels worldwide  improve our competitive position in the marketplace  educate the market on the need for deployment of enterprise wide analytical solutions  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
increasing indirect sales channels while maintaining management focus on execution of overall strategy 
selling our products through indirect sales channels  including vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors expands our reach into the marketplace 
we need to attract and retain additional indirect channel partners that will be able to market our products effectively and provide timely and cost effective customer support and services 
we may not succeed in increasing indirect channel partner relationships  and this could limit our ability to grow revenues and achieve profitability 
managing indirect sales channels  however  may require more management attention than managing our direct sales force 
if the indirect sales channels grow  management attention may be diverted  impairing our ability to execute other parts of our strategy 
to date we have generated a majority of sales through our direct sales force 
our indirect sales channels accounted for less than of total revenues for fiscal and less than of total revenues in each of fiscal and there are many strong competitors in our industry who have been and may continue to be more successful in attracting and retaining customers  which could result in fewer customer orders  price reductions  further loss of market share and reduced gross margins 
we compete in the business intelligence software market 
this market is highly competitive and we expect competition in the market to increase 
our competitors offer a variety of software solutions that our prospective customers could choose instead of our products 
for example  cognos and business objects offer business intelligence software that provides reporting and analysis capability that is similar to ours 
there are also numerous other vendors such as microstrategy  actuate and crystal decisions that are selling competitive products 
additionally  companies such as microsoft  ibm and oracle  offer client products that operate specifically with their proprietary databases 
these and other competitors pose business risks to us because they compete for the same customers that we try to attract  if we lose customers to our competitors  it may be difficult or impossible to win them back  lower prices and a smaller market share could limit our revenue generating ability  reduce our gross margins and restrict our ability to become profitable or to sustain profitability  and they may be able to devote greater resources to quickly respond to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to the development  promotion and sales of their products 
market consolidation may create more formidable competitors that are able to capture a larger market share 
current and new competitors may form alliances  make strategic acquisitions or establish other cooperative relationships among themselves  thereby enhancing their ability to compete in our market with their combined resources 
for example  in january  crystal decisions announced a strategic oem and reseller agreement with hyperion 
these types of agreements between our competitors could be harmful to our business because consolidated or allied competitors could rapidly gain significant market share  possibly taking customers away from us  form relationships with our current or future indirect channel partners  possibly displacing our existing relationships and impeding our ability to expand our indirect sales channels  and force us to reduce prices to compete  possibly impacting our profitability or ability to become profitable 
we may not successfully develop new and enhanced versions of our products that meet changing customer requirements in a timely manner  which could impair our ability to maintain market acceptance and remain competitive 
in our industry there is a continual emergence of new technologies and continual change in customer requirements 
in order to remain competitive  we must introduce new products or product enhancements that meet customers requirements in a timely manner 
if we are unable to do this  we may lose current and prospective customers to our competitors 
our products incorporate a number of advanced and complex technologies  including data analysis systems  a distributed architecture  and web access and delivery technology 
rapidly developing and delivering new and improved products is very challenging from an engineering perspective  and in the past  particularly with our efforts in the unix server environment  we experienced delays in software development 
we may experience these types of delays in future product development activities 
the new and enhanced versions of our products may not offer competitive features or be successfully marketed to our customers and prospective customers  which could hurt our competitive position 
we must successfully market new and enhanced versions of our products for customers to remain competitive with our competitors products 
in order to be competitive and well received in the marketplace  our new products and product enhancements must provide a complete offering of product features including analytical capabilities  open architecture and scalability  provide top level performance  quality  and ease of use  include customer support packages  be completed and brought to market in a timely manner  and be competitively priced 
our failure to compete favorably in these areas could limit our ability to attract and retain customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial conditions 
we may not successfully market larger  enterprise wide implementations of our products  which could impair our future revenue growth 
we expect that larger  enterprise wide implementations of our products will constitute an increasing portion of any future revenue growth  so we must successfully market and focus our selling efforts on these enterprise wide implementations 
failure to succeed in this effort may limit our growth potential and adversely impact our business goals 
in the past our selling efforts have resulted in limited enterprise wide implementations of our products 
we believe that most companies are not yet aware of the benefits of enterprise wide business intelligence solutions 
additional risks of focusing our selling efforts on this area include that our efforts may not be sufficient to build market awareness of the need for enterprise wide solutions  that the market may not accept our products for enterprise wide solutions  and that the market for enterprise wide solutions may not be as large as we anticipate and it may not continue to grow 
defects in our products could increase our costs  adversely affect our reputation  diminish demand for our products  and hurt our operating results 
as a result of their complexity  our software products may contain undetected errors or viruses 
errors in new products or product enhancements might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments  which could result in additional costs  delays  possible damage to our reputation and could cause diminished demand for our products 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance or sell new licenses 
also  any defects or viruses found in our products by our customers could cause our customers to seek damages for loss of data  lost revenue  systems costs or other harm they suffer 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure for potential claims based on product error or malfunctions 
these limitation of liability provisions may not be effective under the laws of all jurisdictions 
our insurance against product liability risks may not be adequate to cover a potential claim 
a product liability claim brought against us could adversely affect our reputation  operating results and financial condition 
because we depend on a direct sales force  any failure to attract and retain qualified sales personnel could slow our sales  impeding our revenue generating ability and causing significant financial and operational risks 
we depend on a direct sales force for the majority of our product sales 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel 
due to the state of the economy and the increasingly competitive nature of the marketplace  fewer members of our sales force met quotas in fiscal year than in historical periods 
this issue  in addition to our recent reduction or elimination of cash bonuses  cash incentive plans and some employee fringe benefits  may make it difficult for us to retain a qualified sales force 
we have experienced significant turnover of our sales force  including two executive vice presidents of worldwide sales in the last thirteen months 
as turnover tends to slow our sales efforts while replacement personnel are recruited and trained  our revenue generating ability may be impaired 
we may not continue to attract and retain high quality employees in our management  engineering and marketing departments 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions from these employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contribution from employees in our management  engineering and marketing departments 
if we fail to attract and retain high quality employees  our business operations and operating revenues may be impaired 
our recent workforce reductions may hurt the morale and loyalty of our employees 
additionally  the recent reduction or elimination of cash bonuses  cash incentive plans and some employee fringe benefits may reduce incentives for our employees to remain with us 
because our management team has many new members  there is no certainty that they will work well together or be able to effectively manage our operations 
we hired a new president and chief executive officer in january and since that time the entire executive management team has changed 
because our management team has limited experience working together  they may not effectively manage our operations 
management ineffectiveness could disrupt our entire business operation  distract our employees and impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
our patented intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide us competitive advantages in our industry 
we have two issued patents and thirteen pending patent applications 
the patent applications may not result in the issuance of a patent  and we may not obtain any more patents 
our issued patents and any additional patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents might not provide us competitive advantages 
our intellectual property protection may not be adequate to prevent competitors from entering our markets or developing competing products  which could reduce our revenues or cause us to incur costly litigation 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
the legal protection is limited 
unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we believe is proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts they have made with us 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is time consuming  has an uncertain outcome and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
for example  in business objects instituted patent litigation against us and in we instituted patent litigation against business objects 
these lawsuits took a total of two years and eight months to conclude 
additionally  as a smaller company with limited resources  we may choose not to pursue some patent litigation claims against competitors who may be violating our patents 
our plans to expand internationally expose us to risks related to managing international operations  currency exchange rates  regulatory and other risks associated with foreign operations 
we may not successfully address these risks  which could harm our operating results 
a key component of our strategy is continued expansion into international markets 
if the international revenues generated by these expanded operations are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 
in our efforts to expand our international presence we will face certain risks  which we may not be successful in addressing 
these risks include difficulties localizing our products for foreign countries  difficulties finding staff to manage foreign operations and collect cash  liability or financial exposure under foreign laws and regulatory requirements  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  our international sales are generally denominated and collected in foreign currencies  and we have not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential foreign currency exposure 
we incurred losses on foreign currency translations resulting from inter company receivables from foreign subsidiaries in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we may acquire new businesses and technologies  as well as enter into business combinations  which may involve integration and transaction completion risks  and which could negatively impact our business 
in august we acquired sqribe technologies corp sqribe 
since that time we have considered various other business combination opportunities 
we may in the future pursue and enter into other business combinations 
acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and distract the attention of management 
additionally  we may not be successful in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  which could materially harm our business 
acquisitions also expose us to unknown liabilities and additional costs for technology integration 
for example  it proved very difficult to integrate the sales  development and support teams between sqribe and us due to differences in culture  geographical locations and duplication of key talent 
this resulted in higher than expected operating expenses 
the loss of services of arthur andersen llp could harm investors in this offering or cause us significant cost or delay 
arthur andersen llp is our independent public accountant  who issues our audit report with respect to our financial statements 
arthur andersen llp was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation 
arthur andersen llp may fail  may merge with or have its assets sold to a third party  or may lose critical personnel 
in the event that arthur andersen llp fails or does not otherwise continue in business  arthur andersen llp may have insufficient assets to satisfy any claims made by investors or by us with respect to our filings 
additionally  we are required to file with the securities and exchange commission annual financial statements audited by independent auditors 
the securities and exchange commission has stated that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  if arthur andersen llp is able to represent to us that there was appropriate continuity of arthur andersen llp personnel working on our audit and availability of national office consultation 
in the event that arthur andersen llp is unable to continue to provide audit services to us  or if the sec declines to accept financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  our access to the capital markets may be impeded and we could experience significant additional cost or delay in completing our periodic reports required to be filed with the sec 
risks related to our securities market and ownership of our common stock we have anti takeover provisions that may adversely affect our stock price and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our charter documents contain provisions that may delay or prevent us from a change in control 
these include provisions creating a classified board of directors  eliminating cumulative voting  eliminating the ability of stockholders to take actions by written consent  and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
additionally  our board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares  including voting rights  without stockholder approval 
the rights of our common stock holders may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our stock price may be volatile because of the stock price volatility of other companies in our industry  and as a result you may lose all or part of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced periods of high volatility and it is likely that the market price of our common stock will continue to be volatile 
broad market fluctuations  as well as economic conditions generally and in the software industry specifically  may result in material adverse effects on the market price of our common stock 
the cost of possible securities class action litigation could increase our expenses and damage our reputation with prospective and existing customers 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
our common stock price has been volatile  fluctuating from a low sales price of to a high sales price of during fiscal if litigation were instituted against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment policy  which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments with a weighted average variable rate of 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
we currently have limited cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations 
we have entered into borrowing agreements to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs  should the need arise 
as of march   million was outstanding under the term loan see note  of which million is classified as short term and million is classified as long term 
the term loan is due over months in monthly payments of  plus interest 
we conduct business on a global basis in international currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
brio may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency commitments and balance sheet positions 
at march  there were no outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
