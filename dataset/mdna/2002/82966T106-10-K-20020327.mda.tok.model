item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  potential  or continue  the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including those described above under risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis below of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
excess and obsolete inventories we record provisions for excess inventories based on the cost of inventory levels exceeding the forecasted demand of such products 
we forecast demand for specific products based on the number of products we expect to sell with such assumptions dependent on our assessment of market conditions and current and expected orders from our customers  considering that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
if forecasted demand decreases based on our estimates or if inventory levels increase disproportionately to forecasted demand  additional inventory write downs may be required  as was the case in when we recorded additional provisions for excess inventories of million 
likewise  if our estimates were conservative and we ultimately sell inventories that were previously reserved  we would reduce the previously recorded excess inventory provisions which would have a positive impact on our operating results 
in addition  to the extent that we do ultimately sell inventories that were previously reserved  we will disclose the impact on our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived asset impairment we record long lived asset impairment charges when impairment indicators exist and the related undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of long lived assets are less than the carrying value of such assets  as was the case in when we recorded  of impairment charges 
future adverse changes in market conditions or changes in the estimated useful life of our long lived assets could result in new impairment indicators  thereby possibly resulting in impairment charges in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
to date  we have not experienced material losses as a result of our customers inability to pay us 
sales returns we record estimated reductions to revenues for sales returns  primarily related to quality issues  at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our foundry and packaging partners  our sales return obligations are effected by failure rates 
should actual product failure rates and the resulting return of failed products differ from our estimates  revisions to our sales return reserves may be required 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  based on our ability to generate future taxable income  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
although we have provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december   if we have net deferred tax assets recorded in the future and we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets at such time  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made  as was the case in the third quarter of when we incurred charges of million to increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above critical accounting policies  although not meeting the securities and exchange commission s sec definition of a critical accounting policy  we consider the following accounting policies to be very important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements pricing agreements we record estimated reductions to revenue for special pricing agreements with our distributors 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase distributor incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is redeemed 
restructuring charges we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of with the assumption that we would not sublease any of our excess facilities through the end of the respective lease term 
in the event that we sublease any of these excess facilities  an adjustment to our restructuring accrual would be charged to income in the period such a sublease occurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
distributor revenue accounting we recognize revenues on sales to our distributors at the time our products at sold by our distributors to their third party customers 
the recognition of sales to our distributors and the related gross profit on the products held by our distributors is deferred until the sale to the third party customer 
the deferred gross profit is included as deferred margin on distributor inventory on our balance sheet 
on a monthly basis  we reconcile the value of inventory being held by our distributors  as reported by our distributors  to our estimate of the value of ending inventory  considering in transit inventory to and from our distributors and pricing adjustments 
investments subsequent to december   we made an investment in a privately held foundry partner having strategic technology that is recorded under the cost method of accounting 
if management believes the value of its investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary  we would write down the cost of our investment to fair value  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
factors that may cause an other than temporary decline in the value of the our investment in gcs would include  but not be limited to  a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain milestones or a series of operating losses in excess of gcs current business plan  or the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern 
accounting for the valuation of our investment was not a critical accounting policy that impacted  but is expected to be a critical accounting policy in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading designer and supplier of high performance rf components for communications equipment manufacturers 
our products are used primarily in wireless communications equipment to enable and enhance the transmission and reception of voice and data signals 
historically  our products meeting standard specifications widely adopted by communications equipment manufactures have constituted a majority of our revenues and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
our products are also utilized in broadband wireline and terminal applications 
from to  we generated revenues primarily from design services and contract manufacturing services for rf components 
in  we made the strategic decision to discontinue our contract manufacturing services although we continued to fulfill our contractual obligations through march  subsequent to march  we have not derived any of our net revenues from contract manufacturing services 
contract manufacturing customers represented of our total net revenues in and less than of our total net revenues in and there were no employee terminations  facilities charges  disposals of assets or other costs associated with our decision to discontinue our contract manufacturing services 
this decision did not have a material impact on our ongoing results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
we sell our products worldwide through us based distributors  through a private label reseller who sells our products under its brand and through our direct sales force 
our products are also sold through a worldwide network of independent sales representatives whose orders are fulfilled either by distributors or us 
significant portions of our distributors end sales are made to their customers overseas 
sales to customers located in the united states represented approximately of net revenues in sales customers located outside of the united states represented of net revenues in sales to one customer located in the united kingdom represented of net revenues in substantially all of our total assets reside in the united states 
for our direct sales and private label sales  we recognize revenues when the product has been shipped  title has transferred  and no further obligations remain 
although we have never experienced a delay in customer acceptance of our products  should a customer delay acceptance in the future  our policy is to delay revenue recognition until the products are accepted by a customer 
revenues for contract manufacturing services are recognized when the completed assemblies are shipped and no further obligations remain 
provisions for product returns are recorded upon shipment 
revenues from our distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the products to their customers 
two distributors  avnet electronics marketing and richardson electronics laboratories  and a private label reseller of our products  minicircuits laboratories  accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues in  and sales to minicircuits laboratories represented of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in richardson electronics laboratories represented of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in avnet electronics marketing represented of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in richardson electronics laboratories and avnet electronics marketing distribute our products to a large number of end customers 
in addition  sales to one direct customer  pace micro technology plc  accounted for of net revenues in we anticipate that sales to these customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  with the possible exception of minicircuits laboratories 
three of our product lines accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in sales of our gaas hbt products accounted for approximately of our net revenues in sales of our sige hbt products accounted for approximately of our net revenues in sales of our hfet discrete devices accounted for of our net revenues in three of our product lines accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in sales of our gaas hbt products accounted for of our net revenues in sales of our sige hbt products accounted for of our net revenues in sales of our hfet discrete devices accounted for of our net revenues in in  sales of our gaas hbt products accounted for the significant majority of our net revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs of wafers from our third party wafer fabs  costs of packaging performed by third party vendors  costs of testing  costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance and manufacturing engineering and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we subcontract our wafer manufacturing and packaging and do only final testing and tape and reel assembly at our facilities 
in late  we made the decision to outsource a major portion of our production testing operations by the second half of historically  gross margins on our sales through our distributors  to private label resellers and our direct customers have differed materially from each other 
as a result  the relative mix of these sales affects our gross margin 
in addition  we offer a broad range of products in multiple technologies that have different gross margins 
as a result  the relative mix of products sales by technology and within each technology affects our gross margins 
we have also introduced many new products recently  which tend to have higher gross margins than some of our older products 
as a result  the relative mix of newer product sales affects our gross margins 
we do not recognize revenue from our sales to distributors until shipment to the distributor s customer 
we record the deferred margin on distributor inventory on our balance sheet 
as a result  the level of inventory at our distributors can affect our reported gross margin for any particular period 
the gross margin on sales to our private label reseller is traditionally lower than that on our distributor or direct sales 
we generally charge lower prices to our private label reseller due to its commitment to higher volumes on particular products  its absorption of the risk of inventory obsolescence and its agreement to incur the sales and marketing costs for the products 
our gross margin is traditionally lower in periods with less volume and higher in periods with high volume 
we value inventories at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual on a first in  first out basis  or market 
in periods in which volumes are low  our manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to fewer units  thereby  decreasing our gross margin 
likewise  in periods in which volumes are high  our manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to more units  thereby increasing our gross margin 
in  three packaging firms packaged substantially all of our products 
relatives of our founding stockholders own one of these packaging firms  mpi corporation in manila  philippines 
although we utilized four additional packaging subcontractors in  we anticipate that mpi will continue to account for a significant amount of our packaging in the near future 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  material costs for prototype and test units  depreciation and other expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and  to a lesser extent  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities  advertising and public relations 
we pay and expense commissions to our independent sales representatives when revenues from the associated sale are recognized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resources personnel and professional fees 
in october  we issued  shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
the holders of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock had various rights and preferences  including  but not limited to  redemption rights 
in the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we recorded an increase to our accumulated deficit of million and million  respectively  related to the accretion of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock to our estimate of its fair value to reflect its redemption value 
as a result  net income available to common stockholders was reduced 
upon the completion of our initial public offering  the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of common stock and  accordingly  we did not incur any additional accretion charges 
we began operations in and began to generate revenues in until october  we were organized as an s corporation for federal tax reporting purposes and were wholly owned by our founders 
in october  we revoked our election to be treated as an s corporation under the internal revenue code 
results of operations the following table shows selected consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues product revenues contract manufacturing revenues total net revenues cost of revenues exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation gross profit operating expenses research and development exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation sales and marketing exclusive of amortization deferred of stock compensation general and administrative exclusive of amortization of deferred stock compensation restructuring and special charges amortization of deferred stock compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of and net revenues net revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease was the result of the general economic slowdown  the resulting softness in the wireless infrastructure markets  changes in buying patterns by equipment manufacturers worldwide and delays in the next generation wireless infrastructure build out 
sales through our distributors were of net revenues in and of net revenues in sales to our direct customers comprised of net revenues in  of which of net revenues was to our private label reseller and of net revenues was to our factory direct customers 
sales to our direct customers comprised of net revenues in  of which of net revenues was to our private label reseller  of net revenues was to our factory direct customers and of net revenues was from contract manufacturing services  no longer provided by the company 
sales of our newer sige and ingap products were approximately of our total net revenues in compared to in cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of increased provisions for excess inventories  which added costs of approximately million and lower absorption of fixed overhead costs due to lower production volumes 
the increase was partially offset by lower variable costs as a result of our lower production volumes in gross profit gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the increase in provisions for excess inventories and lower production volumes 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of the abandonment and obsolescence of certain research and development equipment and software  which added costs of approximately million  partially offset by lower expenses for engineering material and salaries and salary related expenses 
research and development personnel decreased to at december  from at december  if market conditions improve we may increase our research and development headcount 
likewise  if market conditions continue as in the past few quarters  we may decrease our research and development headcount 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily the result of lower salaries and salary related expenses  which reduced costs by approximately  partially offset by higher advertising expenses  which added costs of approximately  sales and marketing personnel decreased to at december  from at december  if market conditions improve we may increase our sales and marketing headcount 
likewise  if market conditions continue as in the past few quarters  we may decrease our sales and marketing headcount 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily the result of lower salaries and salary related expenses  which reduced costs by approximately  general and administrative personnel decreased to at december  from at december  if market conditions improve we may increase our general and administrative headcount 
likewise  if market conditions continue as in the past few quarters  we may decrease our general and administrative headcount 
restructuring and special charges 
in  companies throughout the worldwide telecommunication industry announced slowdowns or delays in the build out of new wireless and wireline infrastructure 
this resulted in lower equipment production volumes by our customers and efforts to lower their component inventory levels 
these actions by our customers have resulted in a slowdown in our shipments and reduced our visibility regarding future sales 
the revenue decline has occurred across our channels  customer categories  products and technologies 
as a result of these trends  in the fourth quarter of  we took action that resulted in a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities that resulted in a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a result of these trends and other changes in the market place  we realigned our organizational structure to focus on strategic account sales and marketing efforts  centralized engineering  customer and solution business area management and revised our cost structure given our current revenue level 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid a cash dividend of million to our common stockholders in connection with our series a preferred stock financing 
this amount has been recorded in stockholders equity as a distribution to stockholders 
we paid a total of million to certain of our common stockholders and officers of in december as a special bonus to assist these officers with respect to their federal or state taxes associated with the payment of the dividend and certain other items 
we recorded the million as a special charge in the consolidated statement of operations as this amount represents a non recurring transaction that we do not consider to be reflective of our ongoing operations 
in  the above individuals filed their tax returns and refunded  to us  representing the excess amount of bonus received compared to their actual federal and state tax liability 
we recorded the receipt of the  as special charges in the statement of operations  consistent with its presentation in the preceding fiscal year 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of approximately  in and million in  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
during the years ended december   and  we amortized million  million and  respectively  of this deferred stock compensation 
we will amortize the remaining deferred stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options  generally four years 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods was reduced by  in as a result of options for which accrued but unvested compensation had been recorded was forfeited 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease again if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net includes income from our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities  interest expense from capital lease financing obligations and other miscellaneous items 
we had net interest and other income of million in and million in the increase in net interest and other income in compared to is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the settlement of a trademark dispute and lower interest expense as a result of lower capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes we elected to be taxed as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended  through october  consequently  our stockholders were taxed on their proportionate share of the taxable income and no provision for federal income taxes has been provided in the statement of operations for the period beginning january  through october  we recorded a million provision for income taxes in our provision for income taxes in differed from the tax benefit that would be derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before taxes primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and nondeductible amortization charges for deferred stock compensation 
we recorded a million provision for income taxes in our provision for income taxes was recorded at less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the realization of tax net operating loss carryfowards partially offset by nondeductible amortization charges for deferred stock compensation 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets as of december   has been established to reflect these uncertainties 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in and  respectively  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
comparison of and net revenues net revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was the result of increased sales of new products  more effective marketing of our products by us and our distributors  increased availability of our products due to higher inventory levels at our distributors and at our facility and a favorable mix of products sold through both our direct and distribution channels

sales of our new sige and ingap products were approximately of our total net revenues in compared to in cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of increased manufacturing spending related to direct and indirect labor  depreciation  and facilities which added costs of approximately million 
the increase was also the result of increased volume related material and subcontractor costs  and increased inventory reserves 
operations personnel increased to at december  from at december  gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin increased to in from in this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in wafer and packaging costs from our subcontractors due to higher volumes  better utilization of our own testing operations and sales of higher margin products 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of increased salaries and salary related expenses  which added costs of approximately million  increased expenses for engineering materials  which added costs of approximately million  software and equipment depreciation charges and the opening of additional research and development design centers

the provision for income taxes of  in reflects state franchise taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the mix of income among tax jurisdictions and our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the private sale of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock and from the net proceeds received upon completion of our initial public offering in may as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million

in  cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from million of proceeds received from the issuance of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
this was partially offset by dividends paid to our stockholders of million and equipment lease financing of  our december  net loss applicable to common stockholders includes million of accretion charges to increase the carrying amount of our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock to the amount we would be required to pay if this preferred stock were to be redeemed 
our december  net loss applicable to common stockholders includes a similar accretion charge of million 
upon the completion of our initial public offering  the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of common stock and  accordingly  we did not incur any additional accretion charges 
we currently anticipate that our current available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  execute our operating plans  or acquire complimentary technologies or businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure lines of credit  which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in the first quarter of  we converted an outstanding loan receivable of approximately million and invested cash of approximately million in gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry partner  in exchange for million shares of series d preferred stock valued at per share 
the impact of our investment in gcs on our cash  liquidity and capital resources amounted to million  plus forgone interest income we would have received of approximately  annually 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this investment 
our currently anticipated operating lease and capital lease commitments and unconditional purchase obligations over the next five years and thereafter are as follows in thousands future minimum payments due by period total one year years years years contractual obligations and commercial commitments operating lease commitments capital lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations total industry trends and market conditions in  companies throughout the worldwide telecommunication industry announced slowdowns or delays in the build out of new wireless and wireline infrastructure 
this resulted in lower equipment production volumes by our customers and efforts to lower their component inventory levels 
these actions by our customers have resulted in a slowdown in our shipments and reduced our visibility regarding future sales 
the revenue decline has occurred across our channels  customer categories  products and technologies 
these trends contributed to us taking action that resulted in a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in our recording of million in restructuring charges 
in addition  in the second half of  these trends contributed to us recording provisions for excess inventories of million  charges reducing the value of certain equipment of million and recording a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
if the economic trends described above were to continue or worsen it would likely result in lower sales for our products 
significantly lower sales would likely lead to further provisions for excess inventories and further actions by us to reduce our operating expenses 
these actions could include  but would not be limited to  further reduction of our equipment value  further consolidation of facilities  and a further workforce reduction 
any or all of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and the market price of common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations fas and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
we adopted fas in the third quarter of and the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets excluding those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we adopted the statement effective january  and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which supersedes fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of fas is to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in fas for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and to address significant implementation issues 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
we are evaluating the impact of fas on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  our sales have been made to predominantly us based customers and distributors in us dollars 
as a result  we have not had any material exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  we continue to and expect in future periods to expand selling into foreign markets  including europe and asia 
because our sales are denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of bank deposits  commercial paper  federal agency and related securities and money market funds issued or managed by large financial institutions in the united states and canada 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
for example  a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest income by approximately
