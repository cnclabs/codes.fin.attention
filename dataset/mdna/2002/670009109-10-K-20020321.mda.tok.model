item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
general from its inception in through  noven engaged primarily in the development of advanced transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery systems 
during this period  noven s revenues consisted primarily of amounts paid to noven under license agreements with novartis and aventis 
beginning in  when noven s first generation transdermal estrogen delivery system received initial regulatory approvals  noven derived a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of its products to its licensees  novartis and aventis 
in may  noven and novartis formed novogyne to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
novogyne markets vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch in the united states 
novogyne is managed by a committee consisting of five members  three of which are appointed by novartis and two of which are appointed by noven 
pursuant to the joint venture operating agreement  certain significant actions require a supermajority vote of the committee members 
the president of novogyne is robert c 
strauss  who also serves as president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of noven 
the establishment of novogyne modified a prior relationship in which noven had licensed to novartis the exclusive right to market vivelle in the united states and canada and had received royalties from novartis based upon novartis sales 
noven initially invested million in return for a equity interest in novogyne 
novartis contributed its rights to vivelle to novogyne and also licensed to novogyne the right to use the vivelle trademark in return for a equity interest in novogyne 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  noven manufactures and supplies novogyne with vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch  performs marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receives royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of certain of the products 
novartis distributes vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne  including marketing to the managed care sector 
the joint venture agreements provide for an annual preferred return of million to novartis and then an allocation of income between novartis and noven according to a contractual formula depending upon sales levels attained 
novogyne s management committee has the authority to distribute cash to novartis and noven based upon a contractual formula 
noven s share of income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
novogyne s income resulted in the recognition by noven of million  million and million in income in  and  respectively 
in  and  noven received million  million and million in distributions from novogyne based upon novogyne s results of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all of noven s distributions from novogyne plus an additional million were reinvested in novogyne to fund noven s portion of the combipatch license transaction 
noven expects that a significant portion of its earnings and cash flow for the next several years will be generated through its interest in 
table of contents novogyne  but no assurance can be given regarding novogyne s future profitability or cash distributions 
see note of noven s audited financial statements herein for a summary of novogyne s audited financial statements 
novogyne acquired the exclusive united states marketing rights to combipatch in march in a series of transactions involving novogyne  noven  novartis and aventis 
prior to the transaction  aventis had been noven s exclusive licensee for combipatch in the united states 
the transaction was structured as a a direct purchase by novogyne from aventis of certain assets for million  which was paid at closing  b a grant back by aventis to noven of certain intellectual property rights relating to combipatch  and c a simultaneous license by noven to novogyne of these intellectual property rights 
the consideration payable by noven to aventis  and by novogyne to noven  was million  which was due in four quarterly installments of million each with the final payment in march as a consequence of the transaction and under the terms of noven s existing license agreement with aventis  noven received million from aventis  which amount was deferred and recognized as license revenue over ten years beginning in the first quarter of since the relaunch of combipatch by novogyne in may  combipatch total prescriptions have not increased meaningfully 
if novogyne is unable to grow combipatch prescriptions  novogyne s growth may slow and its contribution to noven s earnings and cash flow may be limited 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions could have a material adverse effect on noven s results of operations or financial condition 
marketing rights outside of the united states and canada for both noven s first generation transdermal estrogen delivery system marketed as menorest and noven s transdermal combination estrogen progestin delivery system marketed as estalis were held exclusively by aventis until october  when novartis ag sublicensed aventis rights to market these products in all of aventis exclusive markets other than japan 
in connection with the transaction noven received million in cash from aventis as noven s share of the sublicense fee paid to aventis 
this amount was recorded as deferred license revenue and is being recognized as license revenue over seven and one half years beginning in the fourth quarter of novartis ag is selling menorest in over foreign countries  including france  germany and the united kingdom  and is selling estalis in a number of countries 
estalis is only approved in one dosage strength in most european countries 
while novartis ag has advised noven that it intends to seek approval for a second dosage strength  no assurance can be given that novartis ag will seek such approval or will be successful  and no assurance can be given as to the timing of any such approval or launch in any given country 
noven expects that growth in estalis sales outside of the united states will be limited unless and until a second dosage strength is approved and launched 
in a transaction related to novogyne s acquisition of united states marketing rights to combipatch  novartis ag acquired from aventis the development and marketing rights to future generations of noven s combination estrogen progestin patch in all markets other than japan  and novogyne expects to sublicense the united states rights to these product improvements from novartis ag 
if and when any future generation combination products are commercialized and sublicensed to novogyne  novogyne will pay a royalty to novartis ag on the united states sales of such products 
noven manufactures and supplies combipatch  and expects to manufacture and supply any future combination products to novogyne and to novartis ag 

table of contents in november  noven entered into an exclusive license agreement with novartis ag pursuant to which noven granted novartis ag the right to market vivelle dot under the name estradot in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan 
the agreement also grants novartis ag marketing rights in the same territories to any product improvements and future generations of estrogen patches developed by noven 
noven received an up front license payment of million upon execution of the agreement 
for accounting purposes  the up front payment has been deferred and is being recognized as license revenue over years beginning in the fourth quarter of under the terms of the agreement  novartis ag is responsible for seeking approval to market estradot in its territory 
in march  estradot was approved for marketing in the netherlands 
in november  estradot successfully completed the european mutual recognition procedure 
the product has since been approved for marketing in certain other european countries and the regulatory authorities of other countries are reviewing novartis registration applications 
the agreement provides that receipt of regulatory approval in one of several specified countries triggers a million milestone payment to noven 
noven received the million payment in the fourth quarter of even though the applicable regulatory approvals had not been obtained 
this milestone payment has been deferred and will be recognized as license revenue over the same period as the up front payment  beginning in the quarter when an applicable approval is obtained 
there can be no assurance that novartis ag will be successful in effecting additional registrations of estradot 
novartis markets several other estrogen patches in addition to noven s products 
the growth of estradot sales will depend  in part  on novartis willingness and ability to convert sales of its existing patches to estradot 
there can be no assurance that novartis will choose to actively convert sales of its existing patches to estradot 
noven is developing a once daily transdermal methylphenidate delivery system called methypatch for the treatment of adhd 
in march  noven learned that its first large scale phase iii trial for this product was inconclusive 
this result caused a delay of at least one year in the commercialization of this product and resulted in additional research and development expenses in and noven is now engaged in a second phase iii clinical trial for methypatch  which is expected to be completed and evaluated in the first half of if the phase iii trial is successful  noven would expect to file an nda with the fda thereafter 
if noven s methypatch nda is approved  noven intends to establish its own sales force to market the product 
in such event  noven would expect that its sales and marketing expenses would increase as it prepares for the expected commercialization of the product 
no assurance can be given that the results of the pending phase iii trial will support an nda filing  that noven will be able to successfully complete and file the nda in a timely manner  that the product will be approved by the fda or that  if approved  it will be successfully marketed 
noven expects that revenues from product sales to its licensees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon various factors not in noven s control  including  but not limited to  the marketing efforts of each licensee  the inventory requirements of each licensee  the impact of competitive products  the timing and scope of estalis and estradot launches and commercialization efforts by novartis ag  the growth  if any  in combipatch prescriptions in the united states  the product pricing of each licensee and the timing of certain royalty reconciliations and payments under noven s license agreements 
noven s earnings may fluctuate because of  among other things  fluctuations in research and development spending resulting from the timing of clinical trials involving products in development 
other factors that could impact noven s revenues or earnings are discussed under cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results herein 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands percentage percentage change change product sales license revenue total revenue gross profit product sales less cost of products sold gross margin as a percentage of sales the million  or  increase in revenues versus revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in license revenue  which related to the license of estradot to novartis ag in the fourth quarter of and the license of combipatch to novogyne in the first quarter of product sales were slightly higher in as a result of higher sales of combipatch in the united states and  to a lesser extent  higher sales of estalis outside of the united states  partially offset by a decline in sales of vivelle and vivelle dot to novogyne due to planned inventory reductions at novogyne 
the million  or  increase in revenues versus revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in product sales 
the increase in product sales was primarily a result of sales of estalis  which noven began shipping to novartis ag beginning in the fourth quarter of  and to a lesser extent  higher sales of vivelle and vivelle dot 
vivelle dot was launched by novogyne in may a decline in sales of combipatch in the united states from to partially offset the increased sales of noven s other products 
gross margin noven s gross margin declined to for from in the decrease resulted from unfavorable product mix as noven sold more product outside of the united states where sales have a lower gross margin  while united states sales declined 
the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by higher minimum fee payments from novartis ag 
noven s gross margin declined to for from in the decrease was primarily attributable to novogyne increasing its inventory during in anticipation of an increase in product demand  which caused an increase in the profit that noven was required to defer with respect to product sold to novogyne that remained in novogyne s inventory at december  noven defers the recognition of of its profit from products sold to novogyne until such 
table of contents inventory is sold by novogyne 
see note  description of business vivelle ventures llc  in the notes to financial statements for more information 
in addition  product mix contributed to the decline in gross margin as noven sold more product outside of the united states while united states sales remained generally consistent with the prior year 
operating expenses operating expenses are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands percentage percentage change change research and development marketing  general and administrative research and development the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses versus research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in clinical study expenses for methypatch  partially offset by increases related to additional personnel 
the million  or  increase in research and development expenses versus research and development expenses was primarily attributable to clinical studies and related expenses for methypatch 
marketing  general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses versus marketing  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in outside consulting services related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  consulting costs related to improvements in production efficiencies  reserves for obsolete production equipment and higher legal fees related to the combipatch license transaction 
the increase in expenses was partially offset by a decline in recruitment costs and other related expenses 
the million  or  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses versus marketing  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel  recruitment costs and outside consulting services 

table of contents other income and expenses interest income interest income  net  increased approximately million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to higher average balances in cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by lower interest rates in as compared to the prior year 
interest income  net increased approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily due to higher average balances in cash and cash equivalents due to the receipt of million related to the license of estradot 
income taxes noven s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes is based on the federal and state statutory rates 
realization of the deferred income tax asset of approximately million at december  depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  resulted from the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of million offset by current income tax expense of million 
this was caused by an million reduction of valuation allowance on deferred income tax asset

table of contents novogyne s increase in revenue of million  or  in as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to increased sales of vivelle dot and the addition of combipatch licensed in march  partially offset by a decrease in vivelle sales 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  primarily due to expenses relating to the relaunch of combipatch and to an approximate increase in the size of the novogyne sales force 
novogyne amortized million related to the combipatch acquisition cost during the year ended december  novogyne s increase in revenue of million  or  in as compared to the prior year is attributable to increased sales of vivelle dot  which was launched in the second quarter of novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to higher sales force and promotional expenses due to higher sales 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  noven had million and million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows amounts in thousands cash flows operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of a one time license fee in the amount of million from aventis in connection with the combipatch license transaction and a one time million milestone payment in connection with the estradot license to novartis ag 
see note  license agreements  in the notes to financial statements for more information 
a non cash item equity in earnings of novogyne of million constituted more than of noven s net income of million 
changes in working capital accounted for most of the remaining change over the prior period 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of a one time up front license fee of million in november from novartis ag in connection with the estradot license agreement 
non cash items equity in earnings of novogyne of million and deferred income tax benefit of million constituted of noven s net income of million 
changes in working capital accounted for most of the remaining increase over

changes in working capital accounted for most of the remaining increase 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and a million net investment in novogyne related to the combipatch license transaction 
net cash provided by investing activities during was attributable to million of cash distributions from novogyne  partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets and payment of patent development costs 
net cash used by investing activities in was attributable to the purchase of fixed assets and payment of patent development costs  partially offset by a million cash distribution from novogyne 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in each of  and was attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by payments made on notes payable 
in december  noven entered into a secured revolving credit facility the credit facility providing for borrowings of up to the lesser of million or eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility will terminate in april and bears interest at libor plus at december  
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
terms of the credit facility include  among other things  minimum net worth  revenue and operating results requirements  as well as certain financial ratios  measured on a quarterly basis 
noven s principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under license agreements  distributions from novogyne  and borrowings under its credit facility 
presently  noven s short term liquidity is largely dependent on sales of  and license royalties and fees related to sales of  a relatively small number of products 
as a result  any decrease in the sales of those products by noven or its licensees could have a material adverse effect on noven s short term liquidity or require noven to rely more heavily on its existing cash reserves or on borrowings under its credit facility to support its operations and business 
many factors that could impact sales of noven s products are discussed under cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results herein 
noven believes that it will have sufficient cash available to meet its operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
for the long term  noven intends to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that noven may license or acquire from others 
noven expects that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future licensing arrangements  as well as noven s direct sales of its own products 
noven expects that its cash requirements will continue to increase  primarily to fund clinical studies for products under development and for plant and 
table of contents equipment to expand production capacity 
there can be no assurance that noven will successfully complete the development of such products  that noven will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that noven will successfully negotiate future licensing arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development is incurred prior to product launch  if noven is unable to launch additional commercially viable products that it develops or that it licenses or acquires from others  noven will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely effect noven s long term liquidity needs 
many factors that could impact noven s ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results herein 
to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  noven will seek alternative sources of financing to fund its operations 
in addition to the credit facility which expires in april  alternative financing may be needed to fund further activities 
no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if noven is unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  noven may be required to delay or reduce its proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet its future cash requirements 
see cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results herein for a description of matters that could affect noven s short or long term liquidity 
outlook the principal factors that noven now expects will influence its financial outlook include the timing and magnitude of international product sales to novartis ag  novogyne s ability to increase vivelle family and combipatch sales  costs associated with new clinical studies for products in development  and costs associated with the continued clinical trials of methypatch and related launch preparation 
other factors that could impact noven s financial outlook are discussed under cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results herein 
international product sales sales of noven s international products to novartis ag in the second half of were substantially lower than in the first half of the year 
noven receives firm orders from novartis ag on a partial year basis  which limits noven s ability to accurately forecast full year sales to novartis ag 
based on discussions with novartis ag  noven believes that second half estalis sales were affected by high inventory levels and the lack of a second dosage strength in certain countries 
novartis ag has advised that it plans to seek approval of a second dosage strength in european countries where only one strength is presently approved 
noven expects estalis sales to decline in 
table of contents compared to  and does not expect significant renewed growth in estalis sales unless a second dosage is available in europe and commercialized  which may take several years 
noven received its first orders for estradot in the fourth quarter of  and recorded its first estradot sales in the first quarter of these sales relate to initial estradot launches expected to begin in the second quarter of and to continue through although novartis ag has advised noven that it expects to receive government approvals of estradot in time for planned launches  not all approvals have been received and there is no assurance that those approvals will be received on a timely basis or at all 
failure to receive those approvals on a timely basis could adversely affect novartis ag s launch plans for estradot which would adversely impact noven s estradot sales during vivelle family combipatch prescription growth for the vivelle family of estrogen patches has historically increased from period to period 
at some point the prescription growth of the vivelle family may make further gains by the product line more difficult as a result of market saturation 
in addition  since the relaunch of combipatch by novogyne in may  combipatch monthly total prescriptions have not increased meaningfully 
novogyne has forecast growth in for both combipatch and the vivelle family 
if that growth is not realized  novogyne would not meet its revenue and income targets  which would affect noven s ability to meet its own financial targets for methypatch launch costs noven expects to complete its methypatch phase iii clinical trial and evaluate the resulting data in the first half of if phase iii results support the filing of a methypatch nda  noven would expect to incur sales  marketing and other expenses in in anticipation of a methypatch approval and launch in the second half of these expenses could cause noven s sales and marketing expenses to increase in noven expects that these expenses will increase significantly as launch approaches 
new clinical studies during  noven expects to initiate clinical trials for the development of as many as three new prescription transdermal therapies 
these projects  together with continuing methypatch research and development expenses  are expected to increase noven s research and development expense in the mid range in as compared to a significant portion of the expected ongoing methypatch clinical expenses were incurred during the first quarter of  when the majority of phase iii patients were under clinical study 
the future level of research and development expenditures will depend on  among other things  the status of products under development and the outcome of clinical trials  strategic decisions by management  the consummation of new collaborative arrangements and noven s liquidity 
noven s research and development expenses may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on product development cycles and the timing of clinical studies 
liquidity and capital resources in  noven expects to invest up to million in plant and equipment to increase production capacity 
cash requirements for federal and state income taxes  marketing expenditures related to the launch of methypatch and clinical study expenses are also expected to increase 
table of contents compared to noven expects that it will receive net cash distributions from novogyne in  although no assurances can be given that novogyne s earnings will be sufficient to support distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize them 
full year based on information and forecasts from novartis ag  estradot sales in are not expected to fully offset the anticipated decline in estalis sales  resulting in an international sales decline in if noven s sales targets for the vivelle family and combipatch are achieved 
noven expects that growth in its united states revenues should offset this international decline 
in such a case  noven would expect revenues to increase modestly over and would expect diluted earnings per share to be to 
noven expects gross margin for to be comparable to levels  subject to changes in product and country mix  higher than expected production costs  and unexpected changes in novogyne s inventory 
novogyne s revenues are expected to increase to in compared to  depending upon  among other things  the success of combipatch 
noven expects its equity in earnings of novogyne to increase in compared to the prior year  and expects its effective income tax rate for to be to 
cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about noven s and its strategic partners respective plans  objectives  expectations  estimates  strategies  product approvals and development plans  and anticipated financial results 
these statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  could  should  will  would and similar words 
these statements are based on noven s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events but are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting noven s operations  results of operations  markets  products  prices and prospects  and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the other documents filed by noven with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these factors may cause noven s results to differ materially from the statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of noven 
the following is a brief summary of some of the risk factors  which are not listed in order of priority  that could adversely affect noven s results 
most of these factors are described elsewhere in this report  but the risks described below are not the only risks noven faces 
noven does not undertake to update any of these forward looking statements or to announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements except as required by law 
noven faces competition from a number of companies in the development of transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery products  and competition is expected to intensify as more companies enter the field 
some of these companies are substantially larger than noven and have greater financial and research and development resources than noven  as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
as a result  they may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approvals for products before us 
noven s products compete with other transdermal products as well as alternative 
table of contents dosage forms of the same or comparable chemical entities 
there can be no assurance that noven s products will successfully compete against competitive products or that developments by others will not render noven s products obsolete or uncompetitive 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors or their own internally developed technologies 
noven s equity in earnings of novogyne contributed of noven s income before taxes in  and novogyne s results will likely continue to be material to noven in the future 
because  among other things  noven and novartis are vastly different in size  and because novartis sells competing products outside of novogyne  the interests of noven and novartis may not always be aligned 
this may result in potential conflicts between noven and novartis on matters relating to novogyne which we may not be able to resolve on favorable terms 
novartis has the right to dissolve novogyne under certain circumstances 
novogyne s management committee is comprised of a majority of representatives from novartis 
in addition  the joint venture operating agreement has a buy sell provision which allows either party to compel either the purchase of the other party s interest in novogyne or the sale of its own interest at a price set by the party triggering the buy sell provision 
novartis is a larger company with greater financial resources than noven  and therefore may be in a better position to be the purchaser if the provision is triggered 
if the provision is triggered and novartis is the purchaser  there can be no assurance that noven would be able to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in a manner that would result in sufficient earnings to offset the loss of earnings from novogyne 
if the provision is triggered and noven is the purchaser  there can be no assurance that noven would not be adversely affected by the changes in capital and or debt structure that would likely be required to finance the purchase transaction 
noven expects to be dependent on sales to novartis ag and novogyne  as well as fees and royalties generated from such parties sales of its transdermal delivery systems  for a significant portion of its expected revenues for at least the next several years  and no assurance can be given regarding the amount and timing of such revenues 
failure of any of these parties to market noven s products successfully would cause the quantity of products purchased from noven and the amount of fees and royalties ultimately paid to noven to be reduced and would therefore have a material adverse effect on noven s business and operations 
in the short term  noven s growth depends in part on novartis ag s launch plans and marketing efforts with respect to estalis and estradot  and the scope and success of those efforts are outside the control of noven 
noven receives firm orders from novartis ag on a partial year basis which limits noven s ability to accurately forecast full year sales to novartis ag 
novartis and its affiliates sell competing products  both in the united states and abroad  and there can be no assurance that novartis will promote noven s products at the expense of its other products or that the present supply agreement for vivelle and vivelle dot will be extended 
due to noven s dependence on novogyne and novartis ag  we may be unable to negotiate favorable business terms with them or resolve any dispute that we may be involved in with them in a favorable manner 
noven s pharmaceutical company partners market and sell many of the products noven develops and manufactures 
if one or more of those partners fails to pursue the marketing of noven s products as planned  or if marketing of any of those products including estradot or a second dosage strength of estalis is otherwise delayed  noven s revenues and gross profits may be 
table of contents adversely affected which may also adversely affect noven s short term liquidity 
noven cannot control the timing and other aspects of the development and launch of products incorporating its technologies and marketed by others because noven s partners may have different priorities from noven s 
even if our marketing partners aggressively pursue the launch and marketing of our products  regulatory matters or other external factors may prevent or delay the launch and marketing of our products 
therefore  the commercialization and marketing of products noven has under development may be delayed unexpectedly 
although noven intends to establish an in house sales force for certain of its products under development  including methypatch  noven s principal commercialized products are principally marketed and sold by novogyne and novartis  and noven does not presently have a significant direct marketing channel to consumers for its drug delivery technologies 
the marketing organizations of our partners may be unsuccessful  or those partners may assign a lower level of priority to the marketing of our products 
if marketing efforts for noven s products are not successful  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected  which may also adversely affect noven s short term liquidity 
noven s long term strategy is dependent  in part  upon the successful development  licensing or acquisition of new products  such as methypatch  and their successful commercialization 
there can be no assurance that noven will be able to identify promising products or technologies 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities may be considerable 
no assurance can be given that noven will have the financial resources necessary to complete products under development  that those projects to which noven dedicates sufficient resources will be successfully completed  that noven will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such product  or that any approved product can be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  either by noven or by a licensing partner 
a project can fail or be delayed at any stage of development  even if each prior stage was completed successfully  which could adversely impact noven s ability to recover its investment in the product 
some of noven s development projects will not be completed successfully or on schedule 
many of the factors which may cause a product in development to fail or be delayed  such as difficulty in enrolling patients in clinical trials  the failure of clinical trials  lack of sufficient supplies or raw materials  inability to apply the subject product or technology on a commercial scale on an economical basis and changes in regulations  are beyond noven s control 
in some cases  noven has begun and  in the future  may begin development of a product that it does not intend to independently develop through clinical trials and market  with the expectation that a licensee will be identified to assist in development and or marketing 
there can be no assurance that noven will attract a business partner for any particular product or will be able to negotiate an agreement on commercially reasonable terms 
if an agreement is not reached  noven s initial development investment in any such product may not be recovered 
almost all of noven s revenues are currently generated through sales of its hormone replacement therapy transdermal delivery systems 
while these products have been found to be safe and effective by the fda and the regulatory authorities of those countries where noven s products are approved  published studies have concluded that there may be health risks associated with hormone replacement therapy  including potentially increased risk of endometrial or breast cancer 
evidence that hormone replacement therapy is or could be associated with such risks could adversely affect physician or patient preference for addressing the indications hormone replacement therapy is intended to address  which could adversely affect the ability of noven to market its products 

table of contents noven depends upon collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies to obtain regulatory approval for  market and sell certain of its products 
additionally  noven intends to seek developmental partners to develop  test and obtain regulatory approval for  and commercialize certain of its products presently under development 
the number of noven s products that are successfully developed and commercialized will affect noven s revenues 
if noven does not enter into additional agreements in the future  or if our current or future agreements do not result in successful marketing of noven s products  its revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
noven s operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries with respect to the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting regulations  product promotion  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practices  and product changes or modifications 
noven s facilities handle controlled substances  resulting in additional extensive regulatory requirements and oversight 
noven devotes significant time  effort and expense addressing the extensive government regulations applicable to its business 
even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority  product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product 
failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in fines  warning letters  unanticipated compliance expenditures  interruptions or suspension of production and resulting loss of sales  product seizures or recalls  injunctions prohibiting further sales  withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications  and criminal prosecution 
marketing claims are the basis for a product s labeling  advertising and promotion 
after fda approval of a product incorporating noven s technologies  the division of drug marketing  advertising and communication  must approve marketing claims asserted about that product 
if approval of acceptable marketing claims is not obtained for any of noven s products  revenues derived from that product may be limited 
there can be no assurance that our marketing partners will comply with the foregoing restrictions with respect to claims that they may assert about our technology or products 
noven s supply agreements with its licensees also impose strict obligations on noven with respect to the manufacture and supply of noven s products 
noven devotes significant time  effort and expense complying with these requirements 
failure to comply with the terms of these supply agreements may result in noven being unable to supply product to its licensees  resulting in lost revenue by noven and potential responsibility for damages and losses suffered by its licensees 
the federal and state governments in the united states  as well as many foreign governments  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform 
in the united states  these proposals include government programs involving prescription drug reimbursement benefits for seniors 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth from country to country and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  noven cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical industry or on the business or operating results of noven 

table of contents substantially all of noven s revenues are generated through sales of transdermal delivery systems 
noven s products are marketed primarily to physicians  some of whom are reluctant to prescribe a transdermal delivery system when an alternative delivery system is available 
noven and its licensees must demonstrate to prescribing physicians the benefits of transdermal delivery  especially with respect to products such as methypatch for which there is presently no transdermal system on the market 
the commercial success of noven s products is also based in part on patient preference  and difficulties in obtaining patient acceptance of noven s transdermal or transmucosal delivery systems may similarly impact noven s ability to market its products 
noven s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain or license patents for its products  processes and technologies 
if noven does not do so  its competitors may exploit noven s innovations and deprive noven of the ability to realize revenues from those innovations 
there is no assurance that noven will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products 
additionally  there can be no assurance that noven s patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products  or challenging  invalidating or avoiding noven s patent applications or any existing or future patents that noven receives or licenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that any of noven s future processes or products will be patentable  that any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions or that noven s processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties 
noven also relies on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation 
noven uses confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants to protect its trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation  but there can be no assurance that these parties will not breach their agreements with us 
noven also cannot be certain that it will have adequate remedies for any breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  noven cannot be sure that its trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or that noven s competitors will not independently develop noven s trade secrets and proprietary technology 
noven also cannot be sure  if it does not receive patents for products arising from its research  that it will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to its products 
noven s success will also depend in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and there can be no assurance that noven s products and processes will not infringe upon the patents of others 
if a third party asserts a claim of infringement  noven may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those third party patents in court 
if noven cannot obtain the required licenses  or is found liable for infringement or is not able to have these patents declared invalid  noven may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by the patents of others 
there can be no assurance that noven has identified  or that in the future it will be able to identify  all us and foreign patents that may pose a risk of potential infringement claims 

table of contents like all pharmaceutical companies  the testing  manufacturing and marketing of noven s products may expose noven to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
if any such claims against noven are successful  noven may be required to make significant compensation payments and suffer the associated adverse publicity 
noven maintains product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that its insurance will cover all future claims or that noven will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
if a claim is not covered or if noven s coverage is insufficient  noven may incur significant liability payments that would negatively affect our earnings and our business 
certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of noven s products are available from limited sources  and  in some cases  a single source 
any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could be accompanied by production or other delays  and  in the case of products for which only one raw material supplier exists  could result in a material loss of sales 
additionally  regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products 
without adequate approved supplies of raw materials or packaging supplies  noven s manufacturing operations may be interrupted until another supplier could be identified  its products approved and trading terms with it negotiated 
noven may not be able to identify an alternative supplier and any supplier that noven does identify may not be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  noven may not be able to negotiate favorable terms with an alternative supplier 
any disruptions in noven s manufacturing operations from the loss of an approved supplier may cause noven to incur increased costs and lose revenues and may have an adverse effect on noven s relationships with its partners and customers  any of which could have adverse effects on noven s business and results of operations 
all of noven s products are manufactured at a single facility located in miami  florida 
an interruption of manufacturing operations resulting from regulatory issues  technical problems  casualty loss including hurricane or other factors could result in noven s inability to meet production requirements  which may cause noven to lose revenues and which could have an adverse effect on noven s relationships with its partners and customers any of which could have a material adverse effect on noven s business and financial results 
without noven s existing production facility  noven would have no other means of manufacturing its products until it was able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although noven carries business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues and profits  this insurance does not cover all possible situations and there can be no assurance that any event of casualty to our facility would be covered by such insurance 
in addition  noven s business interruption insurance would not compensate it for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing partners and customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
if noven successfully completes clinical trials and files an nda for its methypatch product  noven expects to establish a sales force to sell methypatch in the united states rather than grant exclusive marketing rights to a third party 
establishing a sales force  and expanding noven s 
table of contents sales  marketing and business infrastructure to support the sales force  would require the expenditure of substantial funds 
there can be no assurance that  if methypatch is approved for marketing by the fda  noven will generate sufficient sales of the product to cover the ongoing expense of noven s sales and marketing organization and or to realize adequate profits 
in addition  some of these expenses may be incurred prior to receipt of marketing approval 
in the event that methypatch is not approved for marketing  these expenses will not be recovered 
additionally  any delays in organizing a sales force for methypatch could have an adverse impact on noven s ability to market the product and realize profits from sales of the product 
noven has no experience marketing or selling products to the physician group that would prescribe methypatch and therefore has a disadvantage compared to certain of its competitors 
there is an ongoing public debate in the united states regarding the appropriateness of using methylphenidate and other medications to treat children with adhd 
noven expects that this debate will continue for the foreseeable future 
the outcome of this debate is uncertain  and noven cannot predict what impact  if any  the increased public attention will have on the market for products indicated for adhd generally  or on methypatch specifically 
from time to time noven may need to acquire licenses to patents and other intellectual property of third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize its products 
there can be no assurance that noven will be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
the failure to obtain such a license would negatively affect the ability of noven to develop  manufacture and commercialize certain products  and could therefore have an adverse effect on noven s business and financial results 
noven relies on insurance to protect it from many kinds of business risk  including product liability  business interruption  property and casualty loss  employment practices liability and directors and officers liability 
as a result of the events of september   an increase in the number of securities class action suits  an increase in damages and or settlements paid in connection with certain of these class actions  an increase in the number of product liability claims and the resulting damages and settlements  and other factors  noven has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  difficulty in obtaining insurance with adequate coverage at historical rates 
in most cases  as insurance policies expire  noven may be required to procure policies with narrower coverage  more exclusions  and higher premiums 
there can be no assurance that the insurance that noven maintains and intends to maintain will be adequate  or that the cost of insurance and limitations in coverage will not adversely affect noven s business and financial results 
in  noven implemented a new enterprise resource planning system 
noven expects that  over time  the new system will result in improved business processes and increased operating efficiencies 
as noven s employees become familiar with the new system  noven expects that some errors may occur  some of which could adversely impact noven s business and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the system will perform as expected or that the anticipated improvements in business processes and operating efficiencies will be achieved 
in the event of serious system malfunctions or deficiencies  noven could experience business interruptions  which could adversely impact noven s business and financial results 

table of contents in november and december and january  individuals purporting to be shareholders of noven filed a total of five substantially identical lawsuits against noven and certain of its directors and officers in the united states district court for the southern district of florida 
the plaintiffs each seek to act as representatives of a class consisting of all purchasers of noven s common stock between march and november  the plaintiffs each allege that during that period  noven and its officers and directors named as defendants violated sections and of the securities exchange act of and rule b thereunder by making material misstatements and omissions regarding international sales of certain of noven s products that are the subject of an exclusive license agreement with novartis ag 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages  for themselves and the purported class  based on the allegedly artificially inflated prices paid for their shares of noven s common stock 
on march   the court entered an order consolidating all of the captioned actions into a single consolidated action and directing plaintiff s counsel to file a single amended and consolidated complaint 
noven believes that these lawsuits are without merit  and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously  but their outcomes cannot be predicted 
however  an adverse determination to noven in any of such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on noven s financial position and results of operations 
noven s corporate charter documents  delaware law and noven s stockholders rights plan include provisions that may discourage or prevent parties from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of prevailing market prices in an acquisition of noven 
noven s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to bring matters before an annual meetings of stockholders  call special meetings or nominate candidates to serve on noven s board of directors 
noven is also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
noven also has a stockholders rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which is intended to cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire noven on terms that our board of directors has not approved 
the existence of the stockholders rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of noven s common stock without the consent of noven s board of directors 
the market price of noven s common stock was extremely volatile in and may continue to be volatile going forward 
in  noven s common stock traded as low as per share and as 
table of contents high as per share before closing at on december   the last trading day of the year 
any number of factors  including many over which noven has no control and many unrelated to noven s business or financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of noven s common stock  including announcements by noven or its competitors of technological innovations or new commercial products  changes in governmental regulation  receipt by noven or one of its competitors of regulatory approvals  developments relating to patents or proprietary rights of noven or one of its competitors  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results or risks for products that noven or one of its competitors market or has under development  and period to period changes in financial results and the economy generally 
noven  like any other company with a volatile stock price  may be subject to further securities litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on noven s business and financial results 
fluctuations in noven s operating results may lead to fluctuations or declines in its stock price 
noven s operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on demand by its customers for noven s products  new product introductions  pharmaceutical company ordering patterns  the number and timing of product development milestones that noven achieves  and the level of noven s spending on new drug delivery technology development and technology acquisition  and internal product development 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk noven had no variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended or at december  therefore  changes in interest rates did not affect interest expense  earnings or cash flows in market risks relating to noven s operations may result from changes in libor interest rates if noven borrows under its credit facility 
noven cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on any variable rate debt that noven may have outstanding from time to time  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available at favorable rates  if at all
