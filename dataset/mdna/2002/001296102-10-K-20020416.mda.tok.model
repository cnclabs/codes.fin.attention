these proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
credit facility we obtain our working capital from borrowings pursuant to a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks 
wachovia bank  national association is the administrative agent for the lenders 
our borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our operating subsidiaries 
at december   we were not in compliance with a number of the covenants under the credit facility 
on april   we reached agreement with our banks to amend the facility 
the amendment eliminated the default  extended the maturity of the credit facility from april  to january   reduced the amount we are permitted to borrow  increased the interest rates that we are required to pay and modified our financial covenants 
under the amended agreement  at april   we were permitted to borrow up to million 
the amount that we are permitted to borrow decreases incrementally each month to approximately million as of december  under the credit facility  we are required to satisfy covenants relating to minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures  among others 
we have monthly targets for each financial covenant that we must meet 
if we fail to comply with the covenants  we will be in default 
upon the occurrence of a default  unless our lenders grant a further waiver  we will not be permitted to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility  and the outstanding amounts will become immediately due and payable 
as required by our amended credit facility  we have retained an investment banking firm and are diligently pursuing opportunities for raising cash through the sale of debt or equity securities 
any proceeds from the sale of such securities will be used to reduce the outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
as previously announced  we are diligently pursuing the sale of our german specialized staffing business 
management believes that the company will be able to dispose of the business in the upcoming months 
the net cash proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce the outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
even if we are successful in completing the sale of our german business and close on the sale of debt or equity securities in the upcoming months  we may not be able to fully repay the amounts outstanding under the credit facility  and we may be required to obtain additional cash pursuant to a replacement senior secured credit facility 
we are in preliminary discussions with several lenders about providing the necessary financing 
if we have not repaid the facility in full by september   we are required to pursue other measures to obtain funds sufficient to repay the borrowings  including a business combination transaction 
we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully complete the disposition of our german business  the issuance of debt or equity securities or the refinancing of any amounts that remain outstanding under the credit facility 
we are dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to the credit facility to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and other cash flow requirements 
if borrowings under the credit facility are unavailable  we will be required to seek additional sources of financing in order to fund our working capital needs 
if we are unable to obtain additional sources of financing and cannot repay the outstanding balance of our credit facility when it becomes due  it is likely that a business combination transaction  restructuring or liquidation will be required in whole or in part 
our ability to achieve these tasks is subject to the performance of our core marketing services business and to other factors 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts we have entered into  including amounts pursuant to the credit facility  equipment notes and non cancelable operating lease agreements 
future contractual obligations related to these items at december  are as follows less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands credit facility    equipment notes operating leases      critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources fulfillment operations and the delivery of business services 
our fulfillment services operations record revenue at the conclusion of the material selection  packaging and shipping process 
unbilled revenue is recorded in certain situations when the materials have been shipped  but invoicing did not occur until the subsequent accounting period 
work in process consists of labor and material costs for fulfillment programs and merchandising support services provided to customers that have not been completed 
work in process is not included in revenue at the end of an accounting period 
our customer services businesses recognize revenue according to written pricing agreements based on the number of calls  agents assigned or in store visits 
the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition practices 
management believes that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
during the year ended december   we had one customer that accounted for greater than of revenues from continuing operations 
during and  there were no individual customers that accounted for more than of our revenues from continuing operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
self insurance and other reserves we participate in partially self insured  high deductible workers compensation and auto insurance plans 
exposure is limited per occurrence  for workers compensation and auto liability claims and in the aggregate 
in addition  we are partially self insured for health claims for certain us employees 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for workers compensation  auto and health insurance is dependent on certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  projected claims and the rate of increase in compensation and health care costs 
revisions to estimated reserves are recorded in the periods in which they become known 
while there can be no assurance that actual future claims will not exceed the amount of our reserves  in the opinion of our management  any future adjustments to estimated reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the strategic review of operations performed during  we recorded additional reserves for various items  including costs of buying out unattractive or redundant leases  severance costs incurred in conjunction with the closing of the atlanta corporate offices  legal and other expenses related to the abandoned pimms operation  and other related items 
significant management judgment was required in determining the amount of these reserves  and while there can be no assurance that future costs will not exceed the amount of our reserves  in the opinion of our management  any future adjustments to estimated reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangibles 
at december   we had million in net intangible assets  accounting for approximately of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in july  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  this change in accounting will increase net income by approximately million or per share because goodwill will no longer be amortized 
the standard also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and a test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we do not anticipate recording any related impairment losses 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on operating results 
discontinued operations our financial statements were prepared using discontinued operations accounting for the discontinued aviation and facility services and specialized staffing services businesses 
under discontinued operations accounting  we accrued estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge  which  in many cases  was expected to be several years in the future 
at december   million was recorded as the total liability remaining for the final settlement on the sale of the aviation and facility services businesses  in accordance with the settlement agreement effective april  management believes this amount accurately reflects the obligation due from this sale  and does not anticipate further charges for this business 
on march   we sold our united kingdom specialized staffing services business  and based upon the transaction consideration  recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to reduce the net assets of the uk business to their realizable value 
we are in the process of divesting the german specialized staffing services business 
based on current negotiations  and concurrent with the million charge taken in the fourth quarter of for the uk business  we recorded an additional charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill on the german business 
although management anticipates the divestiture to be completed in  there can be no assurance that additional charges will not be incurred in the eventual sale of the business 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

we have entered into an amended credit facility under which we must satisfy certain financial and other covenants 
on april   we reached agreement with our banks to amend our credit facility 
among other things  the amendment eliminated the default under our previous agreement  extended the maturity date to january   reduced the amount we are permitted to borrow and modified our financial covenants 
under the amended agreement  at april   we were permitted to borrow up to million 
the amount that we are permitted to borrow decreases incrementally each month to approximately million as of december  although we have amended our credit facility and reduced our indebtedness from the amount that was outstanding at december   we still have substantial indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could have negative consequences for our business  including the following limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to debt service  limiting our flexibility in reacting to changes in our industry and changes in market conditions  increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business  and increasing our interest expense due to increases in prevailing interest rates  because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
under the amended credit facility  we are required to satisfy covenants relating to minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures  among others 
we have monthly targets for each financial covenant that we must meet 
if we fail to comply with the covenants  we will be in default 
upon the occurrence of a default  unless our lenders grant a further waiver  we will not be permitted to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility  and the outstanding amounts will become immediately due and payable 
our borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our operating subsidiaries 
as required by our amended credit facility  we have retained an investment banking firm and are diligently pursuing opportunities for raising cash through the sale of debt or equity securities 
we also are diligently pursuing the sale of our german specialized staffing business 
the net cash proceeds received from these activities will be used to reduce the outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
even if we are successful in completing the sale of our german business and close on the sale of debt or equity securities in the upcoming months  we may not be able to fully repay the amounts outstanding under the credit facility  and we may be required to obtain additional cash pursuant to a replacement senior secured credit facility 
we are in preliminary discussions with several lenders about providing the necessary financing 
if we have not repaid the facility in full by september   we are required to pursue other measures to obtain funds sufficient to repay the borrowings  including a business combination transaction 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete the disposition of our german business  the issuance of debt or equity securities or the refinancing of any amounts that remain outstanding under the credit facility 
we are dependent on the availability of borrowings pursuant to the credit facility to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and other cash flow requirements 
if borrowings under the credit facility are unavailable  we will be required to seek additional sources of financing in order to fund our working capital needs 
if we are unable to obtain additional sources of financing and cannot repay the outstanding balance of our credit facility when it becomes due  it is likely that a business combination transaction  restructuring or liquidation will be required in whole or in part 
we have not completed the sale of our german staffing business 
we are in negotiations with several interested parties with respect to the sale of our german staffing business 
we expect to use the proceeds of the sale to repay a portion of our credit facility 
we cannot guarantee the timing of when we will complete the sale of the business or the amount of proceeds we will receive from the sale 
we may not be able to finance our growth strategy 
even if we complete the sale of our german staffing business  we will not be able to repay the entire credit facility  and our ability to grow will be limited 
we have publicly announced our intention to issue debt or equity securities to investors  with the proceeds being used to repay the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell debt or equity securities on terms that are acceptable to management or at all 
in the event that we are unsuccessful at raising additional capital  we may be required to consider a restructuring  business combination transactions or liquidation 
we have experienced net losses 
we incurred net losses from continuing operations of million for fiscal we have had net losses from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of and all four quarters in in addition  we anticipate that we will have a net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of we cannot assure you that losses will not continue in the future 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  our success in implementing our business strategies  announcements of new contracts or contract cancellations  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies  and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
since only a relatively small portion of our outstanding common stock is currently available for trading without restriction under rule  and since our stock often trades at a relatively low volume level  any change in demand for our stock can be expected to substantially influence the market prices for our common stock 
the price of our stock varied from a high of to a low of during we depend on our labor force 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to recruit  hire  train and retain qualified employees 
our business is labor intensive and continues to experience relatively high personnel turnover 
our operations generally require specially trained employees 
increases in our employee turnover rate could increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
the addition of new clients or implementation of new projects for existing clients may require us to recruit  hire and train personnel at accelerated rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit  hire  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff for existing business or future growth 
additionally  since a substantial portion of our operating expenses consist of labor related costs  continued labor shortages together with increases in wages including minimum wages as mandated by the us federal government  employee benefit costs  employment tax rates  and other labor related expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating profit and financial condition 
furthermore  certain of our facilities are located in areas with relatively low unemployment rates  thus potentially making it more difficult and costly to hire qualified personnel 
we depend on key management personnel that have only recently joined ahl 
we have recently had a change in some of our key management positions  including a new chief executive officer in october and a new chief financial officer in april we also depend in large part on the abilities and continuing efforts of the officers and senior management within our marketing services business 
our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected if our new management team is not able to effectively manage our operations or if current officers and managers do not continue in their key roles 
in order to support growth  we must effectively recruit  develop and retain additional qualified management personnel 
we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to recruit and retain additional qualified managers 
we are controlled by our principal shareholders 
as of march   frank a 
argenbright  jr  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  and edwin c 
skip gage  one of our directors  owns approximately of our stock 
as a group  our executive officers and directors own approximately of our stock 
as a result  messrs 
argenbright  gage and our executive officers and directors are able to control substantially all matters requiring action by our shareholders 
our business relies on the trend toward outsourcing 
we believe there has recently been a significant increase in businesses outsourcing services not directly related to their principal business activities 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the outsourcing trend declines or reverses  or if corporations bring previously outsourced functions back in house 
particularly during general economic downturns  businesses may bring previously outsourced functions in house in order to avoid or delay layoffs 
we rely on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenues 
we focus on developing long term relationships with large corporations and institutions 
in  our ten largest clients accounted for approximately of our marketing services revenues 
our success depends substantially upon retaining our significant clients 
we may lose clients due to a merger or acquisition  business failure  contract expiration  conversion to a competitor or conversion to an in house system 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain long term relationships or secure renewals of short term relationships with our significant clients in the future 
if we lose one or more of our largest clients  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we do not have long term contracts with many of our clients 
though we have written agreements with many of our clients  we do not have written agreements with some of our major clients 
we currently provide services to those clients pursuant to oral agreements 
the written agreements that we have are generally terminable for cause and can often be terminated without cause on short notice 
many of our agreements do not assure specific volume or revenue levels 
in addition  our contracts generally do not provide that we will be the client s exclusive service provider 
we depend on certain client industries 
we derive our revenue primarily from the automotive  consumer products  entertainment and retail industries 
fundamental changes in the business practices of any of these client industries  whether due to regulatory  technological  or other developments  could cause a material reduction in demand by our clients for the services offered by us 
any reduction in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in revenues and operating results as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including timing of existing and future client product launches or service offerings  expiration or termination of client projects  timing and amount of costs incurred to expand capacity in order to provide for further revenue growth from existing and future clients  seasonal nature of certain clients businesses  and changes in the amount and growth rate of revenues generated from our principal clients 
we may not be able to keep pace with changing technology 
the markets for our business process outsourcing services are subject to rapid technological changes and rapid changes in client requirements 
this trend could adversely affect our business and financial results and result in the loss of clients and our ability to attract clients 
while our global enterprise management proprietary system is one of the most advanced in the industry  we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop more sophisticated or cost effective systems 
we cannot assure you that we will select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to meet our clients needs and maintain competitiveness 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in customizing products and services that incorporate new technology on a timely basis 
our failure to successfully and timely implement sophisticated technology or to respond effectively to technological changes would have a material adverse effect on our success  growth prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we face competition in our industry 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
management expects competition to persist in the future 
our competitors include small firms offering specific applications  divisions of large companies  large independent firms and in house operations of our existing and potential clients 
a number of competitors have or may develop financial and other resources greater than ours 
similarly  there can be no assurance additional competitors with greater name recognition and resources than us will not enter the markets in which we operate 
our performance and growth could be materially and adversely affected if our clients decide to retain in house the services they currently outsource  or if potential clients retain or increase their in house capabilities 
a decision by our large clients to consolidate their outsourced services with a company other than ours would materially and adversely affect our business 
competitive pressures from current or future competitors could result in substantial price erosion  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may suffer losses from business interruptions 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our facilities  clients products  confidential client information  computer equipment  telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage from internet interruption  fire  power loss  telecommunications interruption  e commerce interruption  natural disaster  theft  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses and other emergencies 
while we maintain certain procedures and contingency plans to minimize the detrimental impact of such events  there can be no assurance such procedures and plans will be successful 
in the event we experience temporary or permanent interruptions or other emergencies at one or more of our facilities that cause interruptions in our ability to meet our clients requirements  it could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share 
while we maintain property and business interruption insurance  it may not adequately and or timely compensate us for all losses we may incur 
further  some of our operations require timely and consistent access to telephone  internet  e commerce  e mail  facsimile connections and other forms of communication hours per day  seven days per week 
we are substantially dependent upon telephone companies  internet service providers and various telecommunications infrastructure to provide these forms of communication 
if such communications are interrupted on a short or long term basis  our services would be similarly interrupted and delayed 
we also rely on third party carriers including united parcel service  inc and the united states postal service to ship and mail products from our distribution facility to purchasers 
if our shippers experience interruptions from labor strikes or other events  our ability to distribute products could be impaired 
we face risks associated with general economic conditions 
we operate within us and international economies which are subject to various economic  market and other factors 
we  as well as our clients  can be vulnerable to recession or other significant economic events or downturn 
the us economy and related financial markets have generally experienced downward fluctuations in the past twelve months 
economic instability or continued downturn may continue for the foreseeable future 
these broad economic factors can adversely affect our revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our discontinued operations for include the european specialized staffing business 
discontinued operations in and include the divested us and european aviation and facility services businesses and the us and european specialized staffing services businesses 
revenues included in discontinued operations are received  and operating costs are incurred  in foreign currencies primarily the british pound and the euro german mark 
the denomination of foreign subsidiaries account balances in their local currency exposes us to certain foreign exchange rate risks 
we address the exposure by financing most working capital needs in the applicable foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we maintain a credit facility which subjects us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
our credit facility had a balance outstanding at december   of million  which was at a variable rate of interest 
we have historically maintained an interest rate swap agreement in an effort to hedge against increasing interest rates 
the interest rate swap agreement expired november  this agreement was effective november   and was in the notional amount of euro million at a fixed rate of plus the applicable margin 
it replaced the three year swap agreement effective may   at a notional amount of approximately million  and the january  additional interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of approximately million
