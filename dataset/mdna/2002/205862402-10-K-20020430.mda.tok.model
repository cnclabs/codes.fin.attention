item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for sales of systems which do not require significant customization to be performed by the company and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by the company 
the company s systems are generally a bundled hardware and software solution that are shipped together 
the company generally has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped  except for product warranties 
the company generally warranties its products for one year after sale 
a provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale 
customers may also purchase separate maintenance contracts  which generally consist of bug fixing and telephone access to company technical personnel  but in certain circumstances may also include the right to receive unspecified product updates  upgrades and enhancements 
revenue from these services is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenues from certain development contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method on the basis of physical completion to date or using actual costs incurred to total expected costs under the contract 
revisions in estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
at the time a loss on a contract is known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is accrued 
amounts received from customers in excess of revenues earned under the percentage of completion method are recorded as advance payments from customers 
accounts receivable are generally diversified due to the number of commercial and government entities comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across many geographical regions 
at the end of each accounting period  the company records a reserve for bad debts included in accounts receivable based upon its current and historical collection history 
cost of sales include material costs  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the operations and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the operations and service departments  amortization of capitalized software costs  royalties and license fee costs  travel costs and an overhead allocation 
research and development costs include salary and related benefits as well as travel  depreciation and amortization of research and development equipment  an overhead allocation  as well as other costs associated with research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative costs include salary and related benefits  travel  depreciation and amortization  marketing and promotional materials  recruiting expenses  professional fees  facility costs  as well as other costs associated with sales  marketing  finance and administrative departments 
software development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software  which to date has been four years or less 
amortization begins in the period in which the related product is available for general release to customers 
the company reviews for the impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and proceeds from its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
impairment is measured at fair value

pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition are not material 
the company believes that its existing working capital  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide for its planned operations for the foreseeable future 
the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may from time to time issue additional debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated investment 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have not been  and are not anticipated to be  materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the ability of its foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or by withholding taxes associated with any such dividend payments 
certain trends and uncertainties the company derives the majority of its revenue from the telecommunications industry  which is facing an unprecedented recession 
this has resulted in a significant reduction of capital expenditures made by tsps 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been  and will continue to be  adversely affected by the severe decline in technology purchases and capital expenditures by tsps worldwide and by unfavorable global economic conditions 
consequently  the company s operating results have deteriorated significantly in recent periods and may continue to deteriorate in future periods if such conditions remain in effect 
for these reasons and the risk factors outlined below  it has been and continues to be very difficult for the company to accurately forecast future revenues and operating results 
the company s business is particularly dependent on the strength of the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry  in general  and the company  in particular  have been negatively affected by  among other factors  the high costs and large debt positions incurred by some tsps to expand capacity and enable the provision of future services and the corresponding risks associated with the development  marketing and adoption of these services as discussed below  including the cost of acquisitions of licenses to provide future broadband services and reductions in tsps actual and projected revenues and deterioration in their actual and projected operating results 
accordingly  tsps have significantly reduced their actual and planned expenditures to expand or replace equipment and delayed and reduced the deployment of services 
a number of tsps  including certain customers of the company  have indicated the existence of conditions of excess capacity in certain markets 
in addition  tsps have delayed the planned introduction of new services  such as broadband mobile telephone services  that would be supported by certain of the company s products 
certain of the company s customers also have implemented changes in procurement practices and procedures  including limitations on purchases in anticipation of estimated future capacity requirements  and in the management and use of their networks  that have had an adverse affect on the company s sales and order backlog  which also has made it very difficult for the company to project future sales 
the continuation and or exacerbation of these trends will have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
in addition to loss of revenue  weakness in the telecommunications industry has affected and will continue to affect the company s business by increasing the risks of credit or business failures of suppliers  customers or distributors  by customer requirements for vendor financing  by delays and defaults in customer or distributor payments  and by price reductions instituted by competitors to retain or acquire market share 
the company s current plan of operations is predicated in part on a recovery in capital expenditures by its customers 
in the absence of such improvement  the company would experience further deterioration in its operating results  and may determine to modify its plan for future operations accordingly  which may include  among other things  additional reductions in its workforce 
the company intends to continue to make significant investments in its business  and to examine opportunities for growth through acquisitions and strategic investments 
these activities may involve significant expenditures and obligations that cannot readily be curtailed or reduced if anticipated demand for the associated products does not materialize or is delayed 
the impact of these decisions on future financial results cannot be predicated with assurance  and the company s commitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to downturns in its markets  technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions 
the company also may not be able to identify future suitable merger or acquisition candidates  and even if the company does identify suitable candidates  it may not be able to make these transactions on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company does make acquisitions  it may not be able to successfully incorporate the personnel  operations and customers of these companies into the company s business 
in addition  the company may fail to achieve the anticipated synergies from the combined businesses  including marketing  product integration  distribution  product development and other synergies 
the integration process may further strain the company s existing financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures 
this may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the company s core business objectives 
in addition  an acquisition or merger may require the company to utilize cash reserves  incur debt or issue equity securities  which may result in a dilution of existing stockholders  and the company may be negatively impacted by the assumption of liabilities of the merged or acquired company 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  the company may find the value of its acquired technologies and related intangible assets  such as goodwill as recorded in the company s financial statements  to be impaired  resulting in charges to operations 
the company may also fail to retain the acquired or merged companies key employees and customers 
the company has made  and in the future  may continue to make strategic investments in other companies 
these investments have been made in  and future investments will likely be made in  immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies 
such investments have a high degree of risk  with the possibility that the company may lose the total amount of its investments 
the company may not be able to identify suitable investment candidates  and  even if it does  the company may not be able to make those investments on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  even if the company makes investments  it may not gain strategic benefits from those investments 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications market and new alternatives for the delivery of services are having  and can be expected to continue to have  a profound effect on competitive conditions in the market and the success of market participants  including the company 
the company s continued success will depend on its ability to correctly anticipate technological trends in its industries  to react quickly and effectively to such trends and to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
as a result  the life cycle of the company s products is difficult to estimate 
in addition  changing industry and market conditions may dictate strategic decisions to restructure some business units and discontinue others 
discontinuing a business unit or product line may result in the company recording accrued liabilities for special charges  such as costs associated with a reduction in work force 
these strategic decisions could result in changes to determinations regarding a product s useful life and the recoverability of the carrying basis of certain assets 
the company s products involve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future products will not develop operational problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for specific components and may not be able to find alternate manufacturers that meet its requirements and existing or alternative sources may not be available on favorable terms and conditions 
thus  if there is a shortage of supply for these components  the company may experience an interruption in its product supply 
in addition  loss of third party software licensing would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the telecommunications industry continues to undergo significant change as a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide  reducing restrictions on competition in the industry 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment also may have an impact on the company s revenues and or costs in any given part of the world 
the worldwide ess system industry is already highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify 
the company believes that existing competitors will continue to present substantial competition  and that other companies  many with considerably greater financial  marketing and sales resources than the company  may enter the ess system markets 
moreover  as the company enters into new markets as a result of its own research and development efforts or acquisitions  it is likely to encounter new competitors 
the market for the company s digital security and surveillance and enterprise business intelligence products has also been affected by weakness in general economic conditions  delays or reductions in customers purchases of capital equipment and uncertainties relating to government expenditure programs 
budgetary constraints  uncertainties resulting from the introduction of new technologies and shifts in the pattern of government expenditures resulting from increased uncertainties in the market for monitoring systems  resulting in certain instances in the attenuation of government procurement programs beyond their originally expected performance periods and an increased incidence of delay  cancellation or reduction of planned projects 
competitive conditions in this sector have also been affected by the increasing use by certain potential government customers of their own internal development resources rather than outside vendors to provide certain technical solutions 
in addition  a number of established government contractors  particularly developers and integrators of technology products  have taken steps to redirect their marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut backs in their traditional areas of focus  resulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests for proposals 
the lack of predictability in the timing and scope of government procurements have similarly made planning decisions more difficult and have increased the associated risks 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales and operating profit from contracts for large system installations with major customers 
the company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its product development and marketing strategies 
contracts for large installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict 
the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted different strategies  and also may be more volatile than the company has experienced in prior periods 
the degree of dependence by the company on large system orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
the company s gross margins also may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  obsolescence charges  price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect the company s operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and the continued state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip  and more recently israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders 
as a result  negotiations between israel and representatives of the palestinian authority have been sporadic and have failed to result in peace 
the company could be adversely affected by hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
in addition  the sale of products manufactured in israel may be adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of violent conflicts involving israel and other nations may impede the company s ability to sell its products in certain countries 
in addition  some of the company s employees in israel are subject to being called upon to perform military service in israel  and their absence may have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
generally  unless exempt  male adult citizens and permanent residents of israel under the age of are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
additionally  all such residents are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
these conditions could disrupt the company s operations in israel and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s costs of operations have at times been affected by changes in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting from changes in the value of the israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar  and from difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified scientific  engineering and technical personnel in israel  where the availability of such personnel has at times been severely limited 
changes in these cost factors have from time to time been significant and difficult to predict  and could in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s historical operating results reflect substantial benefits it has received from programs sponsored by the israeli government for the support of research and development  as well as tax moratoriums and favorable tax rates associated with investments in approved projects approved enterprises in israel 
some of these programs and tax benefits have ceased and others may not be continued in the future and the availability of such benefits to the company may be affected by a number of factors  including budgetary constraints resulting from adverse economic conditions  government policies and the company s ability to satisfy eligibility criteria 
the israeli government has reduced the benefits available under some of these programs in recent years  and israeli government authorities have indicated that the government may further reduce or eliminate some of these benefits in the future 
the company has regularly participated in a conditional grant program administered by the ocs under which it has received significant benefits through reimbursement of up to of qualified research and development expenditures 
verint currently pays royalties  of between and or under certain circumstances of associated product revenues including service and other related revenues to the government of israel for repayment of benefits received under this program 
such royalty payments by verint are currently required to be made until the government has been reimbursed the amounts received by the company plus  for amounts received under projects approved by the ocs after january   interest on such amount at a rate equal to the month libor rate in effect on january of the year in which approval is obtained 
during fiscal  comverse entered into an arrangement with the ocs whereby comverse agreed to pay a lump sum royalty amount for all past amounts received from the ocs 
in addition  comverse will receive lower amounts from the ocs than it has historically received  but will not have to pay royalty amounts on future grants 
the amount of reimbursement received by the company under this program has been reduced significantly  and the company does not expect to receive significant reimbursement under this program in the future 
in addition  permission from the government of israel is required for the company to manufacture outside of israel products resulting from research and development activities funded under these programs  or to transfer outside of israel related technology rights 
in order to obtain such permission  the company may be required to increase the royalties to the applicable funding agencies and or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and development costs 
the continued reduction in the benefits received by the company under the program  or the termination of its eligibility to receive these benefits at all in the future  could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s overall effective tax rate benefits from the tax moratorium provided by the government of israel for approved enterprises undertaken in that country 
the company s effective tax rate may increase due to  among other factors  the increased proportion of its taxable income associated with activities in higher tax jurisdictions  and by the relative ages of the company s eligible investments in israel 
the tax moratorium on income from the company s approved enterprise investments made prior to is four years  whereas subsequent approved enterprise projects are eligible for a moratorium of only two years 
reduced tax rates apply in each case for certain periods thereafter 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must continue to meet conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets and financing a percentage of investments with share capital 
if the company fails to meet such conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
israeli authorities have indicated that additional limitations on the tax benefits associated with approved enterprise projects may be imposed for certain categories of taxpayers  which would include the company 
if further changes in the law or government policies regarding those programs were to result in their termination or adverse modification  or if the company were to become unable to participate in  or take advantage of  those programs  the cost of the company s operations in israel would increase and there could be a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
the company s success is dependent on recruiting and retaining key management and highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
the competition for highly skilled personnel remains very competitive despite the current economic conditions 
the company s ability to attract and retain employees also may be affected by recent cost control actions  including reductions in the company s workforce and the associated reorganization of operations 
the occurrence or perception of security breaches within the company could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
while the company implements sophisticated security measures  third parties may attempt to breach the company s security through computer viruses  electronic break ins and other disruptions 
if successful  confidential information  including passwords  financial information  or other personal information may be improperly obtained and the company may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
even if the company is not held liable  a security breach could harm the company s reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of the company s products 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its total sales from customers outside of the united states 
international transactions involve particular risks  including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade conditions  rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries  turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets  and increased costs resulting from lack of proximity to the customer 
the company is required to obtain export licenses and other authorizations from applicable governmental authorities for certain countries within which it conducts business 
the failure to receive any required license or authorization would hinder the company s ability to sell its products and could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  legal uncertainties regarding liability  compliance with local laws and regulations  labor laws  employee benefits  currency restrictions  difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer collection periods and other requirements may have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the risk of currency instability is increased by prevailing conditions of economic weakness in a number of world markets  and the potential for recession 
the company has  and anticipates that it will continue to receive  significant contracts denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the euro 
as a result of the unpredictable timing of purchase orders and payments under such contracts and other factors  it is often not practicable for the company to effectively hedge the risk of significant changes in currency rates during the contract period 
the company may experience risk associated with the failure to hedge the exchange rate risks associated with contracts denominated in foreign currencies and its operating results have been and may continue to be negatively affected to a material extent by the impact of currency fluctuations 
operating results may also be affected by the cost of such hedging activities that the company does undertake 
while the company generally requires employees  independent contractors and consultants to execute non competition and confidentiality agreements  the company s intellectual property or proprietary rights could be infringed or misappropriated  which could result in expensive and protracted litigation 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law to protect its technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use its products or technology 
effectively policing the unauthorized use of the company s products is time consuming and costly  and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of its technology  particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the united states 
if others claim that the company s products infringe their intellectual property rights  the company may be forced to seek expensive licenses  reengineer its products  engage in expensive and time consuming litigation or stop marketing its products 
the company attempts to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in its product development efforts 
the company does not regularly conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in its products infringes patents held by third parties  however 
there are many issued patents as well as patent applications in the fields in which the company is engaged 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to the company s software and products 
if the company were to discover that its products violated or potentially violated third party proprietary rights  it might not be able to obtain licenses to continue offering those products without substantial reengineering 
any reengineering effort may not be successful  nor can the company be certain that any licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the telecommunications industry  and the company expects that its products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in its industry segments grows and the functionality of software products in different industry segments overlaps 
in addition  the company has agreed to indemnify customers in certain situations should it be determined that its products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any third party infringement claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product and service delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against the company and its failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company holds a large proportion of its net assets in cash equivalents and short term investments  including a variety of public and private debt and equity instruments  and has made significant venture capital investments  both directly and through private investment funds 
such investments subject the company to the risks inherent in the capital markets generally  and to the performance of other businesses over which it has no direct control 
given the relatively high proportion of the company s liquid assets relative to its overall size  the results of its operations are materially affected by the results of the company s capital management and investment activities and the risks associated with those activities 
declines in the public equity markets have caused  and may be expected to continue to cause  the company to experience realized and unrealized investment losses 
in addition  while the company s interest and other income has benefited from the positive spread between the fixed interest it pays on its outstanding indebtedness and interest earned on the investment of its cash balances  reduction in prevailing interest rates due to economic conditions or government policies has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the severe decline in the public trading prices of equity securities  particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors  and corresponding decline in values of privately held companies and venture capital funds in which the company has invested  have  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on the company s financial results and costs of operations 
the company has in the past benefited from the long term rise in the public trading price of its shares in various ways  including its ability to use equity incentive arrangements as a means of attracting and retaining the highly qualified employees necessary for the growth of its business and its ability to raise capital on relatively attractive conditions 
the decline in the price of the company s shares  and the overall decline in equity prices generally  and in the shares of technology companies in particular  can be expected to make it more difficult for the company to rely on equity incentive arrangements as a means to recruit and retain talented employees  and negatively has impacted the ability of the company to raise capital on terms as advantageous to the company as in the past 
the trading price of the company s shares has been affected by the factors disclosed herein as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
share prices of companies in technology related industries  such as the company  tend to exhibit a high degree of volatility 
the announcement of financial results that fall short of the results anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant negative effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of the company s sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to the volatility of the trading value of its shares regardless of the company s long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the telecommunications equipment industry in general  and the company s business segments in particular  which may not have any direct relationship with the company s business or prospects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity trading prices  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company may  from time to time  use foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflows and outflows resulting from the sale of its products in foreign currency will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in most instances  the company elects not to hedge these transactions 
management does not expect any significant changes in the strategies it employs to manage such exposure in the near future 
as of january   the company had no material outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts 
various financial instruments held by the company are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the company s investments in debt securities due to differences between the market interest rates and rates at the date of purchase of these financial instruments 
neither a basis point increase nor decrease from current interest rates would have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
equity investments held by the company are subject to equity price risks 
neither a increase nor decrease in equity prices would have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
