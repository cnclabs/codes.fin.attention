fiscal in thousands of dollars fiscal year net sales microelectronic segment display segment total net sales cost of sales microelectronic segment display segment total cost of sales gross margin microelectronic segment display segment total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales revenues net sales decreased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  sales in the microelectronic segment declined by and were partially offset by a increase in display segment revenue 
commercial sales in the microelectronic segment decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was directly related to the decline in the telecommunication and datacommunication markets  which began in the third quarter of fiscal year cisco systems and lucent technologies  telecommunication and datacommunication customers that accounted for of microelectronic segment sales during fiscal year  accounted for less than of sales for the microelectronic segment in fiscal year the sales to cisco and lucent in fiscal occurred during the first two quarters of that year and were based on orders booked in fiscal these two customers alone accounted for half of the million decrease in commercial microelectronic sales over the comparable periods  while the remaining decrease was attributable to lower purchases by other telecommunication and datacommunication customers 
it is unknown when the telecommunication and datacommunication markets will recover  or if they will increase to  or exceed  historical levels 
the million decline in commercial sales was offset by an approximate million increase in high reliability sales in the microelectronic segment 
high reliability revenues increased and were million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  sales of the newly developed tamper resistant coating technology totaled approximately million in fiscal year  while fiscal year did not have any sales  as the product was still under development 
the increase in high reliability sales included higher volume sales of high density  multi chip packages used in domestic and international defense and avionic applications 
the upward trend of high reliability sales is expected to continue because of the current economic and political environment relating to defense spending 
display segment revenue increased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  ruggedized display sales decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  sales of interface and 
table of contents mechanical components remained flat from the comparable period at approximately million 
sales of commercial display products increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the majority of the increase of commercial display sales was attributable to an increase of million in sales to general electric medical division and garmin international 
the sales volume from the previous year to general electric and garmin increased because of the introduction of new medical and global positioning system products that began production in fiscal excluding the sales to general electric and garmin  sales to other commercial display product customers increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase is due to the fact that fiscal includes twelve months of panelview revenue while fiscal only includes eight months of panelview revenue  since the acquisition of panelview occurred february of the additional four month period of october through january in fiscal year accounted for million in revenue 
therefore  sales of commercial products to other customers actually decreased approximately  during the comparable period of february through september versus the same period in sales of commercial display products will continue to be dependent on the activities of general electric and garmin and the strength of their markets over the coming year 
sales of commercial display products to other customers are dependent on general economic conditions and the company s ability to penetrate other markets with enhanced viewing displays 
gross margin total company gross margin increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total company gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  gross margin dollars for the microelectronic segment increased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment sales was and for the years ended september   and september   respectively 
during fiscal  sales of high reliability products totaled approximately million as compared to million in fiscal sales of commercial products were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal because sales of high reliability products made up the majority of microelectronic segment sales and their margins exceeded  the overall segment margin improved by  while the overall segment margin dollars only increased by  primarily as a result of the change in product mix 
at the same time  sales of commercial microelectronic products  which have margins averaging around  declined by million from the previous year and made up a smaller percentage of sales in fiscal the decrease in margin dollars from the commercial products was offset by the increase in margin dollars from the high reliability products 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  based on numerous order cancellations and a severe decrease in demand for the company s products used in the telecommunications industry  the company reviewed the major inventory items in raw materials that did not have a forecasted demand for usage 
approximately million of inventory was identified that fell within this category 
of that million of inventory  the company identified items that were not expected to be used within the next twelve months and would probably become obsolete over that period 
the company reserved million against this inventory based on its estimates of the parts most likely to go unused 
in addition to the million reserve  approximately million of additional inventory was scrapped during that quarter because of poor yields or obsolescence 
therefore  the gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal year decreased due to the approximate million of inventory related charges taken in the microelectronic segment during the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  approximately  of the inventory identified in fiscal year was scrapped and charged against the reserve 
the amount of inventory in this excess category gradually decreased to approximately million from million  as of september  as this excess inventory was used  it was charged through cost of goods sold when it shipped 
during this time  the company completed quarterly inventory reviews and determined that a raw material reserve of approximately million was still needed to account for possible inventory obsolescence of these remaining parts because of their age and lack of usage 
also during this period  an additional  of finished goods items were identified as slow moving and were placed on reserve 
these 
table of contents additional items require the company to maintain a million reserve for raw materials and finished goods 
in fiscal year  these activities did not have a material impact on gross margins and operating results 
gross margin as a percentage of commercial microelectronic sales for fiscal year totaled after the previously mentioned inventory write down 
gross margin as a percentage of commercial microelectronic sales for fiscal year was  or higher than the previous year 
however  due to the decline in sales in fiscal year from fiscal year  actual gross margin dollars on commercial microelectronic sales decreased million 
gross margin for high reliability sales for fiscal year increased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was due to lower component costs than in the previous year 
therefore  even though microelectronic segment revenue decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year  gross margin dollars increased due to the higher sales and higher margin on high reliability microelectronic sales compared to commercial microelectronic sales 
gross margin as a percentage of display segment sales decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the decrease of gross margin as a percentage of display segment sales was due to significantly higher commercial product sales over the comparable period which have a much lower gross margin than ruggedized display sales 
gross margin as a percentage of commercial product sales was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year  due to high volume sales during fiscal year which had a slightly lower margin 
gross margin on ruggedized display sales also decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year mainly because of lower sales in  but still averaged approximately for the year 
as a result  although display revenue increased for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   gross margin dollars only increased  or million 
operating expenses in thousands of dollars fiscal year selling  general and administrative product development interest expense interest income amortization of intangible assets total expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total selling expenses for the year ended september  totaled million  which was million lower than the year ended september  the overall reduction was attributable to decreased selling expenses in the microelectronic segment due to lower commission expense on lower sales 
the million decrease in microelectronic segment selling expenses was offset by an increase of million in display segment selling expenses  which was attributable to higher commission expense and an increase of sales personnel 
total company commission expense totaled million and million for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
selling expense in fiscal year was of sales  compared to in the prior year 
total selling expenses are expected to remain consistent with changes in sales through the next fiscal year 
total general and administrative expenses  including corporate expenses  totaled million for the year ended september   which was consistent with general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  general and administrative expenses for the microelectronic segment totaled million in fiscal year  which accounted for a  decrease from fiscal year due to a reduction of administrative personnel and a reduction of spending 
the decrease in the microelectronic segment was offset by a  increase in general and administrative expenses in the display segment  which related to an increase of spending in that segment 
corporate expenses for the comparable years were relatively the same 
total general and administrative expenses 
table of contents were of sales for fiscal  compared to of sales in the prior year 
total general and administrative expenses may increase slightly because of increases in wages  corporate services  and other expenses related to corporate administration 
product development expenses product development expenses for the year ended september  decreased  or million  as compared to the year ended september  a portion of the decrease was due to fewer commercial products under development in the microelectronic segment  accounting for a decrease in commercial product development expenses  or  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  the company began its product development on tamper resistant coating for certain high reliability microelectronic devices 
the tamper resistant coating development was complete by the end of fiscal year  and the process went into production at the start of fiscal year therefore  fiscal year included  of product development expenses for tamper resistant coating  while all tamper resistant coating expenses for fiscal year were a part of the cost of sales for the microelectronic segment 
ongoing product development projects for the microelectronic division include new packaging designs for memory products to include sdram  ssram  microprocessor modules  and ball grid array products  continual development of tamper resistant coating technology  and qualification of new semiconductor products 
total microelectronic product development was million for the year ended september  the display segment increased product development expenses slightly  as new engineers were hired during the last part of fiscal year to expand display coating and enhancement technologies 
total display product development was million for the year ended september  for the company as a whole  product development expenses were and of sales for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
the company expects product development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of sales in the future 
interest expense income interest expense for the year ended september  totaled  a  decrease from the year ended september  interest expense during fiscal year was incurred on the company s line of credit and a bank one term loan 
the line of credit was paid of during the third quarter of and was not used during fiscal year the bank one term loan was paid off during the second quarter of fiscal year two additional bank notes totaling million were secured for the purchase of capital equipment during the second quarter of fiscal year both notes were paid off during september since there was available cash  and the company could reduce its interest expense 
once the company paid off its line of credit  the company began maintaining its excess cash in an interest bearing money market account  which was opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest income on this account totaled  for the year ended september  amortization of intangible assets amortization expense for the year ended september  increased  when compared to the year ended september  both years had amortization expense of  relating to the electronic designs and bowmar merger of fiscal year included eight months of amortization expense for the panelview acquisition  while fiscal year includes twelve months of amortization expense 
thus  the  difference of amortization relates to the four additional months of panelview amortization in fiscal year beginning in fiscal year  the company will adopt sfas see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  newly issued accounting standards 
the effect of this accounting standard will be to stop amortization of goodwill 
we expect the adoption of this standard for fiscal year will reduce amortization expense by million for the year as compared to fiscal 
table of contents the intangible asset relating to the electronic designs and bowmar merger has two components 
the first component is an assembled workforce asset 
the remaining assembled workforce asset amount of  will be subsumed into goodwill at the beginning of fiscal year upon adoption of fas the second component is a technology asset amortized at  per month and will be fully amortized as of october therefore  amortization expense for fiscal year will total approximately  this intangible asset is not impaired and will continue to amortize through fiscal since it is not classified as goodwill 
income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reduced its valuation allowance of approximately million operating loss carry forwards  as the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize a benefit for the deferred tax 
the company also reversed approximately million of tax reserves that had been recorded in previous years 
an additional million of tax benefit was also recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to recognize the extra territorial exclusion credit for foreign sales this fiscal year 
in total  a tax benefit of approximately million attributable to the items mentioned above was recorded during the quarter ended september   reducing the annual tax liability to  and reducing the applied tax rate to an effective rate of for the year 
the company also recorded a  tax benefit from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal results of operations in thousands of dollars fiscal year net sales microelectronic segment display segment total net sales cost of sales microelectronic segment display segment total cost of sales gross margin microelectronic segment display segment total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales revenues net sales increased to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a increase in sales of the display segment to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the majority of the increase was due to the inclusion of panelview s million of sales in fiscal the remaining million increase included a million increase in ruggedized display sales  offset by a slight decrease in electromechanical sales 
sales of ruggedized displays increased because of increased activity in the military aerospace industry  as well as new sales to industrial customers needing ruggedization for outdoor use  such as oilfield services 
panelview sales of display viewing enhancement systems accounted for million of the revenue generated by that subsidiary 
the outdoor recreation and medical instrumentation industries accounted for approximately million of panelview s sales for fiscal year net sales for the microelectronic segment decreased slightly to million for the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  high reliability microelectronic sales increased to million from million  while commercial microelectronic sales declined to million  compared to million in the prior year 
a general increase in spending for the electronic components used in defense systems caused the increase in sales of high reliability products  as order rates increased through the year 
sales of commercial components were hurt by the slowdown in the telecommunications and network equipment industry during many of the company s customers experienced excess inventories when demand for their products slowed in early this excess inventory caused many of those customers to dramatically reduce their orders for the company s products  causing sales for the second half of fiscal to be approximately lower than the first half 

table of contents gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september  the microelectronic segment saw a decline of margins to from of sales 
in march  based on numerous order cancellations and a severe decrease in demand for the company s products used in the telecommunications industry  the company reviewed the major inventory items in raw materials that did not have a forecasted demand for usage 
approximately million of inventory was identified that fell into this category 
of that million of inventory  the company identified items that were not expected to be used within the next twelve months and would probably become obsolete over that period 
the company reserved million against this inventory based on its estimates of the parts most likely to go unused 
during fiscal year  approximately  of the identified inventory was scrapped and charged against the reserve 
in addition to the million reserve  approximately million of additional inventory was scrapped during that quarter because of poor yields or obsolescence 
therefore  the decrease of gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily caused by approximately million of inventory related charges taken in the microelectronic segment during the second quarter of fiscal year fiscal was also a period of rapidly falling prices for some electronic memory components 
this downward pricing pressure made it difficult to maintain margins for commercial microelectronic components 
gross margin as a percentage of sales for commercial products  including the effect of the inventory charges  decreased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of sales for high reliability products over this same period increased approximately from fiscal year gross margin for the display segment saw a decline to from in the previous year 
even though actual dollar gross margin on display sales increased by million from the previous year  the percentage declined mainly because of the inclusion of panelview display products that traditionally have margins approximating  while ruggedized display products have margins of approximately 
actual margins for ruggedized display products were in fiscal  compared to in the prior year 
the slight decrease was mainly because of new programs implemented in the second half of the year that required time to develop production efficiencies 
operating expenses in thousands of dollars fiscal year selling  general and administrative product development interest expense interest income amortization of intangible assets total expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased  from the previous year 
microelectronic sales expense declined  while display sales expense increased  due to the inclusion of panelview expenses  which totaled  for the year 
the decrease in the microelectronic selling expense was due to a decrease in commissions on lower sales  and a reduction of work force in commercial microelectronics 
overall selling expenses were also reduced due to a company wide effort to reduce overall spending 
selling expense in fiscal was of sales  compared to in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses  including corporate expenses  increased  overall for the year ended september   of which  was due to the inclusion of expenses from the panelview division 
the remaining increase of general and administrative expense was due to an increase of corporate headcount and an increase in general corporate expenses such as legal  information services  accounting  and insurance expenses 
some 
table of contents administrative expenses  such as insurance  were generally higher due to the acquisition of panelview during the year 
information services expenses were higher because of the installation of a new enterprise computer system at our commercial division 
total general and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in the prior year 
research and product development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended september  increased  from the previous year 
these expenses totaled of net sales for the current period  which was slightly lower than the from the prior year 
the main source of the increase came from the microelectronic segment  which increased spending  from the previous year 
during this period  the microelectronic segment spent  to begin development of tamper resistant memory modules 
other major ongoing product development efforts in the microelectronic segment include sdram  ssram  microprocessor modules  ball grid array products  development of new packaging designs for memory products  and qualification of new semiconductor products 
the display segment product development expenses were  less than last year due to a reduction in interface equipment development 
interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended september   when compared to the previous year 
borrowings against the line of credit declined during the third and fourth quarters due to increased cash flow because of collection of accounts receivable  a reduction of inventory purchases  a reduction of payroll due to a decreased headcount  and a reduction in overall company wide spending 
interest rates in fiscal year decreased significantly since fiscal year with averages for the twelve month period dropping to from and quarterly averages declining to from 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense increased  for the year ended september   when compared to the previous year 
the amortization expense for fiscal year included  per month of goodwill expense associated with the electronic designs and crystallume merger 
that intangible asset was fully amortized as of september both comparable fiscal years had amortization expense of  relating to the electronic designs and bowmar merger 
fiscal year included eight months monthly amortization expense of  for the panelview acquisition that occurred january  seasonality and inflation the company s business is not seasonal in nature 
management believes that the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements include the following items inventory represents a significant portion of the company s assets 
historically  the company has experienced fluctuations in the demand for its products based on cyclical fluctuations in the microelectronic and display industries 
these fluctuations in demand may cause our inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
therefore  in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management makes these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not been significant or have not differed materially from the company s estimates 
the company estimates potential warranty obligations for its products based on annual product sales and historical customer product return data 
based on this data  the company records estimated warranty reserves and expense needed to account for the estimated cost of product returns 
the company maintains a pension plan for certain employees 
to account for the expenses relating to this plan  the company makes estimates concerning the expected rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of income expected to be earned in the future 
the company bases its estimates on the expected rate of return using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as financial industry projections for future returns on equities and fixed income investments 
if the actual future rate of return on plan assets does not equal the estimated rate  the company may have to fund future benefit obligations by contributing money from company general assets into the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the future benefit obligations of the plan 
a lower discount rate increases the liability of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
the company uses published bond yields to estimate the discount rate to use for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
in fiscal  the company will adopt sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of this standard will require impairment testing of the goodwill recorded for the panelview acquisition on an annual basis  or more often  if necessary 
the company will make estimates during the evaluation of the goodwill concerning the value of assets and liabilities and expected future cash flows to determine the validity of the goodwill amount on the balance sheet as compared to the business valuation placed on the panelview subsidiary 
if these estimates do not assign a valuation to the panelview subsidiary that is higher than the balance sheet amount  a goodwill impairment charge will need to be taken through the income statement 
the company follows accounting standard sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this standard requires the company to recognize a deferred tax asset for the reduction of income taxes that will be applied using previous years operating loss carry forwards 
the ability to recognize this asset is based on the expectations that the company will be profitable in future periods 
if these estimated future profits do not occur  the company may not be able to use its operating loss carry forwards and the asset will become impaired 
if the deferred tax asset becomes impaired  a charge will need to be taken through the income statement 
the majority of the company s sales are recognized when the product ships to the customer 
some product shipments are to a distributor and may be returned based on conditions set forth in their distributor agreement 
therefore  actual sales on those shipments are not recognized until the distributor ships the product to its customer and notifies the company of the shipment at the end of the month 
this deferred revenue is included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of september  totaled million 
during fiscal year  cash provided by operations was approximately million 
the sum of net income  excluding the million non cash tax benefit item described below  depreciation  and amortization totaled approximately million for the year 
capital expenditures for the year were approximately million 
excluding the change in the panelview purchase liability  accrued expenses increased approximately million from the prior year 
the  change in the panelview purchase liability was a non cash transaction 

table of contents accounts receivable increased million from the fiscal year ended september  this increase is consistent with higher quarterly sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year when compared to the fourth quarter of last year 
sales were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year versus million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the accounts receivable balance of million at september  represents of the current quarterly sales rate and is lower than the ratio at september  the lower ratio is due to a higher collection rate in both the microelectronic segment and display segment 
inventory levels decreased approximately million during fiscal year this decrease is the result of lower purchases of inventory by the company s microelectronic segment  which offsets the additional inventory on hand for the display segment to support their increased revenues 
the current inventory balances for both segments take into account projected first quarter fiscal year production requirements 
inventory amounts  when compared to the current quarterly sales rate  decreased to of fourth quarter sales in fiscal year from of fourth quarter sales in fiscal year the company is currently managing its inventory levels to match projected production requirements 
the company will continue to review inventory levels against projected demand for obsolescence and the lower of cost or market factors and will make appropriate adjustments when needed 
accounts payable as of september  were million more than at the end of fiscal year accrued expenses increased million since the prior year end 
the change in accrued expenses includes a  increase in income taxes because of higher income in fiscal  a  increase in payroll accruals relating to higher incentive compensation than the previous year  and a  increase in estimated warranty expenses mainly because of higher sales for the display business segment 
the company maintains a pension plan for its union employees at its fort wayne  indiana facility pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement 
mainly because of the severe decline in the equity markets during fiscal  a higher than expected benefit payout rate based on a new contract with the union and a lower discount rate  the pension benefit obligation is currently under funded by approximately  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional financial details 
the company expects to fund its pension obligation through expected investment income on plan assets and cash contributions to the plan over the next several years 
the actual amount of cash contributions will be dependent on the actual investment income during that period 
the company believes that funding the plan over the next several years will not have a material effect on the company s liquidity 
also  the company recognized a minimum pension liability of  net of tax  and a long term pension liability of  on its balance sheet for fiscal relating to the decrease in value of plan assets during the year 
in fiscal  the company expects actual pension expense to increase from  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended september   totaled approximately million 
approximately million was spent on production equipment for the microelectronic manufacturing facilities  including million spent on a specific piece of testing equipment for the high reliability components 
an additional million was spent on production equipment for the display manufacturing facilities  including approximately million spent on a specific piece of coating equipment for the display division 
approximately million was spent on leasehold improvements for panelview s new building in oregon 
the remaining million of capital expenditures related to computer equipment and various other office equipment purchased throughout the company 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately the same as fiscal the company believes future capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations  line of credit borrowings  or operating lease financing 

table of contents financing activities used  of cash during fiscal year the company secured two bank notes through bank one na totaling approximately million for the purchase of capital equipment during the second quarter of fiscal year due to the availability of cash on hand  both notes were paid off during september the company also paid down the original bank one note that had a balance of million as of the beginning of this fiscal year 
therefore  the company borrowed million and repaid million  bringing total company debt down to zero as of september  approximately  of cash was generated during fiscal year through the issuance of common stock 
of that   of common stock was issued for the exercise of stock options  and  of common stock was issued through the employee stock purchase plan 
the company had the use of a million revolving credit agreement with bank one for short term financing needs  but amended that agreement as of march   to reduce the borrowing ability to a maximum of million based on lower borrowing expectations and to reduce unused credit line fees 
the bank one amended revolving line of credit bears a variable interest rate  which was as of september   and extends until march  as of the end of the fourth quarter  the company was in compliance with all debt covenant requirements in the credit agreement 
the revolving credit line has been fully paid since july  and the company is generating a level of internal cash flow sufficient to sustain the current level of day to day operations 
the company believes that cash generated by operations  in addition to its borrowing capability  should be sufficient to fund its cash needs for the next twelve months as well as over the long term 
if we are able to identify appropriate opportunities  the company may need to incur debt and or issue additional equity securities in connection with one or more acquisitions 
contractual cash obligations in thousands of dollars payments due by period as of september  less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations recently enacted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combination 
the provisions of sfas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that upon adoption of sfas  the company reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested at least annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 

table of contents however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the first step 
the company expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment using a one step process  which compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year  and pursuant to the requirements of sfas  will be completed during the first quarter of fiscal any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal the company adopted the provisions of sfas for fiscal year  which began september  at that time  the company stopped the monthly amortization of  for panelview purchased goodwill and will assess the need for any changes in the remaining goodwill asset based on further valuation 
the company also stopped amortization on the assembled work force asset relating to the edi and bowmar merger  as this component was subsumed into goodwill upon adoption of sfas because of the continuing goodwill amortization through the end of fiscal and the increasing sales and profits at the panelview subsidiary  the company  at this time  believes that an impairment charge will not be needed in the first quarter of fiscal the actual result will not be known until the completion of the impairment tests

the company believes that adoption of this standard will have no material effect on the company s financial reporting and disclosure 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of the fiscal year ended september   the company had no outstanding balance against its revolving line of credit with bank one  nor did it borrow against the line of credit during the fiscal year 
should the company have borrowed against the line  the interest charged against these borrowings would have been a combination of the bank one prime rate  which is similar to the prime rate charged by major banking institutions in the united states  and the london interbank offering rate libor plus 
during fiscal the prime rate averaged  and was as of september  the company is subject to changes in prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
the company is also subject to fluctuations in the libor rate 
as of the end of september   the libor rate was approximately 
due to the average borrowing rate of zero dollars over the past fiscal year  a change in interest rate would not affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
should the company begin borrowing against the credit line  a hypothetical increased rate change of would increase interest expense by approximately  per average million dollars borrowed on an annual basis from current expense levels 
the company believes that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future
