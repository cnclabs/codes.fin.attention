item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since its inception in november  the company has been engaged primarily in research and development activities which have culminated in the commercial launch of hextend  its lead product  and a clinical trial of pentalyte 
the company s operating revenues have been generated primarily from licensing fees  including  received from abbott laboratories for the right to manufacture and market hextend r in the united states and canada 
as a result of the developmental nature of its business and the limited sales of its product  since the company s inception in november it has incurred  of losses 
the company s ability to generate substantial operating revenue depends upon its success in developing and marketing or licensing its plasma volume expanders and organ preservation solutions and technology for medical use 
most of the company s research and development efforts have been devoted to the company s first three blood volume replacement products hextend  r pentalyte  r and hetacool 
tm by testing and bringing all three products to the market  biotime can increase its market share by providing the medical community with solutions to match patients needs 
by developing technology for the use of hetacool in low temperature surgery  trauma care  and organ transplant surgery  biotime may also create new market segments for its product line 
the company s first product  hextend  is a physiologically balanced blood plasma volume expander  for the treatment of hypovolemia 
hextend is being sold in the united states by abbott laboratories under an exclusive license from the company 
abbott also has the right to sell hextend in canada  where an application for marketing approval is pending 
abbott also has a right to obtain licenses to manufacture and sell other biotime products 
under its license agreement with the company  abbott will report sales of hextend and pay the company the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
the company recognizes such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as the company does not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
hextend sales are still in the ramp up phase 
revenues for the year ended december  include royalties on sales made by abbott during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalties on sales recognized as revenues made during that month period were  royalties on sales during the three month period ending december  were  but will not be recognized by the company for financial accounting purposes until the first quarter of fiscal year hextend sales are still in the ramp up phase  as illustrated by the following graph 
the following descriptive data is supplied in accordance with rule d of regulation s t

semi annual hextend r sales millions jul dec jan jun jul dec jan jun jul dec the graph illustrates semi annual sales of hextend derived from quarterly sales reports provided to biotime by abbott with royalty payments 
royalties on sales that occurred during the third quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended december  royalties on sales that occurred during the third quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended december  royalties on sales that occurred during the fourth quarter of will be reflected in the company s financial statements for the first quarter of as shown above  semi annual sales of hextend have increased from the last half of  when the product was first launched  through the last half of sales during the last half of were strong despite the adverse influences of the events of september   and sales of hextend continue to rise progressively from year to year 
biotime attributes these gains in semi annual sales to escalating marketing efforts  an accelerating demand for hextend by physicians and hospitals due to its outstanding performance in many hundreds of operating rooms around the country  and recent clinical trial results which highlight its many clinical benefits 
based on preliminary estimates  current monthly sales of hextend are nearly half of the amount of monthly sales the company needs to operate at the break even point at the present reduced rate of company spending  which includes substantial salary reductions and limited research and development activities 
as part of the marketing program  a number of studies have been conducted that show the advantages of receiving hextend and other biotime products during surgery 
for example  the results of a clinical trial by nj wilkes et al performed in england and entitled the effects of balanced versus saline based hetastarch and crystalloid solutions on acid base and electrolyte status and gastric mucosal perfusion in elderly surgical patients was published in the october edition of anesthesia and analgesia  and underscores a number of hextend benefits including maintenance of normal acid base balance  blood calcium and chloride levels and perfusion of portions of the gastro intestinal tract 
furthermore  the results of a clinical study of cardiac surgery patients at columbia university medical center in new york were presented at the annual meeting of the anesthesiology society of america 
in that study  patients receiving hextend had better outcomes than patients receiving other surgical fluids hetastarch in normal saline  albumin in saline and lactated ringer s  based upon maintenance of renal function  avoidance of dialysis  avoidance of deep venous thromboses  lower level of pain  nausea and suffering  shorter time to first meal  and less clotting abnormalities 
as future studies such as these are completed  the results will be presented at medical conferences and articles will be written for publication in medical journals 
the company is also aware of independent studies using hextend that are being conducted by physicians and hospitals who may publish their findings in medical journals or report their findings at medical conferences 
the outcome of future medical studies and timing of the publication or presentation of the results could have an effect on hextend sales 
hextend has become the standard plasma volume expander at a number of prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers 
biotime feels that as hextend use proliferates within the leading us hospitals  other smaller hospitals will follow their lead and accelerate sales growth 
hextend is being evaluated by a number of military physicians as a plasma volume expander in the treatment of hypovolemia in combat casualties 
this was the topic of a number of formal presentations and discussions at combat fluid resuscitation  a meeting held at the uniformed services university of the health sciences in bethesda  maryland in june   under their auspices and that of the office of naval research and the us army medical research and materiel command 
additionally  a meeting was held at hahnemann university medical college of pennsylvania in philadelphia on october  at which military and civilian medical and scientific personnel discussed making recommendations to the united states military on the use of intravenous fluids and medical devices to treat combat casualties 
hextend was among the fluids considered during this meeting 
the company has completed a phase i clinical trial of pentalyte and is planning the next phase of its clinical trials in which pentalyte will be used to treat hypovolemia in surgery 
the company is also continuing to develop solutions for low temperature surgery 
once a sufficient amount of data from successful low temperature surgery has been compiled  the company plans to seek permission to use hextend as a complete replacement for blood under near freezing conditions 
biotime currently plans to market hextend for complete blood volume replacement at very low temperatures under the registered trade mark hetacool tm after fda approval is obtained 
abbott has an option to obtain a license to market pentalyte and hetacool in the united states and canada  and biotime would receive additional license fees if those options are exercised  in addition to royalties on subsequent sales of those products 
biotime and certain pharmaceutical companies are discussing potential manufacturing  distributing and marketing agreements for biotime products in the rest of the world 
in order to commence clinical trials for regulatory approval of new products or new therapeutic uses of products  it will be necessary for the company to prepare and file with the fda an investigational new drug application ind or an amendment to expand a previous filing 
filings with foreign regulatory agencies will be required to commence clinical trials overseas 
the company has filed an application to market hextend in canada  and its first application for approval in a european union member nation  sweden 
regulatory approvals for other countries that are members of the european union may be obtained through a mutual recognition process 
if approvals can be obtained in the requisite number of member nations  then the company would be permitted to market hextend in all member nations 
biotime is continuing to work with the appropriate officials to achieve regulatory approval in canada and sweden 
in addition to developing clinical trial programs  the company plans to continue to provide funding for its laboratory testing programs at selected universities  medical schools and hospitals for the purpose of developing additional uses of hextend  pentalyte  hetacool  and other new products  but the amount of research that will be conducted at those institutions will depend upon the company s financial status 
because the company s research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  and production and marketing expenses will be charged against earnings for financial reporting purposes  management expects that there will be losses from operations from time to time during the near future 
hextend r and pentalyte r are registered trademarks  and hetacool tm is a trademark  of biotime 
results of operations year ended december  and year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recognized  of royalty revenues

research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  european clinical trial expenses  salaries  preparation of additional regulatory applications in the united states and europe  manufacturing of solution for trials  and consultants fees 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase if the company obtains sufficient capital to commence new clinical studies of its products in the united states and europe 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to significant increases in expenditures for the company s annual report and meeting  fees required for continued stock exchange listing  overall insurance costs  investor public relations costs  legal and accounting fees  and costs associated with continued maintenance of the company s patent portfolio

kingsley  an investor and consultant to the company  who purchased  of debentures  and milton dresner  a director of the company 
mr 
kingsley s investment included the conversion of the  principal balance of a line of credit that he had previously provided 
interest on the debentures is payable at an annual rate of and is payable semiannually 
the principal amount of the debentures will be due and payable on august  biotime may prepay the debentures  in whole or in part  at any time without premium or penalty 
under the terms of the debentures  biotime has agreed that commencing october  it will restrict its quarterly cash payments for operating expenses to not more than  excluding interest payable on the debentures plus the amount of cash revenues excluding interest and dividends it collects for the quarter 
to the extent biotime s expenditures during any quarter are less than  over its revenues  it may expend the difference in one or more subsequent quarters 
that restriction will expire when biotime obtains at least  in cash through sales of equity securities or pays off the debenture indebtedness in full 
for this purpose  cash revenues will include royalties  license fees  and other proceeds from the sale or licensing of its products and technology  but will not include interest  dividends  and any monies borrowed or the proceeds from the issue or sale of any debt or equity securities 
biotime has also agreed not to declare or pay any cash dividends on its capital stock or to redeem or repurchase any shares of its capital stock  until it has paid off the debenture indebtedness in full 
investors who purchased the debentures also received warrants to purchase a total of  common shares at an exercise price of per share

the company needs additional capital and greater revenues to continue its current operations  to begin clinical trials of pentalyte  and to conduct its planned product development and research programs 
on march   the company received a new  line of credit 
the company has also retained certain investment bankers on a non exclusive basis to assist the company in raising capital 
however  sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
the company is also continuing to seek new agreements with pharmaceutical companies to provide product and technology licensing fees and royalties 
the availability and terms of equity financing and new license agreements are uncertain 
the unavailability or inadequacy of additional financing or future revenues to meet capital needs could force the company to modify  curtail  delay or suspend some or all aspects of its planned operations 
however  management believes its existing cash and available credit are sufficient to allow the company to operate through december  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes the company s critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing its financial statements debenture and warrant valuation during and in connection with the issuance of  of debt  the company issued warrants to purchase common shares in the company 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and has been recorded at a discount to the debentures 
the discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan 
the company may prepay the debt  in whole or in part  at any time 
if the company were to prepay the debt  the unamortized portion of the discount would be recognized as a loss on the repayment date 
revenue recognition under the company s license agreement with abbott laboratories  the company has received  of license fees based upon achievement of specified milestones 
such fees have been recognized as revenue as the milestones were achieved 
up to  of additional license fees will be payable based upon annual net sales of hextend  at the rate of of annual net sales if annual net sales exceed  or if annual net sales are between  and  abbott s obligation to pay licensing fees on sales of hextend will expire on the earlier of january  or  on a country by country basis  when all patents protecting hextend in the applicable country expire or any third party obtains certain regulatory approvals to market a generic equivalent product in that country 
in addition to the license fees  abbott will pay the company a royalty on total annual net sales of hextend 
the royalty rate will be plus an additional 
for each  of annual net sales  up to a maximum royalty rate of 
the royalty rate for each year will be applied on a total net sales basis 
abbott s obligation to pay royalties on sales of hextend will expire in the united states or canada when all patents protecting hextend in the applicable country expire and any third party obtains certain regulatory approvals to market a generic equivalent product in that country 
the company recognizes such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as the company does not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
revenues for the year ended december  include royalties on sales made by abbott during the twelve months ended september  royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of will not be recognized by the company until the first quarter of fiscal year royalties on sales made during the quarter ended december  were not material to the company s financial results 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that it will not realize some portion of  or all of  the deferred tax assets 
the company bases its determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing evaluation of current evidence including  among other things  estimates of future earnings and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
the company charges or credits adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if the company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  the company would charge to operations an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made
