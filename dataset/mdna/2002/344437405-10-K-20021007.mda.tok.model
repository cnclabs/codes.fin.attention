the company was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up tm mri  fonar tm  quad tm and echo tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company is aggressively seeking new sales and during fiscal received orders for stand up tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the stand up tm mri  fonar tm and quad tm magnets are among the highest field open mri in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
the company s work in progress quad s tm mri scanner will combine fonar s iron frame magnet with a superconducting driver  and is expected to have a field strength between and tesla 
fonar also offers the echo tm  a low cost open mri scanner

see description of business products  works in progress and product marketing 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services including development  administration  accounting and billing and collection services together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of management and leasing fees  which are earned under contracts with mri facilities  medical practices and physical rehabilitation practices 
approximately of hmca s revenues for the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  were derived from contracts with such facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed and currently range from to per mri scan 
the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
the agreements with the medical practices and physical rehabilitation practices are for a term of years 
the fees are fixed monthly fees adjusted annually 
historically  adjustments have been on the basis of changes in hmca s costs  plus a percentage 
currently  the monthly fees under these contracts range from approximately  to  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanner products  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we recognize revenue from license agreements for our intellectual property over the shorter of the contractual life of the license or the estimated economic life 
for our current license agreement  we are recognizing revenue ratably over years 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs is years  years and years  respectively 
we periodically assesses the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
during the year ended june   we recorded an impairment loss of  related to certain management contracts in our physician s management services segment

discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment revenues attributable to the company s medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in scanner sales of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement in revenues was attributable to the company s increase in scanner sales  particularly its stand up tm mri  which is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients in the weight bearing state 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company received orders for stand up tm mri scanners 
confirming the company s expectation of increased demand for its mri scanners  scanner sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal scanner sales to related parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company believes that its principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration are primarily attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of its larger competitors such as general electric  siemens and hitachi and the ability of some of its competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the stand up tm mri  and general electric medical systems division acts as a sales representative for the stand up tm mri 
to date  general electric has purchased four stand up tm mri scanners for resale 
the company recognized revenues of million from the sale of its new stand up tm mri scanners and of  from the sale of two refurbished used beta tm scanners the company no longer manufactures beta tm scanners in fiscal in fiscal  the company recognized revenues of million from the sale of stand up tm mri scanners  million from the sale of quad tm scanners and million from the sale of echo tm scanners 
product sales revenues for fiscal included revenues from the sale of scanners  two of which were used beta tm scanners which were refurbished 
product sales revenues for fiscal included revenues from the sales of seven scanners and for fiscal  three scanners

damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately million of the company s revenues in fiscal  as compared to million of the company s revenues in fiscal license and royalty revenue million in fiscal and million in fiscal remained constant 
gross profit margins on product sales improved significantly during fiscal from a negative in fiscal to in fiscal such improvement was principally attributable to the medical equipment segment operating at a higher level of capacity resulting from the increased sales volume 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  decreased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  its new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the stand up tm mri scanner 
the operating loss for the medical equipment segment improved by from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this improvement is attributable to our increase in gross margins on our scanner sales 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic management services segment revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic management services segment hmca decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflected the closing of certain facilities managed by hmca and the decline in management fees from the primary care practices from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of revenue for the company s physician management services segment decreased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  operating income of this segment declined from million in fiscal to an operating loss of million in fiscal this was attributable to an impairment loss of million recorded in fiscal discussed below and reduced revenues resulting from the closing of several facilities managed by hmca

this expense represented the discount from the market price on the stock issued to the tailwind fund and the value of the purchase warrants granted to the investor 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a debt conversion expense of  in connection with a premium associated with the repayment of approximately million in long term debt incurred in connection with an hmca acquisition see note 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable primarily to the expansion of fonar s increased manufacturing  advertising marketing and sales activity 
in particular  the company engaged the services of an advertising agency and introduced television and radio advertising 
the increase in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal reflected greater use of fonar s stock bonus plan to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than cash 
the higher provision for bad debt of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves and the write off of certain indebtedness by the medical equipment segment of  and reserves for fees due from hmca managed facilities that were closed in the amount of impairment loss during the quarter ended june   the primary care medical practices managed by the company s subsidiary  a a services  inc  experienced a significant overall decline in patient volume and related operating cash flows which led to the inability of the medical practices to fully and timely pay the contractual management fees to the company 
as a result of the continued occurrence of this negative trend  the company recorded an impairment loss of  during the quarter ended june  related to those management agreements which reduced the carrying value of such agreements to  at june  we do not presently expect any further deterioration in our management fees from these primary care medical practices 
the amortization expense in fiscal and of approximately million in each year reflects the amortization of management agreements attributable to hmca s acquisitions 
the company is enthusiastic about the future of its stand up tm mri and fonar tm product line scanners which are bringing a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and are expected to bring a new frontier in surgery for performing surgical treatments using mri images to guide surgery 
the company believes its new products are beginning to successfully penetrate the market  as reflected in the dramatic increase in product sales from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal in addition to increased product sales  the decline in service and repair fees has been reversed  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal continuing its tradition as the originator of mri  the company remained committed to maintaining its position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development

service revenues have also increased over the past there fiscal years  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal  which increases are attributable primarily to the increased number of scanners being placed in service 
most of the revenues on the stand up tm mri scanners sold in the last quarter of fiscal  were not recognized as of june   and as of june   the company s balance sheet reflects million in customer advances 
the company has taken steps to reverse the decline in hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and commencing its program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities it manages with stand up tm mri scanners 
one stand up tm mri is now installed in the islandia  new york site  two are in the process of being installed in bensonhurst  new york and staten island  new york and two are planned for deerfield beach  florida and garden city  new york
