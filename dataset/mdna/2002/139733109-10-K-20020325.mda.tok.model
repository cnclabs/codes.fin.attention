overview our primary business strategy is to purchase real estate land  buildings and other improvements  which we simultaneously lease to operators of franchised automobile dealerships and motor vehicle service  repair  parts or other related businesses under long term  triple net leases 
we focus on buying properties from dealerships that have a long history of operating multi site  multi franchised dealerships  generally targeting the largest dealer groups in terms of revenues in the largest major metropolitan areas in the us in terms of population 
in addition  we also provide facility improvement and expansion funding  construction financing and takeout commitments in certain circumstances 
as of december   we had invested more than billion in properties located in states alabama  arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  florida  georgia  idaho  illinois  indiana  louisiana  maryland  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  utah and virginia  comprising approximately  acres of land and containing approximately million square feet of buildings and improvements 
our tenants operate motor vehicle franchises on our properties  representing nearly brands of motor vehicles  which include all of the top selling brands in the us substantially all of our properties are leased pursuant to long term  triple net leases  under which the tenants typically pay all operating expenses of a property  including  but not limited to  all real estate taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance 
the initial lease terms generally range from to years  with a weighted average initial lease term of approximately years 
the leases typically have options to renew upon the same terms and conditions for one or more additional periods of five to years each exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of five to years 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from rents received or accrued under long term  triple net leases  and interest earned from the temporary investment of funds in short term investments 
we incur general and administrative expenses including  principally  compensation expense for our executive officers and other employees  professional fees and various expenses incurred in the process of identifying and acquiring additional properties 
we are self administered and managed by our trustees  executive officers and other employees 
our primary non cash expense is the depreciation of our properties 
we depreciate buildings and improvements on our properties over a year to year period for tax purposes and a year to year period for financial reporting purposes 
we do not own or lease any significant personal property  furniture or equipment at any property we currently own 
recent developments during the three months ended december   we completed approximately million of acquisitions 
these acquisitions included the purchase of two dealership properties totaling approximately million  five facility improvements and two construction fundings totaling approximately million  all of which were leased to existing tenants 
we funded the acquisitions with funds drawn down on our credit facilities and cash on hand 
these acquisitions added approximately  square feet of buildings and improvements on approximately acres of land and are located in seven states indiana  louisiana  new jersey  ohio  oklahoma  texas and virginia 
these properties have initial lease terms ranging from to years  with a weighted average initial lease term of years 
the leases have renewal options exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of to years 
the following transactions occurred subsequent to december  during january  we signed a letter of intent with sonic automotive  inc and its affiliates sonic to acquire  in a sale leaseback transaction  automotive properties valued at approximately million 
the properties are located in seven states colorado  florida  michigan  nevada  north carolina  tennessee and texas 
these properties include franchises including cadillac  honda  oldsmobile and volvo 
the acquisition  which is expected to close during the second quarter of  is subject to the negotiation and execution of a purchase agreement  and the completion of due diligence and customary closing conditions 
during february  we converted the rent on approximately million of property leased to sonic from variable rate to fixed rate 
at the same time  we entered into interest rate swap arrangements with a third party on approximately million of variable rate debt that is secured primarily by such properties to fix the interest rate 
the new blended rate on the debt is approximately 
fixing the underlying debt simultaneously with the lease conversion continues our strategy of minimizing interest rate risk by substantially match funding our leases with debt in order to lock in our investment spread over the lease term 
the interest rate swaps on the debt were designed to mirror the underlying variable rate debt in terms of index  spread  reset  amortization  compounding and maturity and therefore  we have determined that the derivative instruments are highly effective 
during february  we extended the effective date for our existing interest rate swap on million of variable rate debt from july  to november  the extension of the swap resulted in a change in the fixed rate from to 
all other terms and conditions of the swap remain the same and the swap is still considered to be highly effective 
extending the effective date of the swap continues our strategy of minimizing interest rate risk by substantially match funding our leases with debt in order to lock in our investment spread over the lease term and  at the same time  potentially garnering more spread in the short term 
acquisitions during the year ended december   we completed approximately million of acquisitions  which included dealership properties  facility improvements and expansions on previously acquired properties and three construction fundings 
we funded the acquisitions with net proceeds from our underwritten public equity offering that closed during the third quarter  the issuance of approximately  units of limited partnership interest in the partnership units valued at approximately million at the time of acquisition  the issuance of long term debt  funds drawn down on our credit facilities and cash on hand 
these acquisitions added approximately million square feet of buildings and improvements on approximately acres of land and are located in states alabama  california  florida  georgia  indiana  louisiana  maryland  new jersey  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
these properties have initial lease terms generally ranging from to years  with a weighted average initial lease term of years 
the leases  in general  have renewal options exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of to years 
results of operations comparison of to revenue rental 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions  from which we generate our rental income 
we owned properties as of december   versus properties as of december  in addition  included in rental revenue for the years ended december  and were straight lined rents totaling million and million  respectively 
the increase in rental revenue was partially offset by a decrease in lease rates on our variable rate leases 
as of december   million of our billion real estate portfolio  or  was subject to variable rate leases 
this compares to million of our billion real estate portfolio  or  that was subject to variable rate leases as of december  we had a corresponding decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt resulting in reduced interest expense  which is more fully described below 
under our variable rate lease program  rental income attributable to the leases is variable  and monthly base rent is calculated based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
of the total variable rate leases  the majority of the lease agreements contain minimum rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of such leases contain a maximum rate 
of the total amount of variable rate lease additions during  approximately million related to properties leased to sonic that were converted from fixed rate to variable rate during the third quarter of and the remaining million was from acquisitions completed during the year 
we also converted the interest rate on the underlying debt that is secured primarily by such properties from fixed rate to variable rate as discussed below 
interest and other 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on temporary investments as well as a decrease in the gain on the sale of properties  which decreased to  from  in expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase in operating expenses from the prior year is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related expenses primarily attributable to the issuance of additional stock based compensation awarded to employees  an increase in bonuses awarded  as well as an increase in the number of employees  an increase in state income taxes due to the growth of our real estate portfolio during and  and additional costs associated with our marketing and investor relations program 
the increase from prior year was partially offset by a decrease in professional services and travel costs and a  write down during the third quarter of of our investment in a start up  on line procurement solution company for the automotive retail industry 
the investment was written off because they ceased operations due to their inability to secure the capital necessary to fund their business 
interest 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to an increase in debt outstanding during that time period including mortgage debt and borrowings under our credit facilities  which was obtained primarily to fund acquisitions 
as discussed above  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt totaled million as of december  including million of variable rate debt that will become fixed rate debt effective july  pursuant to an interest rate swap arrangement  which has subsequently been extended to november  as described in the recent developments section herein 
the effective interest rate on our debt  which includes deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans  decreased from in to in debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt compared to million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt as of december  extraordinary item extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of  we converted million of fixed rate debt due september  to variable rate debt 
the debt was converted in conjunction with our conversion from fixed rate to variable rate leases relating to approximately million of property which sonic leases  as discussed above 
the new debt terms require monthly payments including interest and principal  and provide for interest at the day libor rate plus basis points versus a fixed rate of 
the conversion of the interest rate on the debt from fixed to variable resulted in a significant modification of the debt 
in accordance with gaap  the significant modification should be treated as an extinguishment of debt 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining deferred loan fees related to the fixed rate debt and classified the write off as an extraordinary item on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the extraordinary item totaled  or per basic and diluted share 
comparison of to revenue rental 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions  from which we generate our rental income 
we owned properties as of december   versus properties as of december  of which were acquired in the second half of 
in addition  included in rental revenue for the years ended december  and were straight lined rents totaling million and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we began  on a prospective basis  straight lining our rents for our leases with fixed minimum escalators 
prior to the third quarter of  we had assessed the impact of straight lining our fixed minimum escalator rental income and determined that the amounts were not material to our financial statements 
as a result  we did not straight line the impact of fixed minimum escalator rental income  but rather recorded any increases to rental income from escalators when the increased amounts were due from tenants 
during the third quarter of  we determined that  due to our growth as a result of acquisitions and the increase in the number of leases that included fixed minimum escalators  the impact of not straight lining the fixed minimum escalators would start to become material to our financial statements during the third quarter of as a result  we decided to change our policy and began straight lining the impact of the fixed minimum escalators beginning with our third quarter financial statements 
the impact of not straight lining the rent for the year ended december  and for the six months ended june  was not material to those periods  nor was the effect of the change in policy material to fiscal year for these reasons  we accounted for the change in accounting policy on a prospective basis 
interest and other 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on temporary investments 
there was a timing difference between when the funds were received on debt issued during and the closing of the acquisitions in which the funds were utilized  thereby causing excess cash on hand during part of the year 
these net proceeds were fully used during partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was an increase in the gain on the sale of properties  which increased to  from  in expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were acquired prior to and that were being depreciated over years 
during the first half of  we began undertaking a review of the estimated useful lives we were using on our real estate portfolio 
our review was completed in the third quarter of our business reasons for undertaking a review of the estimated remaining useful lives of our properties acquired prior to were as follows i we began acquiring properties during and from publicly traded automotive dealership groups and we investigated the depreciation policies of these publicly traded dealership groups and determined that many were depreciating the types of buildings and improvements that we were acquiring over periods in excess of years  and ii our tenants are continually remodeling and upgrading their dealerships to adhere to manufacturer specifications for example  the appearance of the franchised automotive dealership and we believed  and continue to believe  that the remodeling and upgrading of our properties by our tenants preserves the value of the properties to a greater extent than normal maintenance and  therefore  justifies a longer estimated useful life for the properties 
this information provided us with better insight and improved judgment with respect to approximating the remaining useful lives of the properties included in our portfolio 
furthermore  as part of our due diligence process  we generally engage third parties to perform appraisals and or structural reviews on each property 
these reports generally provide the age and the remaining estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements 
the information obtained from these reports further supported our conclusion that a longer depreciable life was warranted 
based on this analysis  it was determined that the average remaining useful life of our buildings and improvements that were acquired prior to was approximately years 
not all assets were found to have a remaining useful life of years  however 
as a result  we revised the depreciable lives on those properties whose remaining useful life approximated years to years and for those assets with a remaining useful life of less than years  we continue to depreciate the buildings and improvements over years 
the change in depreciable life is considered a change in an accounting estimate and has been recorded on a prospective basis beginning in the third quarter of this change decreased depreciation expense on the assets acquired prior to by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million  as compared to million for general and administrative expenses  excluding the write off of our  investment in bbcn  a start up on line procurement company for the automotive retail industry  decreased by approximately  or  from during  we wrote off our investment in bbcn as they ceased operations due to their inability to secure the necessary capital to fund their business 
excluding the bbcn write off  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses attributable to staffing reductions that occurred throughout and a reduction in marketing and advertising expenses 
interest 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to interest incurred for the entire year on debt issued in the second half of and interest incurred on our credit facilities and additional new debt issued in to fund acquisitions 
in addition  as a result of rising interest rates on new debt issued during  the effective interest rate including deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans of the company s outstanding debt rose from in to in interest expense also increased because of the additional costs incurred to maintain properties in our borrowing base under our short term credit facilities 
debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness compared to million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness as of december  comparison of to although we were formed prior to january   we did not complete our initial public offering ipo until february   at which time we purchased our initial properties and began generating rental income 
revenue rental 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions properties owned as of december   versus properties as of december   from which we generate our rental income 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we began  on a prospective basis  straight lining our rents for leases with fixed minimum escalators 
see the results of operations comparison of to for the basis for our change in policy 
this increased rental revenue for the year ended december  by approximately  interest and other 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for interest and other income during the year ended december  was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of the net proceeds of a private placement offering and our ipo including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option both of which were completed during the first quarter of 
these net proceeds were fully used during and therefore did not generate interest income during interest and other income during was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of debt issuance proceeds over the amount invested in properties and a  gain on the sale of properties during expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were acquired prior to that were being depreciated over years 
see the results of operations comparison of to for a description of the change in the depreciable life 
the impact of this change decreased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase is primarily due to increased payroll and related benefits attributable to personnel additions throughout and severance payments made in connection with staffing reductions during the first quarter of also contributing to the increase were increased marketing expenses as well as increased professional fees and other administrative costs associated with increased public reporting requirements 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in payroll and related expenses as a result of staffing reductions throughout and the closing of the chicago office during the second quarter of interest 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to interest charged on issued debt in late and throughout including mortgage debt and borrowings under our credit facility 
debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately of variable rate indebtedness compared to million all of which was fixed rate indebtedness as of december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended december  and were attributable to operating  investing and financing activities  as described below 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and represents  in each year  cash received primarily from rents under long term  triple net leases  plus interest and other income  less normal recurring general and administrative expenses and interest payments on debt outstanding 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and primarily reflects the acquisition of dealership properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings  net of sales of properties  during those years 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  million of proceeds received from our follow on offering  net of costs  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of other common shares  net of costs 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  distributions made to shareholders and minority partners during the year totaling million  payments of principal on outstanding mortgage debt totaling million  payments made to purchase outstanding warrants to purchase common shares totaling million  the redemption of units totaling million  and the repurchase of common shares pursuant to our common share repurchase program totaling  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of other common shares  net of costs

at the end of the third quarter  the company entered into an agreement with a third party to swap the variable rate to a fixed rate  effective july   which has subsequently been extended to november  at a fixed rate of as described in the recent developments section herein 
see interest rate swap below

the more significant debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities limit the company s debt to of assets calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation and require the company to comply with minimum debt service coverage and maximum debt to adjusted net worth ratios 
several of our loan agreements contain no financial covenants  however  there are negative covenants relating to customary items such as operation and maintenance of the properties securing the loans and limitations on issuing additional secured debt at those subsidiary levels 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities 
interest rate swap in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement was originally effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   however  during the second quarter of the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date until june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to sfas no 
 which required that all companies be in compliance with sfas no 
as of january  sfas no 
does not require restatement of financial statements from prior periods 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  there was no impact to our financial statements at the time of adoption 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million of long term debt drawn under a million commitment for secured financing from toyota financial services 
the terms of the debt provide for a year term with interest at a spread over the one month libor rate 
at the end of the third quarter  we entered into an agreement with a third party to swap the variable rate to a fixed rate  effective july   which has subsequently been extended to november  at a fixed rate of as described in the recent developments section herein 
fixing the rate of this debt with an interest rate swap continues our strategy of minimizing interest rate risk by substantially match funding our leases with debt in order to lock in our investment spread over the lease term 
the swap was designed to mirror the underlying variable rate debt in terms of index  spread  reset  amortization  compounding and maturity 
due to the identical nature of the terms of the swap and the underlying terms of the debt  we determined that the derivative instrument is highly effective 
consequently  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swap at its fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of changes in shareholders equity and other comprehensive income  and  depending on the fair value of the swap  as either a derivative instrument asset or derivative instrument liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had an unrealized gain on the swap of approximately million  which is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and accumulated other comprehensive income within our consolidated balance sheets and statements of changes in shareholders equity and other comprehensive income 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses  regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  recurring corporate expenditures  distributions to shareholders and holders of units unitholders  and amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet these requirements other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings through cash provided from operations and our existing credit facilities 
we anticipate that any additional acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings during the next months will be funded with amounts available under our existing long term debt commitments  future long term secured and unsecured debt and the issuance of common or preferred equity or units  each of which may be initially funded with our existing credit facilities 
acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings will be made subject to our investment objectives and policies with the intention of maximizing both current income and long term growth in income 
as of december   long term liquidity requirements consisted primarily of maturities under our long term debt 
we anticipate that long term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and other debt and equity financing alternatives 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions 
aggregate annual principal maturities of mortgage debt as of december  are as follows in thousands for the year ended december  thereafter total during the second quarter of  we received a commitment for million of long term secured financing from toyota financial services 
the commitment can be drawn down in multiple fundings under one or more debt instruments  and each funding is subject to customary conditions precedent and the lender s satisfaction with the loan documentation 
the terms of the commitment provide for a year term with interest at a spread over the one month libor rate 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million under this commitment to partially fund third quarter acquisitions and to repay amounts outstanding under our short term credit facilities 
as of december   we had million available under this commitment 
on august   we sold  common shares which includes the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option to purchase  common shares in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on march  the shelf registration statement 
net proceeds to the company  after deducting the discounts and commissions to the underwriters and other expenses of this offering  totaled approximately million 
after the offering  million remains available under the shelf registration statement for the issuance of securities 
the company contributed the net proceeds of the offering to the partnership in exchange for units in the partnership and the partnership used the proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of third quarter acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of  we received a commitment for a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the facility will be syndicated with five participating financial institutions including three funding sources that are new for us 
the commitment provides for a three year term with interest equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and requires the repayment of borrowings within days 
this facility is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of and will replace our existing million partially secured revolving credit facility 
we have adopted a policy to limit debt to approximately of our assets calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation 
as of december   our debt was approximately of our assets 
this policy may be changed by our board of trustees at any time without shareholder approval 
in addition  to minimize interest rate risk  we typically match the average term of our long term leases with the average term of our debt as well as the type of leases with the type of debt fixed or variable in order to maintain an investment spread over the lease term 
we describe this process as match funding 
we currently intend to match fund at least of our total outstanding long term debt with long term leases 
we may change the guideline at any time without shareholder approval 
as of december   approximately of our debt outstanding including the million of variable rate debt that will become fixed rate debt effective july  under an interest rate swap arrangement  which has subsequently been extended to november  as described in the recent developments section herein was substantially match funded  non recourse debt 
as of december   our long term debt had a weighted average remaining term of years  and our leases had a weighted average remaining term of years 
we may offer our tenants the option of utilizing our variable rate lease program 
under this program  base rent changes monthly based upon a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
in addition  the monthly base rent is typically adjusted upward periodically  usually based on a factor of the change in the cpi 
as of december   million of our billion real estate portfolio  or  was subject to variable rate leases 
of the total variable rate leases  the majority of the lease agreements contain minimum rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of such leases contain a maximum rate 
upon conversion  the fixed base rent typically continues to be adjusted upward periodically based on a factor of the change in the cpi 
these types of leases generally are or will be financed with long term  variable rate debt  thereby fixing our investment spread 
as of december   million of our total outstanding debt was variable rate debt  which includes million of variable rate debt that will become fixed rate debt effective july  under an interest rate swap arrangement  which has subsequently been extended to november  as described in the recent developments section herein 
we believe the existing mix of variable rate leases and variable rate debt maintains our balance sheet flexibility  while continuing our policy of minimizing interest rate risk 
in light of our current financial position  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing for our short term and long term liquidity requirements without exceeding our current debt to asset ratio policy 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to minimize interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available  or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us 
common share repurchase program during  we announced that our board of trustees had authorized the repurchase of up to million common shares 
purchases have been and will be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or in negotiated private transactions at the discretion of management 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
from the inception of the common share repurchase program through december   a total of  common shares have been repurchased at an average price of per common share 
in conjunction with the common share repurchases  the partnership redeemed an equivalent number of units from the company for equivalent purchase prices 
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan during april  the company implemented a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  which was subsequently amended in march the drip 
under the drip  current shareholders and unitholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all  a portion or none of their cash dividends or distributions to purchase common shares 
the drip also allows both new investors and existing shareholders and unitholders to make optional cash payments to purchase common shares 
the drip permits current shareholders  unitholders and new investors to invest a minimum of up to a maximum of  in common shares per month 
the drip also allows us to raise additional capital by waiving the limitations on the  maximum per month  as more fully described in the prospectus relating to the drip 
shares purchased under the drip through reinvestment of dividends are purchased at a discount currently 
shares purchased under the drip through optional cash payments of  or less are purchased at market price 
common shares may be purchased directly from the company or in open market or privately negotiated transactions  as we determine from time to time  to fulfill the requirements for the drip 
we issued approximately  and  common shares under the drip and received approximately and million in proceeds for the years ended december  and  respectively 
purchase of warrants outstanding to purchase common shares during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million common shares for per warrant 
the purchase price was based on the time remaining prior to exercise and the intrinsic value meaning the difference between the fair market value of the common shares and the exercise price of the warrants of the outstanding warrants at the time of the offer to purchase 
the aggregate purchase price for the warrants was approximately million  of which million was paid in and the remainder was paid in january  and was funded with debt and cash on hand 
the exercise price per share for the common shares underlying the warrants was and substantially all warrants would have expired in february the purchase of the warrants is considered a retirement of an equity instrument for gaap purposes and therefore recorded as a charge to shareholders equity 
as of december   we had warrants outstanding to acquire a total of  common shares  at an exercise price of per share 
all warrants outstanding as of december  are for terms of five years and expire no later than january funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined under the revised definition adopted in october by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss before minority interest and extraordinary item computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjusted ffo affo is ffo less straight lined rents 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
we consider ffo and affo meaningful  additional measures of operating performance because they primarily exclude the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted them as performance measures 
comparison of our presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  and affo  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
ffo and affo for the years ended december  and is computed as follows in thousands net income before minority interest real estate depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets ffo less straight lined rents affo weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute basic ffo and affo per share weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute fully diluted ffo and affo per share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
in general  our policy of substantially match funding at least of our long term debt with long term leases reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to minimize interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
we do not enter into interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
during the year ended december   our fixed rate debt decreased from million at december  to million as of december  interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
during the year ended december   our variable rate debt increased from million as of december  to million as of december  in addition  our real estate investments which are leased by tenants utilizing our variable lease rate program increased from million as of december  to million as of december  interest rate fluctuations may affect our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt as well as our annual rental income on our variable rate leases 
because the interest rates on our short term and long term variable rate debt and the base rents on our variable rate leases are based on a spread over an applicable index  the increase or decrease in interest expense as a result of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would be substantially offset by the increase or decrease in the rental income from our variable rate leases as a result of the increase or decrease in the index used to calculate the base rent 
as a result  we believe that our net income would not change substantially as a result of changes in interest rate 
therefore  we exclude the million from our total variable rate debt of million including the million of variable rate debt that will become fixed rate debt effective july  under an interest rate swap arrangement  which has subsequently been extended to november  as described in the recent developments section herein in calculating the effect of a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
it should also be noted that the majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum rates designed to protect us from a decrease in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would  however  affect the interest due on our remaining million of variable rate debt 
if interest rates on this portion of our variable rate debt had been one percentage point higher or lower  our annual interest expense relating to those debt instruments would have increased or decreased  respectively  by approximately  based on balances at december
