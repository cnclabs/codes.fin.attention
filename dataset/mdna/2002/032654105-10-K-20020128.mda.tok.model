item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net sales were  million in fiscal  a decrease of from net sales of  million in fiscal the decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve  particularly the communications market  as well as an overall decline in the general economy 
fiscal analog ic product sales decreased from fiscal our analog ic product sales were strong in the first half of the year and declined in line with a major downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the last half of fiscal our fiscal dsp ic product sales decreased from the prior year due to order cancellations and adjustments  particularly from telecommunications customers and contract manufacturers 
sales of new products  which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters  were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products 
net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of over net sales of  million in fiscal this increase in net sales was attributable to continued growth in the markets we serve 
sales into all end markets increased in fiscal with the communications market representing the largest growth area 
the percentage of sales by geographic region for the last three years is as follows region fiscal fiscal fiscal north america europe japan southeast asia as set forth above  the fiscal decline in north american sales as a percentage of total sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry 
sales to international regions remained strong in the first half of fiscal but weakened in the latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in absolute dollar terms  sales to europe increased by in fiscal sales in fiscal to japan remained relatively flat to fiscal as both a percentage of sales and in absolute dollar terms 
fiscal sales to southeast asia remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal while declining approximately in absolute dollars 
in fiscal  sales to europe declined as a percentage of total sales largely due to a weakening euro us dollar exchange rate over fiscal in absolute dollars  fiscal net sales increased over fiscal by in north america  in europe  in japan and in southeast asia 
these large sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand that was not sustainable 
gross margin was  million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  million  or of net sales  in fiscal gross margin declined by basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels  the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our internal fabs 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal to from the achieved in fiscal was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as production increased at our wafer fabrication  assembly and test facilities 
gross margin declined to in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of a sales decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development r d expense amounted to million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount were the main reason for the year over year increase 
as a result of the decline in the year to year revenue  r d spending as a percentage of sales increased to from in fiscal at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product 
table of contents leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
in fiscal  r d expense increased to million from million in fiscal amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of bco technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal  and the acquisition of thomas neuroth ag  signal processing associates pty

an additional  shares of common stock valued at a fixed amount of approximately million are issuable over the next five years upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense 
imi develops mems process designs 
on january   we acquired chiplogic  inc chiplogic of santa clara  california 
the total purchase price of million consisted of cash of approximately million  approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million and the assumption of million of outstanding chiplogic stock options 
approximately million represented the purchase price of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and was charged to operations during fiscal an additional million of cash consideration and  shares of common stock is due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as compensation expense 
of these shares   contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately million which is being charged to operations over a five year period 
the remaining  shares are subject to performance based criteria 
during fiscal  approximately million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of  shares of common stock associated with the achievement of certain of these objectives 
the remaining performance based shares had a value of approximately million as of november  to the extent that the remaining criteria are met  our stock price at that time will be used to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recoded 
chiplogic is a developer of high performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice  broadband access and network protocol processing

the total purchase price of million consisted of million in cash and the assumption of million of outstanding staccato stock options 
additional contingent cash consideration of up to million is payable if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
approximately million of the contingent consideration has been paid as of november  staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired bco technologies plc bco  a company with operations in belfast  northern ireland  in a cash for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
bco is a leading supplier of silicon on insulator wafers used for fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical switching and communications applications 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded approximately million of goodwill 
there was no in process research and development write off related to this acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired two dsp tools companies  white mountain dsp  inc of nashua  new hampshire wm and edinburgh portable compilers limited  of edinburgh  scotland epc 
the total cost of these acquisitions was approximately million with additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of million payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and operational objectives 
as of november  all of the additional cash consideration has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price 
in connection with the acquisitions of wm and epc  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development 
selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  smg a increased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result of reduced revenue levels 
in fiscal  smg a expenses increased million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  smg a decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of increased sales 
during fiscal  we recorded a special charge of approximately million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the current economic climate 
the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing  which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities 
workforce reductions also occurred  to a lesser extent  in selling  marketing and administrative areas 
as of november   the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of approximately million for approximately  employees in the us  europe  asia and the philippines  of which approximately half of these employees were terminated as of november  the special charge also included approximately million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations 
we believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately million with a million reduction in cost of sales and a million reduction in operating expenses 
the impact in fiscal of these cost savings is expected to be approximately million  with a million reduction in cost of sales and a million reduction in operating expenses 
our operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal and million  or of net sales  for fiscal in fiscal  we sold of our investment in wafertech  llc wafertech to other wafertech partners in exchange for million in cash  which was equal to of the carrying value of the equity ownership at october  during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our remaining investment in wafertech to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company for approximately million in cash 
we recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our investment in chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte 
ltd 
we received proceeds of approximately million in cash and realized a pretax gain of approximately million 
these realized gains are included in other nonoperating income 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our  million of convertible subordinated notes  which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income was due to higher cash 
table of contents balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes 
our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at for fiscal as compared to for fiscal  primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining wafertech investment 
our effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal from in fiscal due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions  principally the united states 
fiscal net income was million  or of sales  and diluted earnings per share was compared to net income in fiscal of million and diluted earnings per share of 
the fiscal decrease in net income from fiscal was primarily due to reduced revenue levels 
net income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain instruments and certain hedging activities 
fas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value 
under certain circumstances  a portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately 
while the adoption of fas on october  did not have a material impact on operations  it resulted in a million loss recognized in oci  which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal in august the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 fas  business combinations and no 
 fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under fas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we must adopt these new pronouncements no later than november  with earlier adoption permitted 
application of the non amortization provisions of fas is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million  beginning in fiscal we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and have not yet determined what effect  if any  the adoption of fas and will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
we are required to adopt fas in the first quarter of fiscal and we do not believe that the adoption of fas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions for 
table of contents the disposal of a segment of a business of apb opinion no

we are required to adopt fas in the first quarter of fiscal and we have not yet determined what effect  if any  the adoption of fas will have on our financial position or results of operations 
the impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant 
liquidity and capital resources at november   we had  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to  million at october  the million increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of million of fiscal sales offset by million of capital spending 
in fiscal  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by  million primarily due to operating cash inflows of million  or of sales in fiscal  and  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt offset by million of capital spending and million of acquisition related spending 
investing activities used  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  while financing activities generated million in fiscal and  million in fiscal accounts receivable of million at the end of fiscal decreased million or from million at the end of fiscal this decrease resulted principally from a million decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal to the fourth quarter of fiscal days sales outstanding improved from days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales  accounts receivable was at the end of fiscal  down from at the end of fiscal inventories decreased million  or  from fiscal to million at the end of fiscal days cost of sales in inventory increased by days to days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is attributable to production decreases in response to reduced demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied by external foundries 
we employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory 
although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand  due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual demand for products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods 
net additions to property  plant and equipment of million for fiscal were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
capital spending in fiscal increased slightly from the million incurred in fiscal significant fiscal capital additions included new facilities in wilmington  ma  sunnyvale  ca  and limerick  ireland 
we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal depreciation expense is expected to increase to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we acquired five companies during fiscal  as more fully described in results of operations 
total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued  million of convertible subordinated notes due notes  with semiannual interest payments on april and october of each year  commencing april  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the net proceeds of the offering were  million after payment of 
table of contents the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering  which will be amortized over the term of the notes 
after the issuance of the notes  our debt to equity ratio increased to 
at november   our principal sources of liquidity were  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with current and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future 
forward looking statements the management analysis and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
see factors that may affect future results below 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity  the risk that our backlog could decline significantly  our ability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers  changes in product mix  and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times  including the recent decline in demand experienced during fiscal our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance  depending on the mix of future business  that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets 
our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets  that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us  or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets 
also  some of our customers in these markets are less well established  which could subject us to increased credit risk 

table of contents we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive 
some of our competitors have greater technical  marketing  manufacturing and financial resources than we do 
our competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets that we serve 
our competitors have  in some cases  developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products  and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly 
we and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand in fiscal as a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third party foundries 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third party foundries  or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products 
we believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years 
this expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began in early fiscal  has led to overcapacity in our target markets  which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly test services and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard digital processes 
this reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
our capacity additions resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses 
if revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time 
we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas  which could affect the availability of supplies and services 
we  and many companies in the semiconductor industry  rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california and taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world 
this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry  including temporary loss of capacity  availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment  and availability of key services including transport 
in addition  california has recently experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity 
to date  the impact on us has been negligible 
however  electricity is a critical resource for us  without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 
during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland  the united kingdom  the philippines and taiwan 
in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry  we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the 
table of contents us economy in general  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism  particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  and the response to them of the united states and its allies 
these risks include air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates  tax and tariff rates and freight rates  and social and political unrest 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against other currencies 
we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms  we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november  for information concerning pending litigation that involves us 
an adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness 
we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on  and other amounts due in respect of  this indebtedness when due 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences 
this substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
it may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures 
it may also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we have fixed rate debt obligations and interest rate swap and cap agreements 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
because of the size and structure of these obligations  a basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material change in our interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal and fiscal the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal and fiscal due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the related interest income would change by approximately million for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for fiscal on a weighted average portfolio maturity of days 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material for fiscal due mainly to the relative insignificance of interest income to the consolidated pretax income 
as more fully described in note i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to one year 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at november  and october  currently  our largest foreign currency 
table of contents exposure is against the euro  primarily because europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november  and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
