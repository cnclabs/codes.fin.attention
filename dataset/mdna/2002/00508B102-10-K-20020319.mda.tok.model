overview we are a provider of information delivery software products and services for e 
business 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as e 
business application partners  distributors and system integrators 
e 
business application partners generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and  to a lesser extent  fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
license fee revenues from sales of software products directly to end user customers are recognized as revenues after execution of a non cancelable signed license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order and shipment of the product  provided that fees are fixed or determinable  no vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
probability of collection is based upon the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
our products do not require significant customization 
the majority of license fee revenues from sales to end user customers is from sales of specific individual products to such customers and is recognized upon shipment of the applicable product 
advance payments from end user customers  in arrangements in which the end user customer has the right to future unspecified products  are deferred and recognized as revenues ratably over the period  typically one year  during which the end user is entitled to receive the products 
such arrangements were not a significant percentage of our revenues in fiscal license arrangements with end user customers generally give the customer a perpetual license to use our software  are terminable by either party in the event of a material breach of the license agreement by the other party if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period  contain certain representations  warranties and indemnities and provisions designed to limit the parties liability under the license agreement 
license arrangements with e 
business application partners are for specified duration and require that such vendors only license our products to their customers for use with such vendor s application 
furthermore  license arrangements with distributors give such distributors the right to distribute our products to customers headquartered in specified territories 
license arrangements with indirect channel partners such as e 
business application partners  system integrators and distributors generally take the form of arrangements pursuant to which a license fee is paid to us  which we recognize as revenues when no further obligations remain  provided that the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
we have also entered into certain fixed price arrangements in which the contracting entity has the right to the unlimited usage  unspecified future products  and resale of the licensed software for a specified term and pursuant to which license fee revenues are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license agreement 
in certain situations where customers have received payment terms outside of our customary standard terms but within one year  we have recognized revenues upon delivery  provided that we have collected all payments as due under comparable arrangements  without providing concession  in the past 
we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for license sales and therefore we recognize revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method as outlined in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition 
to the extent that a discount exists on any of the elements  we follow the residual method and attribute that discount entirely to the delivered elements 
service revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from maintenance agreements  consulting and training fees 
revenues from maintenance agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis as service revenues over the term of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
service revenues from consulting and training services are recognized when performed 
to date  we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and asia pacific 
during fiscal years  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
although we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets  we cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of actuate holding  bv bv  the parent company of our distributors based in france  germany and the united kingdom 
the acquisition was accounted under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets  which are being amortized over periods not exceeding four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of bv and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of open software technology llc ost for cash and shares of actuate stock 
the acquisition was accounted under the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets  which are being amortized over periods not exceeding four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of ost and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in march  we purchased all the assets and business of enterprisesoft 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets  which are being amortized over periods not exceeding four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of enterprisesoft and the estimated fair value of assets acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of purchase 
in april  we purchased additional shares of our distributor in japan actuate japan from existing shareholders and became the majority shareholder 
we currently own of actuate japan 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill  which is being amortized over four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of actuate japan and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date we became the majority shareholder 
the excess loss applicable to the minority shareholders has been charged to us  as the minority shareholders are not obligated to contribute their share of losses exceeding their equity capital 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tidestone technologies  inc tidestone  a software technology company 
in connection with this purchase  we recorded million in goodwill and identified intangible assets  which are being amortized over periods not exceeding four years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of tidestone and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  we are required to exercise judgment in evaluating risk of concession when payments terms are beyond normal credit period of net days 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record a small provision for estimated sales returns on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenues could be overstated 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets  including goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
we periodically evaluate acquired goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performances of the acquired assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  significant impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce loss and increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
we are engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves  if any  may change in future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues costs and expenses license fees services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
restructuring total costs and expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased sales to new customers and increased follow on sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  increase in average selling prices for our products 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased sales to new customers and increased follow on sales to existing customers 
revenues from license fees from our indirect channel partners  including e 
business application partners  system integrators and distributors  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increase in demand for our professional services and an increase in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to an increase in the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
costs and expenses cost of license fees 
cost of license fees consists primarily of product packaging  documentation and production costs  and localization of our software for international distribution 
cost of license fees increased from  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal and increased to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to packaging and production costs to support increased sales 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services increased from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal and to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal was primarily due to increases in consulting personnel obtained in the ost acquisition and increased third party costs to support the growing needs of our customers 
the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of our customer service organization to support our increasing installed customer base 
we expect that cost of services will continue to grow in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to hire additional customer service personnel and consultants to support our customers demand for our services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  higher sales commissions associated with increased revenues and increased marketing program activities 
we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel  establish additional sales offices  expand international distribution channels and increase promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
research and development expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing  depreciation of capital expenditures and facilities costs 
we believe that a significant level of investment in product development is essential to maintain product leadership and anticipate research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods for developing new products and providing enhancements to current products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues were primarily due to increased personnel and related costs 
our expenses for fiscal included approximately million in facility expenses for a building that is currently unoccupied 
we will continue to evaluate our future plans for this building and other facilities 
if we reach a decision to abandon any of these facilities  we may have to accrue significant charges for the payments due under the remaining non cancelable lease terms  net of anticipated sub lease income  and for the write down in leasehold improvements and construction in progress 
such charges may be material and may involve significant use of cash if we choose to pay a settlement fee to exit any abandoned facility 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional personnel to support expanded operations 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
in connection with the acquisition of bv in june  we recognized million in goodwill and identified intangible assets 
in addition  we recognized million in goodwill and identified intangible assets in our acquisition of ost in february and million in goodwill and identified intangible assets in our acquisition of enterprisesoft in march in april  we purchased additional shares of actuate japan and became the majority shareholder 
we recognized million in goodwill as a result of consolidating actuate japan s financial statements 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tidestone and recognized million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding four years 
in fiscal years  and  we recorded amortization expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
approximately million remains to be amortized 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interest is prohibited 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new standards 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning january  however  we are still assessing the financial impact of the new standard 
during the first six months of  we will perform the required transitional impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  and have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
restructuring costs 
during the second and third quarter of fiscal  we implemented restructuring actions that resulted in aggregate charges of  the restructuring costs consisted entirely of severance payments  payroll taxes and extended medical benefits 
the restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of approximately of our worldwide workforce 
as of december   we had eliminated positions across all levels and functions 
during the year  we paid  in cash and we expect that our remaining accrual of  will be paid in the first calendar quarter of fiscal deferred compensation 
deferred compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants and also includes the unvested intrinsic value of options assumed in business combinations 
in fiscal years  and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively 
all deferred compensation expense has been included in general and administrative expenses 
at december   we had approximately  in deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
upon cancellation of the underlying stock options  the unamortized portion has been offset against additional paid in capital 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower interest income on a lower average annual investment base as we used cash to purchase ost  enterprisesoft and shares of actuate japan 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to higher cash and investment balances from which interest was earned 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million was based on pretax losses of million in fiscal the provision for income taxes of million and  was based on the pretax income of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense in fiscal represents primarily federal and state alternative minimum taxes on pretax loss as adjusted for the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization and temporary differences for which deferred tax assets cannot be recognized 
the tax expense in fiscal years and represented primarily federal and state alternative minimum taxes on pretax income before non deductible goodwill amortization  offset by the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits 
the tax expense in fiscal decreased only slightly as compared to that in fiscal even though we incurred a pretax loss in fiscal as compared to pretax income in fiscal this is primarily due to the impact of higher non deductible goodwill amortization expenses related to the acquisition of tidestone  which occurred in fiscal  and our inability to recognize a deferred tax asset for the temporary differences 
the tax expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased primarily due to higher income and non deductible goodwill amortization 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to realize deferred tax assets and we have  therefore  not recognized any net deferred tax assets at december  these factors include consideration of past operating results  the competitive nature of our market and predictability of future operating results 
we will continue to assess our ability to realize the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through approximately million in net proceeds from the private sales of preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in july  and cash from operations 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  an increase of million from million at december   and million in net working capital  an increase million from million at december  in fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in net working capital 
net cash from operating activities 
during fiscal  our operations provided net cash of million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in amortization  depreciation  tax benefits from exercise of stock options  deferred revenues and decrease in accounts receivable  which were offset by net loss  and decreases in other current assets and accounts payable 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to increases in deferred revenue  net income as adjusted for amortization and depreciation  tax benefits from exercise of stock options  accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities that were offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily due to increases in deferred revenue  net income as adjusted for amortization and depreciation and accrued compensation that were offset by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets 
cash used in investing activities 
actuate s investing activities used net cash of million dollars in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
approximately half of the cash used in investing activities during fiscal was for the purchase of property and equipment  including the furnishing of the additional office facility located adjacent to our south san francisco headquarters 
the remainder of the cash used in investing activities  net of proceeds from maturity of short term investments  was primarily for the purchase of short term investments 
by comparison  in fiscal  cash was used primarily to purchase property and equipment for our newly relocated and expanded facilities in south san francisco  and for our acquisition of ost and enterprisesoft  which was offset by proceeds from the maturity of short term investments 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million 
the cash was used primarily in the acquisition of bv and purchase of short term investments 
in connection with our acquisition of ost  we are obligated to pay million in march cash from financing activities 
cash flow from financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to cash flow from financing activities of million in fiscal  an increase of approximately  net cash provided from financing activities was million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from exercise of options under our stock option plan and from employee purchases of common stock under our stock purchase plan  offset by the open market repurchases of our stock and by the repayment of bank loan assumed in connection with the tidestone acquisition 
in fiscal and fiscal  the cash from financing activities primarily reflected the net proceeds from exercise of options under our stock option plan and from employee purchases of common stock under our stock purchase plan 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our japanese distributor  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
on september   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares or million worth of common stock under this program 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our future contractual obligations include minimum lease payments under operating leases at december   and are as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal year period thereafter 
 in addition  our future contractual obligations also include a million payment to be made in fiscal in connection with our acquisition of ost 
further  in conjunction with the signing of our office building leases  we have provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as security deposit 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in july  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interest will be prohibited 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new standards 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning january  however  we are still assessing the financial impact of the new standard 
during the first six months of  we will perform the required transitional impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
we are in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas  which will be effective for our fiscal year ending december  in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the staff of the fasb issued an announcement on the topic of income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
this announcement requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the income statement 
this announcement should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  and comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement 
we will adopt the policies outlined in the announcement beginning in we are in the process of assessing the effect of adopting this statement  which will be effective for our fiscal year ending december  risk factors that may affect future results investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing actuate 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this report on form k  including the financial statements and the notes thereto 
our operating results may be volatile and difficult to predict 
if we fail to meet our estimates of quarterly and annual operating results or we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our stock may decrease significantly 
the susceptibility of our operating results to significant fluctuations makes any prediction  including our estimates  of future operating results unreliable 
in addition  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our operating results have in the past  and may in the future  vary significantly due to factors such as the following 
demand for our products  
the size and timing of significant orders for our products  
a slow down or a decrease in spending on information technology by our current and or prospective customers  
general domestic and international economic and political conditions  
sales cycles and sales performance of our indirect channel partners  
continued successful relationships and the establishment of new relationships with e 
business application vendors  
the management and expansion of our international operations  
changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  
ability to make new products commercially available in a timely manner  
budgeting cycles of our customers  
changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  
failure to successfully manage acquisitions made by us  
defects in our products and other product quality problems  and 
failure to meet hiring needs and unexpected personnel changes 
because our software products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  total revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped throughout that quarter 
booking of orders in the third quarter of was negatively impacted by the september th terrorist attacks and future terrorists acts or war time conditions are likely to impact the booking of orders in future periods 
furthermore  several factors may require us  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  to defer recognition of license fee revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including 
whether the license agreement includes both software products that are then currently available and software products or other enhancements that are still under development  
whether the license agreement relates entirely or partly to then currently undeliverable software products  
whether the license agreement requires the performance of services that may preclude revenue recognition until successful completion of such services  and 
whether the license agreement includes acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance 
in addition  we may in the future experience fluctuations in our gross and operating margins due to changes in the mix of our domestic and international revenues  changes in the mix of our direct sales and indirect sales and changes in the mix of license revenues and service revenues  as well as changes in the mix among the indirect channels through which our products are offered 
a significant portion of our total revenues in any given quarter is derived from existing customers 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from license fees and services from existing customers  to expand our sales force and to increase the average size of our orders 
to the extent that such increases do not occur in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our expense levels and any plans for expansion  including plans to increase our sales and marketing and research and development efforts  are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues fall below our expectations and we are unable to quickly reduce our spending in response  our business  operating results and financial condition are likely to be harmed 
based upon all of the factors described above  we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  and it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in the event that operating results are below our estimates or other expectations  the price of our common stock could decline 
if we do not successfully expand our distribution channels and develop and maintain relationships with software application vendors  our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as our e 
business application partners  distributors and systems integrators 
our revenues from license fees resulting from sales through indirect channel partners were approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on the success of our sales force and in further establishing and maintaining relationships with indirect channel partners 
in particular  a significant element of our strategy is to embed our technology in products offered by software application vendors for resale or as a hosted application to such vendors customers and end users 
we intend to seek additional distribution arrangements with other software application vendors to embed our technology in their products and expect that these arrangements will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
our future success will depend on the ability of our indirect channel partners to sell and support our products 
if the sales and implementation cycles of our indirect channel partners are lengthy or variable or our e 
business application partners experience difficulties embedding our technology into their products or we fail to train the sales and customer support personnel of such indirect channel partners in a timely fashion  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
although we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to expand and develop relationships with e 
business application partners  we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relationships 
if we are unable to successfully expand these distribution channels and secure license agreements with additional e 
business application partners on commercially reasonable terms  including significant up front payments of minimum license fees  and extend existing license agreements with existing e 
business application partners on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results would be harmed 
any inability by us to maintain existing or establish new relationships with indirect channel partners  including systems integrators  or  if such efforts are successful  a failure of our revenues to increase correspondingly with expenses incurred in pursuing such relationships  would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the market for information delivery software does not grow as we expect  our business would be seriously harmed 
the market for information delivery software products is still emerging and we cannot be certain that it will continue to grow or that  even if the market does grow  businesses will purchase our products 
if the market for information delivery software products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
to date  all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our e 
reporting software and related products and services  and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and indirect channel partners about information delivery and our products 
however  if such expenditures do not enable our products to achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
because the sales cycles of our products are lengthy and variable  our quarterly results may fluctuate 
the purchase of our products by our end user customers for deployment within the customer s organization typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources  and is therefore subject to delays that are beyond our control 
these delays can arise from a customer s internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  budgetary constraints and the testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations as well as general economic and political events 
the sales cycle for an initial order of our products is typically to months and the sales cycle associated with a follow on large scale deployment of our products typically extends for another to months or longer 
we may experience longer sales cycles in the future 
additionally  sales cycles for sales of our products to e 
business application partners tend to be longer  ranging from to months or more and may involve convincing the vendor s entire organization that our products are the appropriate information delivery software for the vendor s application 
this time period does not include the sales and implementation cycles of such vendor s own products  which are typically significantly longer than our sales and implementation cycles 
certain of our customers have in the past  or may in the future  experience difficulty completing the initial implementation of our products 
any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation by our end user customers or our indirect channel partners could cause such customers to reject our software or lead to the delay or non receipt of future orders for the large scale deployment of our products 
if we fail to expand our international operations our business would be seriously harmed 
during fiscal years  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets 
in order to expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
we may make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks our business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and expand our distribution channels and professional services organization 
one of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address these issues is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following 
difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  
the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  
negative impact to our financial condition and results of operations resulting from combining the acquired company s financial condition and results of operations with our financial statements  
risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and 
the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to successfully integrate acquired companies and technologies with us could harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
our market is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
our competition comes in five principal forms 
direct competition from current or future software vendors such as business objects sa  crystal decisions a subsidiary of seagate technology  llc  and brio technology  inc  
indirect competition from vendors of business intelligence tools such as cognos  inc  microstrategy incorporated and microsoft that integrate reporting functionality with such tools  
indirect competition from e 
business software vendors such as sap and oracle  to the extent they include information delivery functionality in their applications  
competition from other e 
business software vendors and internet development tool vendors  and 
competition from the information technology departments of current or potential customers that may develop information delivery solutions internally which may be cheaper and more customized than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than we may 
also  most current and potential competitors  including companies such as oracle and microsoft  have greater name recognition and the ability to leverage a significant installed customer base 
these companies could integrate competing information delivery software with their products  resulting in a loss of market share for us 
we expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the information delivery software market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of market share  any of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to address the information delivery needs of our prospective customers 
also our current or future channel partners may have established in the past  or may in the future  establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  thereby limiting our ability to sell our products through particular distribution channels 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could harm our ability to obtain revenues from license fees from new or existing customers and service revenues from new or existing customers on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our litigation with microstrategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition in august   a lawsuit was filed in the virginia circuit court for fairfax county against us and two of our employees by microstrategy  inc the lawsuit alleges that these employees  who previously worked for microstrategy  breached their fiduciary and contractual obligations to microstrategy by  among other things  misappropriating trade secrets and confidential information and soliciting microstrategy employees 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages 
although actuate believes the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend this case vigorously the potential effects on our business  operating results and financial condition may include the following 
we could be forced to stop selling our products  
we will incur substantial litigation costs in defense of this lawsuit  
we may be required to indemnify our customers  
we may have to use significant engineering resources to redesign our products as a result of this lawsuit  
we may be required to enter into a licensing agreement with microstrategy containing terms that are unfavorable to us  
we will be forced to commit significant engineering and management resources to resolve this lawsuit 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and our business could be seriously harmed 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to support current and future releases of popular operating systems and computer programming languages  databases and e 
business software applications  to timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance  and to meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
if the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors or any change in industry standards causes customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
as a result of the complexities inherent in information delivery  major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the general availability of new or enhanced versions of our products 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to successfully develop  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements or such new products and product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
if we do not release new products and enhancements to existing products in a timely manner or if such new products and enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be seriously harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on the success of new products and enhancements to our products that we make generally available 
prior to the release of any new products or enhancements  the products must undergo a long development and testing period 
to date  the development and testing of new products and enhancements have taken longer than expected 
in the event the development and testing of new products and enhancements continue to take longer than expected  the release of new products and enhancements will be delayed 
if we fail to release new products and enhancements in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition  if such new products and enhancements do not achieve market acceptance our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
there are management and operational risks associated with our international operations that could seriously harm our business 
a substantial portion of actuate s revenue is derived from international sales 
during fiscal years  and  sales outside north america accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
international operations are subject to a number of risks  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
these risks include the following 
political and economic instability  
difficulty in managing an organization spread across many countries  
multiple and conflicting tax laws and regulations  
costs of localizing products for foreign countries  
difficulty in hiring employees in foreign countries  
trade laws and business practices favoring local competition  
dependence on local vendors  
compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  
longer sales and payment cycles  
import and export restrictions and tariffs  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection  and 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent such denomination in foreign currencies does occur  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
although we may from time to time undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure  we currently do not attempt to cover any foreign currency exposure 
if we are not successful in any future foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
to manage our growth and expansion  we need to improve and implement our internal systems  procedures and controls 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business would be seriously harmed 
our expansion in the number of employees and the scope of operations over the past few years has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
any acquisitions made by us will also put a significant strain on our management  information systems and resources 
in addition  we expect that an expansion of our international operations will lead to increased financial and administrative demands associated with managing our international operations and managing an increasing number of relationships with foreign partners and customers and expanded treasury functions to manage foreign currency risks 
our future operating results will also depend on our ability to further develop indirect channels and expand our support organization to accommodate growth in our installed base 
if we fail to manage our expansion effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in the future would seriously harm our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the efforts of certain key management  sales  marketing  customer support and research and development personnel 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  customer support and research and development personnel 
like other software companies  we face intense competition for such personnel  and we have experienced and will continue to experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
this is particularly true in the san francisco bay area  where the employment market for qualified sales  marketing  customer support and research and development personnel can be very competitive 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lose the service of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
there are risks associated with the software industry the software industry is experiencing a significant downturn in connection with the decline in general economic conditions  which has resulted in a decrease of the budgets of our customers and potential customers for information technology 
this change in economic conditions has resulted in a slowdown of the purchase of internet based software products and has affected our operating results and financial condition 
we expect this economic downturn to continue and  thus  our operating results and financial condition may be below our forecasts and investor expectations and may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of buying patterns and general economic conditions in the software industry 
if our product contains material defects  our business could be seriously harmed 
software products as complex as those offered by us often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released and when configured to individual customer computing systems 
we currently have known errors and defects in our products 
despite testing conducted by us  if additional defects and errors are found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipment  this could result in the loss of revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if a successful product liability claim is made against us  our business would be seriously harmed 
although license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that such limitation of liability provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of such claims  which are likely to be substantial in light of the use of our products in business critical applications 
a product liability claim brought against us could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate  our business could be seriously harmed 
we have two issued and two pending us patents and we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
for example  we license our software pursuant to shrink wrap or signed license agreements  which impose certain restrictions on licensees ability to utilize the software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property  including requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
if our means of protecting our proprietary rights is not adequate or our competitors independently develop similar technology  our business could be seriously harmed 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe such parties intellectual property rights 
we expect information delivery software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
the market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as the following 
changes in the economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  
terrorist attacks or war time conditions  
announcements of technological innovations  
new products or new contracts announced by us or our competitors  
litigation  
developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  
price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  
conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries  
changes in corporate purchasing of information delivery software  
the announcement of mergers or acquisitions  
adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and 
the purchase or sale of our common stock by day traders 
in addition  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain of our charter provisions and delaware law  may prevent or deter a change in control of actuate 
actuate s certificate of incorporation  as amended and restated the certificate of incorporation  and bylaws  as amended and restated bylaws  contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder might consider favorable  including provisions authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock and eliminating the ability of stockholders to act by written consent 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of actuate or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
the anti takeover effect of these provisions may also have an adverse effect on the public trading price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during fiscal years  and we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside the united states 
approximately of the revenues from our us operations are overseas sales and are denominated in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal was not material 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
