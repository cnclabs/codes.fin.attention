overview we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and for business jets 
we are also a leader in the distribution of aftermarket fasteners 
we serve virtually all major airlines and a wide variety of business jet customers and airframe manufacturers 
we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories  which include o commercial aircraft seats  including an extensive line of first class  business class  tourist class and regional aircraft seats  o a full line of aircraft food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  including coffeemakers  water boilers  beverage containers  refrigerators  freezers  chillers and ovens  o both chemical and gaseous aircraft oxygen delivery systems  o business jet and general aviation interior products  including an extensive line of executive aircraft seats  indirect overhead lighting systems  oxygen  safety and air valve products  and o a broad line of aftermarket fasteners  covering over  skus 
we design  develop and manufacture a broad range of cabin interior structures such as galleys and crew rests  and provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration and passenger to freighter conversion engineering services and component kits 
we generally derive our revenues from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and new aircraft deliveries 
we believe our large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion as of february  valued at replacement prices  gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in obtaining orders both for spare parts and for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
we have substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of our business through a number of acquisitions 
since  we have completed acquisitions  including four during fiscal  and three during fiscal for an aggregate purchase price of approximately in order to position ourselves as the preferred global supplier to our customers 
during the period from to  we acquired nine commercial aircraft cabin interior products manufacturers for approximately through these acquisitions we built worldwide market leadership positions and became the number one manufacturer for a large number of product offerings 
at the same time  we rationalized our businesses and began re engineering our operations 
we integrated the acquisitions by eliminating operating facilities and consolidating personnel at the acquired businesses  resulting in headcount reductions of approximately  employees through january during fiscal we completed six acquisitions for approximately through these acquisitions we extended our product offerings into oxygen systems and we entered three new markets 
these markets include the structural reconfiguration of passenger cabins  the conversion of passenger aircraft to freighters and the business jet cabin interiors market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we launched a series of initiatives directed towards expanding our profit margins by consolidating these operations  improving productivity  reducing costs and inventory levels and speeding production of finished products 
these actions included eliminating seven principal facilities  reducing our employment base by over  employees during fiscal and rationalizing our product offerings 
the plan also included initiatives to install company wide information technology and engineering design systems and implement lean manufacturing techniques in our remaining factories 
we recognized a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of to provide for the entire amount of the restructuring  along with costs associated with new product introductions  all of which was charged to cost of sales 
during fiscal  we restructured our seating products operations and decided to discontinue certain product and service offerings 
this product line rationalization eliminated two additional facilities 
it also resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately the total cost of this product and service line rationalization was approximately effective february  we completed the acquisition of four companies that specialize in manufacturing precision machined components and assemblies for the aerospace industry 
we acquired these businesses  alson industries  inc  tl windust machine  inc 
dmgi  inc 
and maynard precision  inc  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately in may  we acquired the outstanding common stock of nelson aero space  inc for a cash consideration of approximately in july  we acquired the outstanding common stock of denton jet interiors  inc for approximately on september   we acquired m m for a purchase price of m m is a leading distributor of aerospace fasteners 
the m m acquisition was completed by issuing to the former shareholders a total of approximately million shares of our stock  paying them in cash and assuming current liabilities of approximately we financed this acquisition through cash on hand and approximately of borrowings under our bank credit facility 
the rapid decline in industry conditions brought about by the terrorist attacks on september  caused us to implement a facility consolidation plan designed to re align our capacity and cost structure with changed conditions in the airline industry 
the facility consolidation plan includes closing five facilities and reducing workforce by approximately  employees 
we recognized a charge of to provide for the total cost of the facility consolidation plan  all of which has been included in cost of sales for the year ended february  all of the aforementioned initiatives to integrate  rationalize and restructure the businesses acquired through fiscal had an aggregate cost of approximately and have already been expensed 
these initiatives enabled us to eliminate facilities and reduce headcount by over  employees 
we believe these initiatives will enable us to substantially expand profit margins  strengthen the global business management focus on our core product categories  more effectively leveraging our resources and improve our ability to rapidly react to changing business conditions 
in conjunction with these efforts  we have also implemented a company wide information technology system  a company wide engineering system and initiated lean manufacturing techniques in our remaining facilities 
common management information and engineering systems and lean manufacturing processes across all operations  coupled with a rationalized product offering  are expected to provide us with the ongoing benefit of a generally lower cost structure  and expanding gross and operating margins 
new product development is a strategic tool for our company 
our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities 
we believe that these activities  if properly focused and managed  will protect and enhance our leadership position 
research  development and engineering spending have been approximately of sales for the past several years  and is expected to remain at that level for the foreseeable future 
we also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive 
in that regard  we have  and will continue to invest in property and equipment that enhances our productivity 
over the past two years  annual capital expenditures were approximately taking into consideration our recent capital expenditure investments  current industry conditions and the recent acquisitions  we expect that annual capital expenditures will be approximately for the next few years 
all dollar amounts in the following discussion and analysis are presented in millions of dollars  except per share amounts

results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  impact of terrorist attacks on our business the rapid decline in industry conditions brought about by the terrorist attacks on september  caused us to develop and implement a facility consolidation plan designed to re align our capacity and cost structure with changed conditions in the airline industry 
the facility consolidation plan includes closing five facilities and reducing workforce by approximately  employees 
we recognized a charge of  of which the cash portion of is primarily related to severance programs  lease termination costs and preparing facilities for disposal and sale  is related to write downs of inventory  property  plant and equipment  and is related to the impairment of certain intangible assets as a result of industry conditions and facility consolidation 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  we incurred approximately of transition costs associated with the facilities and personnel consolidation program 
the charge and transition costs have been included in cost of sales for the year ended february  consolidated results revenues were negatively impacted by the severe change in industry conditions following the terrorist attacks on september  net sales for fiscal were  which is or greater than net sales of for the comparable period in the prior year 
however  excluding revenues from acquisitions  revenues declined by approximately 
sales for each of our segments  as calculated to include and exclude acquisitions completed in fiscal are set forth in the following table fy change excluding excluding fy acquisitions fy change acquisitions commercial aircraft products business jet products 
fastener distribution sales of commercial aircraft products were or lower than sales in the prior year on a comparable basis  due to the recession in the airline industry and the further downturn in industry conditions following september  gross profit was  or of net sales for fiscal  excluding facility consolidation expenses of  as compared to or of net sales in the comparable period in the prior year 
the decline in the gross margin before such costs was primarily due to the lower revenue levels along with the mix of products sold  including the impact of a lower spares sales immediately following the september terrorist attacks 
selling  general and administrative expenses were or of net sales for fiscal as compared to or of net sales in fiscal the year over year increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from of such costs related to recent acquisitions 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively  of costs related to acquisitions we completed during each respective fiscal year 
research  development and engineering expenses were or of net sales for fiscal  as compared with or of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is primarily attributable to the timing of customer programs along with austerity measures we implemented subsequent to the september terrorist attacks 
amortization expense for fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
the year over year increase in amortization expense is due to recent acquisitions 
we are assessing the impact of sfas on our financial position and results of operations and we currently believe the recurring impact will be to reduce amortization expense by approximately annually  commencing in our fiscal we generated operating earnings of or of net sales for fiscal  excluding facility consolidation and related expenses of this was or lower than operating earnings of or of net sales during the comparable period in the prior year 
the decrease in operating earnings in the current period is primarily attributable to the lower level of revenues from our businesses following the terrorist attacks on september  interest expense  net was for fiscal  or greater than interest expense of for the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due to the larger amount of outstanding debt created by the refinancing of certain indebtedness during fiscal along with the impact of recent acquisitions 
earnings before facility consolidation and acquisition related expenses  income taxes  and extraordinary item in fiscal were  which was or lower than pretax earnings in the prior year of the lower level of revenues and facility consolidation costs during fiscal resulted in a loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of or less than pretax earnings in the prior year of income tax expense for fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
the company recorded a extraordinary item during fiscal related to the early extinguishment of certain long term debt 
net loss earnings were or per share diluted for fiscal  as compared to net earnings of or per share diluted for the prior year 
year ended february  compared with year ended february  net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or as compared to the prior year 
the year over year decrease in sales is primarily attributable to lower shipments of seating products and galley structures  as well as decisions made in the prior year to discontinue certain low margin products and services 
the decreased sales of seating and galley structures are consistent with the reduction in new aircraft deliveries in calendar as compared to calendar  and also reflect last year s problems in our seating business  which have since been resolved 
improved gross and operating profit margins were key contributors to b e s improved financial performance for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit was of net sales for fiscal gross profit was higher than fiscal gross profit of of net sales  reflecting a gross margin improvement of  basis points compared to fiscal the previous year s gross margin was adversely impacted by manufacturing problems in our seating operations 
the gross margin improvement was due to two principal factors the turnaround in our seating business and the success of our continuous improvement initiatives 
aided by our information technology investments  these initiatives are enabling us to substantially improve both quality and productivity and reduce costs  particularly in our manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales for fiscal  which was greater than the prior year amount of of net sales 
research  development and engineering expenses were of net sales for fiscal  a decrease of compared to of net sales for the previous year 
the decrease is primarily due to substantially lower spending in our seating and galley operations 
amortization expense for fiscal was of net sales as compared to of net sales in the prior year 
operating earnings  excluding acquisition related expenses and ipo costs  were of net sales for fiscal  excluding of costs related to the four recent acquisitions and the termination of advanced thermal sciences a wholly owned subsidiary initial public offering 
including such costs  operating earnings were of net sales during fiscal  as compared to of net sales in the prior year 
interest expense  net was during fiscal  or greater than interest expense of for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the company s bank borrowings 
earnings before income taxes during fiscal were excluding the acquisition related and ipo costs 
including such costs  earnings before income taxes were for fiscal compared to a loss of in the previous year 
income tax expense for fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
b e s net earnings for fiscal were  excluding the acquisition related and ipo costs 
including such costs  net earnings were  or per share basic and diluted  as compared to a net loss of or per share basic and diluted in the previous year 
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  ongoing capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our primary requirements for working capital are directly related to the level of our operations  working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventories  fluctuate with the demand for our product 
our working capital was as of february   as compared to as of february  at february   our cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to at february  this increase in cash  in part  is attributable to borrowings outstanding on our bank line of credit and the timing of our semi annual interest payments on our subordinated debt coupled with an aggressive working capital management program 
during our fourth quarter  accounts receivable decreased by approximately we hold a promissory note from thomson csf holding corporation  a subsidiary of the thales group a publicly traded french company with over billion in sales 
we are currently involved in a dispute with thales over certain terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
thomson csf holding corporation failed to make payments on the promissory notes when due  and in december we initiated arbitration proceedings against thales and its parent thomson 
these obligations to us are guaranteed by thomson csf sextant  inc the arbitration against thales and thomson is expected to be resolved during fiscal cash flows cash provided from operating activities was for fiscal and for fiscal the primary source of cash during fiscal was a net loss of offset by non cash facility consolidation charges of  charges for depreciation and amortization of  an extraordinary item of  other non cash expenses of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  a decrease in inventories and other current assets of these sources of cash were partly offset by cash used to reduce payables and accruals of in connection with financing activities  we raised approximately through a series of capital market transactions 
in april we sold of senior subordinated notes and completed a common stock offering at per share about half of the proceeds were from the sale of shares issued by the company  the other half were shares we registered on behalf of selling shareholders in fiscal acquisitions  which we completed as of february  
we also established a new line of credit during the year 
net of underwriting discounts and related costs  these transactions generated approximately of cash for the company 
we used approximately of the subordinated notes proceeds to repay debt  we used to retire some higher priced senior subordinated notes and we used another to repay our then outstanding balance under our line of credit 
we used approximately of the proceeds to complete several acquisitions during the year  we acquired nelson aero space for approximately in cash  we acquired denton jet interiors for approximately in cash and we acquired m m aerospace for approximately  the cash portion of which was the balance of the proceeds from our financing activities is included in our cash balances at february  capital spending our capital expenditures were and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year decrease in capital expenditures is primarily attributable to recently implemented austerity measures along with a reduction in spending for management information system enhancements and plant modernization 
we anticipate ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately for the next several years 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have  in the past  generally funded our capital expenditures from cash from operations and funds available to us under our bank credit facility 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand and from operations and from funds available to us under our bank credit facility 
in addition  since  we have completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately we have financed these acquisitions primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities  including our  and senior subordinated notes 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements in august  we established a new bank credit facility consisting of a revolving credit facility which expires in august the bank credit facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories and by substantially all of our other personal property 
at february   indebtedness under the existing bank credit facility consisted of revolving credit facility outstanding borrowings of bearing interest at libor plus and letters of credit aggregating approximately bearing interest at libor plus  as defined 
the bank credit facility  which requires no principal payments until  contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowing  all of which were met as of february  the interest rate margin on the bank credit facility may increase in the event of certain changes to our financial leverage ratios 
in connection with a recapitalization of the company in april  the company issued of senior subordinated notes due  pursuant to an indenture dated april   between the company and the bank of new york  as trustee  and sold the notes to merrill lynch co  credit suisse first boston  jp morgan  cibc world markets and first union securities  inc on july   the company exchanged the outstanding senior subordinated notes due with an aggregate value of principal amount for senior subordinated notes due  series b  registered under the securities act of long term debt consists principally of our newly issued senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
the of notes mature on march   the of notes mature on november  and the of notes mature on may  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness 
each of the notes  notes and notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets  all of which were met by us as of february  a breach of such covenants  or the covenants under our bank credit facility  that continues beyond any grace period can constitute a default  which can limit the ability to borrow and can give rise to a right of the lenders to terminate the applicable facility and or require immediate repayment of any outstanding debt 
contractual and other obligations the following charts reflect our contractual obligations and commercial cash commitments as of february  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us or our subsidiaries pursuant to a funding commitment 
contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations total commercial commitments letters of credit we believe that the cash flow from operations which provides us with our ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures  make scheduled payments and refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the september  terrorist attacks have severely impacted conditions in the airline industry 
accordingly  the airlines are seeking to conserve cash in part by deferring or eliminating cabin interior refurbishment programs and cancelling or deferring aircraft purchases 
this has caused a substantial contraction in our business  the extent and duration of which cannot be determined at this time 
see dependence on conditions in the airline industry 
deferred tax assets we established a valuation allowance related to the utilization of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainties that preclude us from determining that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate taxable income to realize such assets during the federal operating loss carryforward period  which begins to expire in such uncertainties include recent cumulative losses  the highly cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  risks associated with our facility consolidation plan  our high degree of financial leverage  risks associated with new product introductions  recent increases in the cost of fuel and its impact on our airline customers  and risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses 
we monitor these uncertainties  as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as we assess the necessity for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company has adopted sfas and applied its new purchase accounting requirements to the acquisition of m m aerospace 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt sfas for our fiscal year beginning february  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we are assessing but have not yet determined the impact of fully adopting sfas on our financial position and results of operations 
we currently believe the recurring impact will be to reduce amortization expense by approximately annually  commencing in fiscal in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas but expects that the provisions of sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position upon adoption 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of and will be effective on february  we are assessing the impact  if any  sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products are recorded on the date of shipment and passage of title  or if required  upon acceptance by the customer 
service revenues are recorded when services are performed 
revenues and costs under certain long term contracts are recognized using contract accounting under the percentage of completion method 
the company sells its products primarily to airlines and aircraft manufacturers worldwide  including occasional sales collateralized by letters of credit 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for estimated credit losses 
actual losses have been within management s expectations 
we apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as demonstrated during fiscal  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
long lived assets including tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy  we acquire tangible and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we continually apply judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which each of our businesses operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of all impairment tests 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then asses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of february   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating income losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

risk factors we are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline industry and a severe and prolonged downturn could negatively impact our results of operations the september terrorist attacks have severely impacted conditions in the airline industry 
for the first time in the history of commercial aviation  all domestic airlines were grounded for a period of three days 
since resuming service  most major us carriers have substantially reduced their flight schedules  parking or retiring approximately of their fleets 
the airlines have further responded by decreasing domestic airfares by approximately as compared to last year 
as a result of the double digit decline in both traffic and airfares  airline revenues for domestic carriers for the first calendar quarter of were down by industry wide workforce reductions announced by the airlines  airframe manufacturers and the related suppliers to these industries have exceeded  employees 
as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic arising from the september terrorist attacks and their aftermath  as well as other factors  such as the weakening economy  the airline industry incurred the largest loss in history in calendar  totaling in excess of billion 
accordingly  the airlines are seeking to conserve cash in part by deferring or eliminating cabin interior refurbishment programs and canceling or deferring aircraft purchases 
this will cause a substantial contraction in the company s business  the extent and duration of which cannot be determined at this time 
the company has taken swift actions to respond to the rapid change in industry conditions  including consolidating five of its principal facilities into existing facilities  reducing headcount by about  positions  or  freezing salaries and eliminating all management bonuses for fiscal our principal customers are the world s commercial airlines 
through calendar  airline company balance sheets had been substantially strengthened and their liquidity significantly enhanced over the past several years as a result of improved profitability  debt and equity financings and a closely managed fleet expansion 
however  increases in pilot and other airline wages  coupled with fuel prices and the softening of the global economy were already negatively impacting airline profitability during calendar the combined impact of the recent recession and the events of september are expected to negatively impact discretionary airline spending  including for new aircraft and cabin interior refurbishments and upgrades  is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition until such time that conditions in the industry improve 
while management has developed and begun to implement what it believes is a sound plan to counter these difficult conditions  it is not yet determinable whether its plans are adequate or will be successful 
the airline industry is also undergoing a process of consolidation and significantly increased competition 
such consolidation could result in a reduction of future aircraft orders as overlapping routes are eliminated and airlines seek greater economies through higher aircraft utilization 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and will require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service we have substantial indebtedness and  as a result  significant debt service obligations 
as of february   we had approximately aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding  representing approximately of total capitalization 
the degree of our leverage and  as a result  significant debt service obligations  could have significant consequences to purchasers or holders of our shares of common stock  including o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other general corporate requirements  o limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of those funds to fund debt service obligations  o increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and o if we are able to replace our bank credit facility  increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because borrowings under a new bank credit facility will likely be at variable interest rates 
we may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which may require us to refinance our debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is to a large extent dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
our business may not generate cash flow  and we may not be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
we have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse affect on our operations the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  including dividend payments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions 
our bank credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreements governing our indebtedness  including our indentures  could result in an event of default under our bank credit facilities  or such indentures  which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we are not certain whether we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
the airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales  or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance  which could reduce our results of operations the federal aviation administration prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components  including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products  and licenses component repair stations within the united states 
comparable agencies  such as the uk civil aviation authority and the japanese civil aviation board  regulate these matters in other countries 
if we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted  the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed 
in addition  designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming 
from time to time the faa proposes new regulations 
these new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations  when the faa first enacted technical standard order c  all seating companies were required to meet these new rules 
compliance with this rule required industry participants to spend millions of dollars on engineering  plant and equipment to comply with the regulation 
a number of smaller seating companies decided that they did not have the resources  financial or otherwise  to comply with these rules and they either sold their businesses or ceased operations 
to the extent the faa implements rule changes in the future  we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance 
there are risks associated with the implementation of our facility consolidation program  failure to integrate our combined operations successfully could lead to a loss of revenues and customers 
we have developed a comprehensive facility consolidation plan  which is designed to reduce our capacity and fixed costs consistent with current demand and anticipated demand 
this plan involves shutting five principal facilities  transferring the operations to another facility while maintaining an ongoing business for the transferred operations 
if we are not successful in implementing this plan  our costs may not be as currently anticipated  we may incur delays in delivering products to our customers  which could result in significant penalty payments to our customers and the airframe manufacturers 
while the facility consolidation program is on track as of the date of this report  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the implementation of this effort or that we will not incur liabilities as a result thereof 
the airline industry is subject to extensive health and environmental regulation  any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties we are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards  and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
in addition  we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities  or at facilities we may acquire 
we compete with a number of established companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies we compete with numerous established companies 
some of these companies  particularly in the passenger to freighter conversion business  have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
our ability to be an effective competitor will depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service 
it will also depend on our success in causing our products to be selected for installation in new aircraft  including next generation aircraft  and in avoiding product obsolescence 
our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the rapidly growing passenger to freighter conversion business will depend on our success in being selected to convert specific aircraft  our ability to maintain and enhance our engineering design  our certification and program management capabilities and our ability to effectively use our recent acquisitions to manufacture a broader range of structural components  connectors and fasteners used in this business 
if we are unable to manufacture quality products and to deliver our products on time  we may be subject to increased costs or loss of customers or orders  which could reduce our results of operations during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we experienced significant operating inefficiencies in our seating programs which resulted in delayed deliveries to customers  increased re work of seating products  claims for warranty  penalties  out of sequence charges  substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
in addition  as a result of our late customer deliveries  certain airlines diverted their seating programs to other manufacturers 
to the extent we suffer any of these inefficiencies or shortcomings in the future we will likely experience significant penalties and loss of customers 
our acquisition strategy may be less successful than we expect and therefore  our growth may be limited we intend to consider future acquisitions 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this prospectus  we have no acquisition agreements to acquire any business or assets 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire attractive companies  to effectively integrate such companies  achieve cost efficiencies and to manage these businesses as part of our company 
we will have to integrate any acquisitions into our business 
the difficulties of combining the operations  technologies and personnel of companies we acquire  including those we acquired during fiscal  into our company include o coordinating and integrating geographically separated organizations  and o integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions  increased competition and the loss of certain customers resulting from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
we will have to finance any future acquisitions 
depending upon the acquisition opportunities available  we may need to raise additional funds or arrange for additional bank financing 
we may seek such additional funds through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or bank loans 
we also intend to replace our existing bank credit facility with a new facility as soon as reasonably practicable 
issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in substantial dilution to stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us could have adverse consequences to stockholders as described above 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to make future acquisitions in accordance with our business strategy  to absorb adverse operating results  to fund capital expenditures or to respond to changing business and economic conditions may be adversely affected  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations our operations are primarily in the united states  with approximately of our sales during fiscal coming from our foreign operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands 
while the majority of our operations is based domestically  each of our facilities sells to airlines all over the world 
as a result  or more of our consolidated sales for the past three fiscal years were to airlines located outside the united states 
we have direct investments in a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries primarily in europe 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
at february   we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation amount of million in stockholders equity as a result of foreign currency adjustments  and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods 
in addition  the us dollar value of transactions based in foreign currency collections on foreign sales or payments for foreign purchases also fluctuates with exchange rates 
if in the future a substantial majority of our sales were not denominated in the currency of the country of product origin  we could face increased currency risk 
also  changes in the value of the us dollar or other currencies could result in fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the us dollar value of transactions and  as a result  our net earnings could be adversely affected 
our largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in euros and british pounds 
we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk 
however  our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where we operate 
due to our foreign operations we could be subject to such factors in the future and the impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our total assets include substantial intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets 
at february   goodwill and identified intangibles and other assets  net  represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible assets we have acquired since we may not be able to realize the value of these assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
at each balance sheet date  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of intangible assets 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities of the related business  an impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down accordingly 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge of operating earnings 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized goodwill and identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  which could be material 
as of february   we have determined that no impairment existed 
risks associated with our capital stock provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our company  even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws o classify the board of directors into three classes  with directors of each class serving for a staggered three year period  o provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors  o require at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter  amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above  o permit the board of directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board  o restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  and o contain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
such provisions would make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by the board of directors 
our board of directors has declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding 
a right will also be attached to each share of common stock subsequently issued 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects 
if triggered  the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires more than of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or other similar transaction 
under our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of any such series without stockholder approval 
the board of directors could  therefore  issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us 
in addition  under certain circumstances  section of the delaware general corporation law makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder  or generally a stockholder  to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three year period 
you may not receive cash dividends on our shares we have never paid a cash dividend and do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intended to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and to repay indebtedness 
also  our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock is restricted by covenants in our outstanding notes and bank credit facility 
if the price of our common stock continues to fluctuate significantly  you could lose all or a part of your investment since the beginning of fiscal  the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases  and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to o our quarterly operating results  o changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  o changes in our business  o changes in the market s perception of our business  o changes in the businesses  earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers  o changes in general market or economic conditions  and o changes in the legislative or regulatory environment 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of our variable rate debt 
foreign currency we have direct operations in europe that receive revenues from customers in various currencies and purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors in various currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in british pounds and euros 
from time to time  the company and its foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies 
at february   we had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts 
we did not enter into any other derivative financial instruments 
interest rates at february   we had adjustable rate debt of million and fixed rate debt of million 
the weighted average interest rate for the adjustable and fixed rate debt was approximately and  respectively  at february  if interest rates were to increase by above current rates  the estimate impact on our financial statements would be to reduce pretax income by approximately million 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of february   we maintained a portfolio of securities consisting mainly of taxable  interest bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  we estimate interest income would increase or decrease by approximately million
