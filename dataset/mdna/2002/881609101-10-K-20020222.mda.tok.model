see forward looking statements on page and risk factors and investment considerations on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
we have endeavored to provide a more thorough discussion of our expectations and goals in this section  and we anticipate that we will continue to do the same in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the future 
however  expectations and goals may change during interim periods of time 
we do not intend to  and you should not expect that we will  update the information contained herein during any such interim period 
strategy our goal is to create value by i maximizing our earnings  cash flows and return on capital by reducing costs  increasing efficiencies and optimizing existing assets and ii increasing our competitiveness by expanding our size and market presence through a combination of internal growth initiatives and selective acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and cash flows and provide significant operational synergies 
we are acquiring and developing assets that we believe will have a competitive advantage in connected markets which should lower our operating  transportation and distribution costs and provide a market penetration with competitive prices 
we consider connected markets to include markets that are connected to our refining operations by pipelines  trucks  railcars  vessels or other means of conveyance as well as markets that  while not physically connected  are joined by means of exchange supply agreements between participants in those markets 
we have a long term goal of achieving a aftertax return on capital employed 
during and  we achieved a and aftertax return on capital employed  respectively 
we are also focused on improving profitability in our refining segment by enhancing processing capabilities  strengthening our wholesale marketing activities and improving supply and transportation logistics 
our retail operations are an important component of our corporate strategy as they provide a ratable offtake for our products at higher margins than products sold at wholesale 
we are using the north dakota refinery and related assets as a platform for retail expansion in the minneapolis st 
paul market and the utah refinery to expand our proprietary supply to the eastern washington state market  offering us further retail expansion opportunities 
the marine services segment seeks to optimize existing operations through ongoing development of customer services and cost management 
as part of this strategy  we continue to assess our existing asset base to maximize returns and financial flexibility through market diversification and related acquisitions 
we are evaluating various strategic opportunities to capitalize on the value of the marine services assets  including a possible sale of all or a part of this business 
we believe the refining and marketing industry has experienced a significant level of asset redeployment and consolidation 
we have grown and taken advantage of the economies of scale from this consolidation 
we more than tripled our refining capacity in when we acquired the hawaii and washington refineries and improved our financial condition and performance through our focus on the refining and retail business 
in  with the completion of the mid continent acquisition  our asset base grew to a total of five refineries with a rated crude oil capacity of  bpd and over retail gasoline stations 
the mid continent acquisition increased our size and the scope of our operations and diversified our earnings and geographic exposure 
we believe that the mid continent acquisition will improve our ability to supply markets in areas that we had previously targeted for commercial and retail marketing expansion  including our mirastar program 
in addition  in november  we acquired retail fueling facilities  including retail stations with convenience stores and nine commercial card lock facilities  located in washington  oregon and idaho from a privately held company based in seattle  washington 
we entered into a sale and purchase agreement with ultramar inc  a subsidiary of valero energy corporation  on february   which was amended on february  we agreed to acquire the  bpd golden eagle refinery located in martinez  california along with associated retail sites throughout northern california 
this transaction  which is subject to approval by the federal trade commission and the offices of the attorneys general of the states of california and oregon as well as other customary conditions  is anticipated to close in april the purchase price for the golden eagle assets is million plus the value of inventory at closing  assumed to be million 
we intend to finance the acquisition with a combination of debt including through an amendment to our senior secured credit facility and public or private equity 
we also believe that the golden eagle assets will be immediately accretive to our earnings 
in addition to paying the purchase price for the golden eagle assets  upon the closing of the acquisition  we have agreed to assume a substantial portion of the seller s obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with the operation of the golden eagle assets 
this includes  subject to certain exceptions  certain of the seller s obligations  liabilities  costs and expenses for violations of environmental compliance matters relating to the assets  including certain known and unknown obligations  liabilities  costs and expenses arising or incurred prior to  on or after the closing date 
subject to certain conditions  we also have agreed to assume the seller s obligations pursuant to its settlement efforts with the epa concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act  except for monetary penalties  which the seller will retain 
following the closing of the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets  we also will assume and take assignment of certain of the seller s obligations and rights including certain indemnity rights arising out of or related to the agreement pursuant to which the seller purchased the refinery in the seller has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to persuade phillips to consent to this assignment 
if the seller cannot obtain a consent from phillips  the seller has agreed to provide us with a back to back indemnity that will indemnify us against any liability for which the seller is entitled to recover under the corresponding indemnity 
the seller s indemnity  however  is non recourse to the seller and is limited to amounts the seller actually receives from phillips  less any legal or other enforcement costs the seller incurs 
therefore  the indemnification that we may be entitled to receive may not be sufficient to cover any losses or damages we incur

refining improvements heavy oil conversion project our manufacturing strategy focuses on improving refinery reliability and safety  improving refining processes and controlling manufacturing costs 
we commenced a heavy oil conversion project at our washington refinery in  which will enable us to process a larger proportion of lower cost heavy crude oils  to manufacture a larger proportion of higher value gasoline  and to reduce production of lower value heavy products 
we expect to spend approximately million including capitalized interest for this project  of which million had been spent through december  the de asphalting unit  one of the major components of the heavy oil conversion project  has been in operation since late september the upgrade of the fluid catalytic cracking unit  the final major component of the heavy oil conversion project  is expected to be fully operational by the end of the first quarter of we estimate that the total heavy oil conversion project will increase annual operating profit by million to million estimated million to million in 
the actual profit to be contributed by the heavy oil conversion project is subject to several factors  including  among others  refinery throughput  market values of light and heavy refined products  availability of economic heavy feedstocks  price differentials between light and heavy crude oils and operating expenses  including fuel and utility costs 
other in addition to the heavy oil conversion project  we have implemented programs to improve refinery reliability and safety 
we have also implemented programs to control manufacturing costs by upgrading process control systems  consolidating refinery equipment purchasing and improving our ability to respond to volatile changes in the cost of utilities at the washington refinery 
retail growth as of december   our retail segment included a network of branded retail stations under the tesoro  mirastar  tesoro alaska and other brands  including tesoro owned retail gasoline stations and jobber stations third party retail distributors in the western and mid continental united states 
these numbers include over retail stations acquired in the mid continent acquisition and retail fueling facilities acquired from a seattle  washington company in november we are in the process of rebranding the exterior signage for our acquired tesoro owned stations 
we developed our mirastar brand to be used exclusively under an agreement with wal mart whereby we build and operate retail fueling facilities on parking lots of selected wal mart store locations 
our relationship with wal mart covers western states 
each of the sites under our agreement with wal mart is subject to a ground lease with a ten year primary term and two options  exercisable at our discretion  to extend a site s lease for additional terms of five years 
at december   we had mirastar stations in operation 
though dependent on wal mart to offer sites  we expect to construct an additional to stations in each of and the average cost of constructing a standard mirastar station with four fuel dispensers is approximately  the average investment in mirastar stations will increase in the future with the construction of stations having more than four fueling dispensers 
excluding acquisitions  our capital spending in the retail segment totaled million in business environment we operate in an environment where our results and cash flows are sensitive to volatile changes in energy prices 
fluctuations in the costs of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks and the price of refined products can result in changes in margins from the refining and retail segments  as prices received for refined products may not keep pace with changes in feedstock costs 
as part of our marketing program  we purchase refined products for sale to customers 
changes in price levels of crude oil and refined products can result in changes in margins on such activities 
energy prices  together with volume levels  also determine the carrying value of crude oil and refined product inventory 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories of crude oil and refined products in our refining and retail segments 
this method results in inventory carrying amounts that may be less than current values and costs of sales that more closely represent current costs 
we maintain inventories of crude oil  intermediate products and refined products  the values of which are subject to fluctuations in market prices 
in our refining and retail segments  our inventories of refinery feedstocks and refined products totaled million barrels and million barrels at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average cost of the million barrel increase  primarily due to the purchase of inventories in the mid continent acquisition on september   was per barrel 
sales that result in a reduction in lifo inventories during could have a per barrel cost of sales in excess of the current cost of sales during the average cost of our refinery feedstocks and refined product inventories as of december  was per barrel 
we may be required to write down the carrying value of this inventory if market prices for refined products decline from year end levels to a level below the average cost of these inventories 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices also influence the level of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
our marine services segment  whose customers include offshore drilling contractors and related industries  can be impacted by significant fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
the marine services segment uses the first in  first out fifo method of accounting for inventories of fuels 
changes in fuel prices can significantly affect inventory valuations and costs of sales

results of operations summary our net earnings for the year were million per basic share or per diluted share  an increase of compared to year ago net earnings of million per basic share or per diluted share 
the improvement in earnings was primarily a result of higher refined product margins  increased refining throughput  improved operating performance and incremental operating income from acquisitions 
this improvement was partially offset by expenses related to the acquisition financing and integration 
of the earnings per diluted share  our mid continent operations and other recently acquired retail operations contributed per share 
our net earnings of million compare to earnings from continuing operations of million per basic and diluted share in the earnings improvement during  as compared to  reflected a higher level of operating income resulting from higher refined product margins and increased throughput levels  partly offset by higher operating expenses 
the marine services segment s operating income reached a record level in  reflecting a recovery in sales volumes from depressed levels  as well as effective cost management 
our net earnings of million per basic share or per diluted share included results from our former exploration and production operations 
these discontinued operations contributed million to net earnings per basic share or per diluted share in  including an aftertax gain of million from the sale of these operations 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations are presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
refining segment dollars in millions except per barrel amounts revenues refined products a    crude oil resales and other total revenues    total refinery system throughput thousand bpd b gross refining margin throughput barrel pacific northwest refineries mid pacific refinery mid continent refineries total refinery system segment operating income gross refining margins after inventory changes c expenses d depreciation and amortization e segment operating income product sales thousand bpd a f gasoline and gasoline blendstocks jet fuel diesel fuel heavy oils  residual products and other total product sales dollars in millions except per barrel amounts product sales margin barrel f average sales price average costs of sales gross sales margin gross refining margins have been revised from previously reported refinery system product spread to reclassify margins from retail sales into the retail segment 
a includes intersegment sales to our retail segment at prices which approximate market of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
b throughput includes the mid continent refineries since their acquisition on september  averaged over days 
throughput averaged over the days owned by us was  bpd 
c approximates total refinery system throughput times the gross refining margin  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured 
refined product inventories totaled million barrels  million barrels and million barrels at december   and  respectively 
in  the washington refinery increased product inventory to meet demand during the turnaround in the first quarter of and inventories were rebuilt at refineries and terminals acquired from bp in september d includes manufacturing costs per throughput barrel of  and for  and  respectively 
manufacturing costs included non cash amortization of maintenance turnaround costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
manufacturing costs also include costs of internally produced fuel 
e includes manufacturing depreciation per throughput barrel of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
f sources of total product sales included products manufactured at the refineries  products drawn from inventory balances and products purchased from third parties 
gross margins on total product sales included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared to operating income for the refining segment was million in  an increase from our newly acquired operations in the mid continent contributed approximately million to segment operating income 
the increase was also driven by stronger refined product margins and higher refinery throughput from our mid pacific refinery and higher throughput levels at our pacific northwest refineries 
the improvement in our total refinery system margins was partially offset by increases in operating expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  the industry experienced the lowest spreads since  as market conditions caused significant margin erosion 
our weakest market was the pacific northwest  where our actual gross refining margin in the fourth quarter averaged per barrel  reducing this region s annual margin to per barrel compared to per barrel last year 
our mid pacific gross refining margin improved during the fourth quarter of to per barrel  increasing the region s annual margin to per barrel  compared to per barrel in the fourth quarter gross margin for our mid continent refineries declined to per barrel 
for our total refinery system  gross refining margin increased to per barrel  a increase from the per barrel in we attribute this improvement to the continued success of our efforts to optimize our refinery system and to reduce our logistics costs throughout our asset base 
while weak product demand existed in the latter part of  jet fuel margins in alaska were fairly stable  compared with  as air cargo demand was comparable to last year 
conversely  in hawaii  jet fuel demand was lower due to reduced passenger flights 
the loss of demand was largely offset by reduced imports into hawaii 
revenues from sales of refined products in the refining segment increased to  million in  from  million in  due to increased sales volumes largely offset by lower prices 
total product sales averaged  bpd in  an increase of from  while product prices dropped to per barrel 
the decrease in other revenues was primarily due to lower crude oil resales which totaled million in compared to million in the decrease in costs of sales reflected primarily lower prices for feedstocks and product supply 
gross refining margin increased to million in reflecting higher product spread and volumes 
the increase in refinery margin included contributions from the mid continent operations 
we increased refinery throughput  or  bpd  excluding the new operations  as compared to in addition  we were able to process a higher percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil  which represented of refinery throughput in  compared with in expenses  excluding depreciation  increased by to million in  primarily due to additional operating expenses from our new operations  increased throughput at our other refineries  higher costs for utilities and fuel  and increased employee costs 
depreciation and amortization increased to million  primarily due to the new operations and timing of capital improvement projects during the completion of our heavy oil conversion project at the washington refinery by the end of the first quarter of will enable us to process a larger proportion of lower cost heavy crude oils  to manufacture a larger proportion of higher volume gasoline  and to reduce production of lower value heavy products 
the de asphalting unit  one of the major components of the heavy oil conversion project  has been in operation since late september the upgrade of the fcc unit  the final major component of the heavy oil conversion project  is expected to be fully operational by the end of the first quarter of management estimates that the total heavy oil conversion project would increase annual operating income by million to million estimated million to million in 
the actual profit to be contributed by the heavy oil conversion project is subject to several factors  including  among others  refinery throughput  market values of light and heavy refined products  availability of economic heavy feedstocks  price differential between light and heavy crude oils and operating expenses 
a turnaround of certain units at the washington refinery is in progress and will be completed during the first quarter of we estimate the turnaround will cause throughput for the pacific northwest refineries to decline to about  bpd in the first quarter of  as compared to  bpd in the first quarter of compared to operating income for the refining segment increased during to million 
this improvement was driven by a combination of stronger refined product margins and higher refinery throughput 
industry product supply concerns and tight product inventories contributed to strong west coast margins 
we were able to capitalize on these conditions by operating our refineries at historically high rates 
the level of refinery throughput reflected high levels of operational reliability without compromising our safety program 
the improvement in gross refinery margins was partially offset by higher operating expenses 
revenues from sales of refined products in the refining segment increased in  primarily due to higher product prices and increases in sales volumes 
our average product sales prices increased to per barrel in from per barrel in total product sales increased to an average of  bpd during from  bpd in other revenues increased during primarily due to crude oil resales of million in compared to million in this increase in crude oil resales resulted from a term agreement with one of our crude oil suppliers 
the increase in cost of sales reflected higher costs of refinery feedstocks and purchased products due to higher prices as well as higher volumes 
our gross refining margins improved to million in from million in  reflecting a increase in refinery system gross margin to per barrel and a increase in refinery throughput to  bpd 
the improvement in refinery margins was partly due to the higher throughput levels combined with strong market conditions 
in addition  during  our refinery margins benefitted from our initiatives and focus on profit improvement programs 
in manufacturing  a flexible feedstock supply enabled us to process a higher percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil  which represented of refinery throughput in compared with in this percentage increase in heavy crude oil partly offset the impact of higher prices for refinery feedstocks  while minimally affecting our yield of light  higher value products  which declined less than 
the investment in the distillate treater  which was placed in service at the washington refinery in december  was a contributing factor in maintaining those yields 
we estimate that this investment added approximately million of incremental operating income in in marketing  we altered our gasoline blending process to market higher value carb quality blendstocks  rather than including these materials in the finished gasoline pool 
the flexibility to sell these products added an estimated million to operating income in  as compared to the values received from sales of conventional gasoline 
expenses  excluding depreciation  increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the impact of higher refinery throughput and increased costs for refinery utilities and fuel 
in addition  expenses increased for state and local taxes because of higher product values and maintenance turnaround costs 
savings associated with our cost reduction program partly offset these higher expenses 
electricity rates at the washington refinery increased from an average of per megawatt hour in to an average of per megawatt hour in including an average of per megawatt hour in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an aggregate increase in electricity costs from million in to million in expenses included non cash amortization of refinery turnaround costs of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due  in part  to the accelerated turnaround of certain refinery units 
the hawaii crude unit turnaround was moved from and combined with the september hydrocracker turnaround to avoid a temporary reduction in throughput in retail segment dollars in millions except per gallon amounts revenues fuel merchandise and other total revenues fuel sales millions of gallons fuel margin gallon merchandise margin in millions merchandise margin average number of stations during the year segment operating income gross margins fuel a merchandise and other non fuel margin total gross margins expenses depreciation and amortization segment operating income a includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market 
compared to operating income for our retail segment increased to million in  compared to a loss of million in the expansion of our tesoro owned and jobber dealer network enabled us to increase revenues and profits in our total gallons sold increased to million  while our fuel margin increased by to per gallon 
our average station count during of represents a increase from in at year end  we had branded retail sites in operation and of these sites were tesoro owned under the tesoro  mirastar  tesoro alaska and other brands 
revenues on fuel sales grew to million in  a increase from  while merchandise and other revenues increased by to million 
merchandise margin  however  as a percent of sales decreased 
with our increased number of stations  expenses increased to million and depreciation increased to million in compared to operating results for our retail segment decreased to a loss of million in compared to income of million in rising refining wholesale prices in the industry reduced retail margins in which negatively impacted our retail profit 
in addition  our operating results were negatively impacted by higher expenses as we were building our retail infrastructure and developing our retail marketing team 
expenses increased in  compared to  while total fuel volumes only increased by 
marine services segment dollars in millions revenues fuels lubricants and other services other income total revenues costs of sales gross profit expenses depreciation and amortization segment operating income sales volumes millions of gallons fuels  primarily diesel lubricants we are evaluating various strategic opportunities including a possible sale of all or a part of this business to capitalize on the value of our marine services assets 
compared to marine services operating income decreased by million during from included in was other income of million from settlement of a service contract 
excluding this income  operating income for the period improved by million  or 
higher sales volumes and service revenues experienced in the first part of contributed to this improvement 
the marine services segment is largely dependent on the volume of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the us gulf of mexico 
the significant decline in industry drilling activity negatively impacted our marine services sales and operating income in the later part of revenues decreased million during reflecting lower fuel sales prices  partly offset by higher services revenues 
the decrease in costs of sales during reflected lower prices for fuel supply 
compared to operating income for marine services improved to a record million in from million in  primarily due to higher fuel sales volumes and service revenues 
the higher fuel sales volumes and service revenues reflected increased customer exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico  compared with operating revenues increased to million in from million in  reflecting higher fuel volumes and prices  and service revenues 
the increase in cost of sales also reflected the higher fuel sales volumes and prices 
in  we realized other income of million from settlement of a service contract and million from the sale of excess real estate 
operating expenses in  as compared to  increased due mainly to the higher sales activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased million from million in this increase was partially due to higher expenses in the refining and retail segments associated with the mid continent acquisition and other growth initiatives 
corporate expenses accounted for million of the increase resulting largely from million in acquisition integration costs in  as well as higher employee costs and professional fees 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from the level 
corporate expenses were million in  compared with million in the million increase in was primarily due to higher employee costs associated with business development and growth 
interest and financing costs interest and financing costs  net of capitalized interest  were million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the additional debt we incurred in and to costs of approximately million related to acquisition financing 
lower interest rates in partially mitigated the impact of the increased debt levels 
interest and financing costs were million in  compared with million in the million decrease in primarily reflected lower borrowings 
proceeds from sales of our exploration and production operations were used to repay debt in december and in march the benefits from these debt repayments were partly offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt and additional borrowings to finance an increase in working capital 
income tax provision the income tax provision of in increased  as compared to  primarily reflecting the increase in pretax earnings 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rate was approximately in both and income taxes on continuing operations increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the higher pretax earnings from continuing operations 
our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to in from in the tax rate benefited from amendments to prior year returns 
see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information on income taxes and note e for income taxes related to discontinued operations 
discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations in of million net of income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  included million of aftertax operating results and a million aftertax gain on the sale of our exploration and production operations 
see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information related to discontinued operations 
capital resources and liquidity we operate in an environment where our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall market and economic conditions 
see forward looking statements on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
our future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and other sources of capital  will be affected by these conditions 
overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we expect our capital requirements to include non discretionary capital expenditures  working capital and debt service 
we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital requirements for existing operations 
however  we will be required to seek additional funding  including the incurrence of additional debt and equity  to finance the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets 
we have a universal shelf registration statement for debt or equity securities to be used for acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
at december   the amount available under the shelf registration was million 
as previously described  we entered into a sale and purchase agreement with ultramar  inc  a subsidiary of valero energy corporation  on february   which was amended on february  the transaction  which is subject to federal and state approvals  is anticipated to close in april under the terms of the golden eagle purchase agreement  we have paid a million earnest money deposit in february if the acquisition is not consummated by may  and the failure to close is a result of our default  including our failure to obtain the necessary financing  we will forfeit our earnest money deposit 
at closing  we will pay a purchase price of million  less our deposit  plus the value of inventory at closing  assumed to be million 
we intend to finance the acquisition with a combination of debt including an amendment to our senior secured credit facility and public or private equity

cash flow summary components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions cash flows from used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities during totaled million  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher earnings before depreciation and amortization and lower working capital requirements associated with the dramatic drop in feedstock and refined product prices at year end this increase was partially offset by increased sales activity associated with our new refinery assets in the mid continent operations 
net cash used in investing activities of million in included million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from asset sales 
net cash from financing activities of million in included net borrowings of million under the senior secured credit facility and net proceeds of million from our debt offering  partly offset by financing costs of million and preferred dividend payments of million

continuing operations provided cash flows from earnings before depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges partially offset by increased working capital requirements 
during  working capital requirements increased due to higher receivables arising in part from higher commodity prices  partially offset by corresponding changes in payables and a reduction in inventory levels 
net cash from investing activities of million in was provided by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets  primarily the exploration and production operations  partially offset by capital expenditures of million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations 
net cash used in financing activities of million in primarily represented repayments of debt of million and payments of dividends on preferred stock of million

capital expenditures during included million for the heavy oil conversion project bringing the cumulative costs spent through december  to million with million remaining to be spent in and million for our retail marketing program 
other capital spending was primarily for natural gas fueled generators which were subsequently sold for million and leased back in the fourth quarter  modernization of refinery control systems and other system upgrades 
for  our capital budget totals million including a full year of requirements for the mid continent operations  but excluding the impact of the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets and represents a lower percentage of our expected cash flows compared to the capital budget for the refining segment is million  including million of economic capital million for completing the heavy oil conversion project and million for other projects  million of sustaining capital and million of compliance capital 
our retail capital budget is million for  with our mirastar program accounting for approximately of the budget 
we estimate that we will build to additional mirastar sites during the remainder of the retail capital budget is divided between other tesoro owned stores and the expansion of our branded jobber dealer network 
we estimate that million of the total million will be discretionary capital spending  while the remaining million will be for non discretionary projects 
we plan to fund our capital program in with internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
however  the volatility of certain commodities prices could reduce our cash flows from operations 
see risk factors and investment considerations the volatility of crude oil prices  refined product prices and fuel and utility service prices may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations in item hereto 
if the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets is consummated  we expect our capital spending for would increase by approximately million  primarily for environmental  regulatory and safety matters 
we expect to fund these expenditures primarily with cash flows from operations 
major maintenance costs we completed our scheduled turnaround of the alaska refinery in the second quarter of at a cost of approximately million 
a scheduled turnaround of certain processing units  with an estimated cost of approximately million  is currently in progress at our washington refinery and will be completed during the first quarter of amortization of turnaround costs  other major maintenance projects and catalysts totaled million in we estimate refinery turnaround costs to be as follows in millions year year year year year refinery alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah total if the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets is consummated  we expect that our turnaround and catalyst costs will increase by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
long term commitments unless the context otherwise indicates  the following discussion of our long term commitments does not include any commitments we may incur as a result of the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets 
contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases of goods and services arising in the ordinary course of business  debt service requirements and operating lease commitments see notes f and o to consolidated financial statements in item 
the following table summarizes these commitments at december  in millions beyond debt and other obligations operating leases other commitments total contractual cash commitments  we lease our corporate headquarters from a limited partnership in which we own a limited partnership interest 
the initial term of the lease is years with two five year renewal options 
lease payments and operating costs paid to the partnership totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and our future commitments are included in operating leases in the table above 
we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method of accounting 
as such  the partnership s assets  primarily land and buildings  totaling approximately million and debt of approximately million are not included in our consolidated financial statements in item clean fuels and clean air capital we continue to evaluate certain new revisions to the clean air act regulations which will require a reduction in the sulfur content in gasoline by january  to meet the revised gasoline standard  we expect to make capital improvements of approximately million in the aggregate through and million in years after the epa has also announced new standards that will require a reduction in sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new diesel fuel standards will become effective on june  we expect to spend approximately million capital improvements through and million in years after to meet the new diesel fuel standards 
we expect to spend approximately million in the aggregate for additional capital improvements at our refineries through to comply with the second phase of refinery mact ii which was signed into law in january we expect that the refinery mact ii regulations will require new emission controls at certain processing units at several of our refineries 
we are currently evaluating a selection of control technologies to assure operations flexibility and compatibility with long term air emission reduction goals 
estimated capital expenditures excluding the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets described above to comply with the clean fuel and clean air act are summarized in the table below in millions 
year year year year year beyond lower sulphur gasoline alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah total for lower sulphur gasoline lower sulphur diesel alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah total for lower sulphur diesel total estimated clean fuels capital total estimated clean air capital mact ii total in addition  the golden eagle assets will require substantial expenditures to address upcoming clean fuels requirements including california regulations to phase out the use of the oxygenate known as mtbe  by the end of we expect that we will have to spend approximately million in and to complete this project 
we also expect to spend approximately million by at the golden eagle refinery to meet the ultra low sulfur diesel standards 
other environmental matters extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations govern our operations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources 
we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our own properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled million 
based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions  we believe these accruals are adequate 
in connection with the mid continent acquisition  we assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the new owner of these refineries  we are required to address issues including leak detection and repair  flaring protection and sulfur recovery unit optimization 
we estimate that we will spend an aggregate of million to comply with this consent decree 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
we anticipate that we will make additional capital improvements of approximately million in  primarily for improvements to storage tanks  tank farm secondary containment and pipelines 
during  we spent approximately million on environmental capital projects 
these amounts for and are included in capital spending discussed above 
conditions that require additional expenditures may transpire for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  retail gasoline stations operating and closed locations and petroleum product terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other state and federal requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these future expenditures 
we anticipate that  following consummation of the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets  capital expenditures addressing environmental issues at the golden eagle refinery such as controls on emission of nitrogen oxides and piping upgrades required to be made pursuant to orders from california s regional water quality control board with jurisdiction over the refinery  and requirements as a result of a pending settlement of a lawsuit by a citizens group concerning coke dust emissions from the refinery s pittsburg dock loading facility  will total approximately million during although some portion of these costs are being and will continue to be incurred by the seller of the golden eagle assets prior to the closing of the transaction  a substantial portion of the work will remain undone after the closing  the costs of which we will incur 
we will need to spend additional amounts for capital expenditures at the golden eagle refinery in subsequent years and we may choose to spend additional discretionary amounts 
for further information on environmental matters and other contingencies  see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements in item and legal proceedings in item conversion of preferred stock on july   our pies sm automatically converted into  shares of our common stock 
this conversion eliminated million in annual preferred dividend requirements 
we paid the final quarterly cash dividends on the pies sm on july  common stock share repurchase program in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under the program  we may make repurchases from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
purchases depend on price  market conditions and other factors and have been made primarily from internally generated cash flows 
we may use the stock to meet employee benefit plan requirements and other corporate purposes 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million  or an average cost per share of 
in  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  or an aggregate of approximately million  bringing the cumulative shares repurchased under the program to  preliminary first quarter and annual expectations on february   we announced that due to continued deterioration in market fundamentals and the ongoing scheduled turnaround of our washington refinery  we expect first quarter earnings to be below breakeven levels 
we believe that industry spreads are well below historical levels in all our refining regions 
industry spreads for the first seven weeks of averaged about per barrel below the average spread seen during the fourth quarter of normal seasonal factors make first quarter profitability more unpredictable  since margins for the first two months are typically weak 
march is generally the strongest month of the quarter  as gasoline demand and margins improve 
we reported that the predictability of march results are compounded by the uncertain near term seasonal demand growth and the washington turnaround that is scheduled to be completed in mid march we anticipate if the current industry margin environment persists that earnings could be below the current first call consensus of a loss of per share 
notwithstanding the uncertain first quarter outlook  we believe seasonal gasoline demand and announced industry throughput reductions will reduce inventory levels and improve margins 
while we anticipate margin improvement  we do not believe margins will be as strong as and margins levels 
with the full year benefit of the mid continent acquisition  the start up of our heavy oil project in march and the completion of the pending acquisition of the golden eagle assets  we believe that earnings per share will be stronger than the per share earned in accounting standards critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements in
