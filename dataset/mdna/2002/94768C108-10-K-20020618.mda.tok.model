overview background we are a leading provider of software and services for comprehensive end to end integration solutions 
we develop and deliver software products and provide related services that give large organizations the ability  seamlessly and in real time  to integrate disparate information resources  to connect customers  vendors and business partners with the organization and its employees  to view and manage the connected information resources  data  business processes and human workflows and to provide enterprise web services 
by deploying the webmethods integration platform  customers can reduce costs  create new revenue opportunities  strengthen relationships with customers  vendors and business partners  substantially increase supply chain efficiencies and streamline internal business processes 
in august  webmethods acquired active software  inc active in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we have combined our financial statements for prior periods as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of all prior periods presented 
fiscal overview we decreased our net loss to million in our fiscal year ended march   from million in the previous year and decreased our net cash used in operations from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during fiscal  our ability to increase software license revenue  our principal source of revenue  was significantly impacted by the slowing global economy and the decrease in spending on information technology immediately following the tragic events of september  we experienced two consecutive quarters of lower license revenue in the first half of fiscal in our first fiscal quarter ended june   license revenue declined from the prior quarter to million 
in early july  we took decisive actions to align our cost structure to meet the changing market conditions through a restructuring 
license revenue was million in the quarter ended september   a decline from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of september   the continued decline in the global economic conditions and extended sales cycles for enterprise software products 
for the quarters ended december  and march   however  license revenue increased sequentially by to million and to million  respectively 
license revenue increased by from the quarter ended september  to the quarter ended march  we believe that we were the only public independent integration software vendor to report an increase in license revenue for two consecutive quarters following september  our professional services revenue decreased in each quarter during fiscal reflecting an increase in the number of customer implementations performed by system integrators  a decrease in billable consultants  and to a lesser extent a decrease in average billing rates 
maintenance revenue grew in each quarter of fiscal reflecting the increase in our customer base and the cumulative effect of maintenance contracts which are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
we maintained our intense focus on expense management throughout fiscal in early july  we reduced our headcount by approximately  or  from our june  headcount of  the headcount reductions were across all departments with the exception of customer support positions  which were maintained in order to minimize the impact on our ability to support customers 
we sell our integration platform to global customers through our direct sales force augmented by system integrators  our relationships with application software partners  and to a lesser extent  resellers 
we license our software to customers under either a renewable term or a perpetual license 
as of march  we had over customers and as of march  we had over customers 
existing customers accounted for of our revenue as a result of their expanded use of our software 
no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal  or one customer accounted for more than of our total fiscal fourth quarter revenue and of our accounts receivable balance as of march  we believe one of our competitive differentiators is our strong partnership with application software companies and system integrators 
under our partnerships with application software vendors  the partner may resell or embed our software with their applications under limited use licenses for a license or royalty fee 
leading enterprise application software vendors with whom we have strong relationships include broadvision  i technologies  jd edwards  lawson software  sap ag and siebel systems 
during fiscal  i technologies and jd edwards began shipping the latest versions of their application suites  which rely on the webmethods integration platform for real time integration 
our application and system integrator partners actively assist us in selling the full webmethods integration platform to their customers  making us the logical choice for enterprise wide integration initiatives 
we believe our partners influenced  directly or indirectly  a substantial portion of our license revenue during fiscal  and we expect this leverage to continue 
under certain partnership arrangements  we may share license fees derived from joint selling opportunities with our partner 
in other partnership arrangements  we may pay a sales assistance fee to a partner who performs or assists in certain sales activities  and that fee usually is paid once payment from the joint customer of license fees is received 
we believe the software integration market will continue to provide opportunity for growth within the constraints of current global economic conditions 
our focus on customer success and satisfaction has resulted in an increasing number of referenceable customers and a substantial portion of our license revenue in fiscal coming from our existing customers 
we strive to provide the most comprehensive integration platform available  and will continue to invest to ensure an advantageous positioning relative to our competition resulting in recognized industry and technology leadership and increasing market share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ for these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements  which may include the sale of licenses of our software  professional services and maintenance or various combinations of each element 
we recognize revenue based on statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop modified sop by requiring revenue to be recognized using the residual method if certain conditions are met 
revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an agreement has been signed by both parties  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered element  and no other significant obligations remain 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
policies related to revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
these sources may publish new authoritative guidance which might impact current revenue recognition policies 
we continue to evaluate our revenue recognition policies as new authoritative interpretations and guidance are published  and where appropriate  may modify our revenue recognition policies 
application of our revenue recognition policy requires a review of our license and professional services agreements with customers and may require management to exercise judgment in evaluating whether delivery has occurred  payments are fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and where applicable  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements of the contract 
in the event judgment in the application of our revenue recognition policies is incorrect  the revenue recognized by webmethods could be impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments to us 
these allowances are established through analysis of the credit worthiness of each customer with a receivable balance  determined by credit reports from third parties  published or publicly available financial information  customers specific experience including payment practices and history  inquiries  and other financial information from our customers 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of private company equity investments we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment in corporate debt securities or in equity securities of private companies declined in value and that such a decline is other than temporary 
the determination of the value of the investments is based on information provided to us from the private companies such as audited financial statements  valuations based on recent sales of equity  projections  representations by management  and third party valuations if available 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying companies could result in losses or a perceived inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets upon adoption of sfas  all of our goodwill will be associated with our corporate reporting unit as we do not have multiple reporting units 
on an annual basis we will evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist by comparing the book value of our outstanding common stock to the market value of our outstanding common stock 
if the market value exceeds the book value  impairment does not exist 
if the market value is less than the book value  we will evaluate whether the condition is other than temporary based primarily on fluctuations in our stock price 
if we determine that the condition is other than temporary  we will record an impairment equal to the excess book value 
a new accounting standard that impacts goodwill was issued in fiscal see recently issued accounting pronouncements  for more information 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a tax valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

the decrease in net loss of million from fiscal to is attributable to decreases in acquisition costs and purchases of in process research and development 
this decrease was offset by lower revenue  higher operating expenses  a restructuring charge  a charge for the impairment of equity investments in private companies and a decrease in interest income

our liquidity and financial position at march  showed a increase in our cash and investments and a decrease in our working capital from the prior year 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in our accounts receivable balance and an increase in our accounts payable and accrual balances at march  as compared to march  net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in our net loss and a decrease in accounts receivable at march  this decrease is offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and an increase in other non current assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities reflects purchases of property  equipment and marketable securities  offset by proceeds from the repayment of an investment in a private company 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures consisted of purchases of operating resources to manage operations  including computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
since inception we have generally funded capital expenditures either through capital leases  the use of working capital  or bank loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these cash flows primarily reflect net cash proceeds from exercises of stock options in fiscal and and from private sales of mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred stock in fiscal in addition  we received million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the initial public offering of webmethods and our concurrent private placement in fiscal we also received million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of active software in fiscal we have a line of credit to borrow up to a maximum principal amount of  with a maturity date of july   which we expect to renew 
any borrowings under this line bear interest at the bank s prime rate per annum 
as of march   we had not borrowed against this line of credit 
in connection with the line of credit  we have a letter of credit totaling  related to an office lease 
borrowings under this line are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
interest is payable on the unpaid principal balance at the bank s prime rate 
we believe that our existing working capital and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next twenty four months 
however  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 any impairment loss identified upon adoption of this standard is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
any impairment loss incurred subsequent to initial adoption of sfas no 
is recorded as a charge to current period earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill acquired in purchase business combination completed before june   has been amortized through march   and will be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted sfas no 
on april  and had an unamortized goodwill balance of million 
the goodwill carrying value will be subject to the transition provision of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption of sfas  we will cease amortization of goodwill which will eliminate amortization expense 
we did not have an impairment charge of the unamortized goodwill balance at the time of adoption

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we maintain our funds in money market accounts  corporate bonds  commercial paper  treasury notes  and agency notes 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash deposits 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing as of march   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risks 
however  we do have an investment policy that would allow us to invest in short term and long term investments such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities 
our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty four months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of such investments at twelve months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries located in australia  england  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  korea  hong kong and singapore 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past  and there is no hedging activity on foreign currencies 
we would not experience a material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical adverse change in the price of the euro  great britain pound  singapore dollar  australian dollar  or yen against the us dollar 
consequently  we do not expect that a reduction in the value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  and the indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
