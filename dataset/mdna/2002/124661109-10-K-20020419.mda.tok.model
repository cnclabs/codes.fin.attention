item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations raw material pricing and productivity  and inflation 
o our ability to meet customer demand depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages in the future 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
o our growth objectives are largely dependent on our ability to renew our pipeline of new products and to bring these products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  successfully complete research and development projects  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  or gain market acceptance of the new products 
our growth could also be affected by new competitive products and technologies 
o as part of our strategy for growth  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions  and in the future  may make divestitures and form strategic alliances 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to us 
o our facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations 
the costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs  are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate since the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the problem  the complexity of the site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites  and the number and financial viability of other prps 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations 
o our business  results of operations and financial condition could be affected by significant pending and future litigation adverse to c d  such as  without limitation  product liability  contract and employment related claims and claims arising from any injury or damage to persons or the environment from hazardous substances used  generated or disposed of in the conduct of c d s business or that of a predecessor to the extent that c d is not indemnified for those liabilities 
see item legal proceedings 
o our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the foregoing list of important factors is not all inclusive  or necessarily stated in order of importance

no single customer of c d amounted to or more of our net sales for the year ended january  we typically sell our products with terms requiring payment in full within to days 
we warrant our battery products to perform as rated for specified periods of time  ranging from one to years  depending on the type of product and its application  in an amount that decreases over the life of the product 
the longest warranties generally are applicable to flooded standby power batteries sold by our powercom division 
backlog the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing and product mix of orders and  taking into account considerations of manufacturing capacity and flexibility  the speed with which we fill those orders 
period to period comparisons may not be meaningful 
occasionally orders may be canceled by the customer prior to shipment 
our order backlog at february  was  and at february  was  the decrease in backlog was due to softening in demand for our products 
we expect to fill virtually all of the february  backlog during fiscal manufacturing and raw materials we manufacture our products at seven domestic plants  two plants in china  and one each in the united kingdom  mexico and ireland 
we manufacture most key product lines at a single focused plant in order to optimize manufacturing efficiency  asset management and quality control 
consolidation 
in fiscal we closed our workington  united kingdom facility and transferred production to our other power electronics division facilities 
we also closed the manufacturing operations at our conshohocken  pennsylvania facility in march and now purchase products previously manufactured at this location from a third party 
we expect to close the manufacturing operations at our shannon  ireland facility by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  shifting its manufacturing to other power electronics division facilities 
we expect to continue to utilize the shannon  ireland location as a research and development center 
no facilities were closed during fiscal in fiscal we closed our costa mesa  california and agua prieta  mexico facilities

competition our products compete on the basis of o product quality and reliability  o reputation  o customer service  o delivery capability  and o technology 
we also offer competitive pricing  and we value our relationships with our customers 
in addition  we believe that we have certain competitive advantages in specific product lines 
we believe that we are one of the four largest producers of reserve power systems in north america 
in motive power  we believe that one competitor  enersys inc  has a significantly larger market share than we have 
our company  along with two other manufacturers  occupies a second tier of the motive power market in which we have a larger market share than our smaller third tier competitors 
for both reserve and motive power systems  we believe that the ability to provide a single source for design  engineering  manufacturing and service is an important element in our competitive position 
in reserve power systems  we believe we are the only major north american company that manufactures complete  integrated reserve power systems consisting of both electronics and batteries 
our other major competitors manufacture either electronics or batteries  but not both 
in motive power  all our major competitors supply integrated power systems  but only our company and one competitor manufacture both electronics and batteries 
with respect to power supplies  we believe that we are among a small group of large competitors in this fragmented industry 
when lead prices rise  certain of our competitors that own smelting operations may have lower lead costs than we have 
however  when lead prices decline  the high fixed costs associated with these operations may provide us with a cost advantage 
research and development we maintain extensive technology departments concentrating on electrochemical and electronics technologies 
we focus on o the design and development of new products  o the ongoing development and improvement of existing products  o sustaining engineering  o production engineering including quality testing and managing the expansion of production capacity  and o the evaluation of competitive products 
our research and development facilities in the united states and europe feature advanced computer aided design and testing equipment 
technology and engineering personnel coordinate all activities closely with operations  sales and marketing in order to better meet the needs of customers 
we continue to develop new products in our businesses

international sales accounted for  and of net sales for the years ended january   and  respectively 
additional financial information regarding our international sales is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see part ii  item patents and trademarks our policy is to apply for patents on new inventions and designs and actively pursue pending and future patent applications 
we believe that the growth of our business will depend primarily upon the quality of our products and our relationships with our customers  rather than the extent of our patent protection 
while we believe that patents are important to our business operations  the loss of any single or several patents would not have a material adverse effect on our company 
we regard our trademarks c d r  c d technologies r  c d technologies power solutions r  c d powercom r  dynasty r  liberty r  liberty series r  maximizer r and orion r as being of substantial value in the marketing of our products and have registered these trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office 
our trademarks also include c line tm  c line plus r  compucharge r  ferro five r  ferro r  guardian r  hyperon r  ranger r  revolution r  scout r  smartbattery r  v line r and pak r 
employees on february  we employed approximately  people 
of these employees  approximately  were employed in manufacturing and almost were employed in field sales  technology  manufacturing support  sales support  marketing and administrative activities 
our management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory 
employees in four domestic plants are represented by four different unions under collective bargaining agreements 
employees at a fifth domestic facility are represented by a union and a collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations regarding the clean up and protection of the environment  worker health and safety and the protection of third parties 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  the following o requirements relating to the handling  storage  use and disposal of lead and other hazardous materials used in manufacturing processes and solid wastes  o record keeping and periodic reporting to governmental entities regarding the use of hazardous substances and disposal of hazardous wastes  o monitoring and permitting of air and water emissions  and o monitoring and protecting workers from unpermitted exposure to hazardous substances  including lead used in our manufacturing processes 
we operate under a comprehensive environmental  health and safety compliance program  which is headed by an environmental vice president and staffed with trained environmental professionals 
as part of our program  we o prepare written environmental and health and safety practice manuals  o conduct employee training  o undertake periodic internal and external audits of our operations and environmental and health and safety programs  o practice and engage in routine sampling and monitoring of employee chemical and physical exposure levels  and o engage in sampling and monitoring of potential points of environmental emissions 
in addition  we also have installed certain pollution abatement equipment to reduce emissions of regulated pollutants into the environment 
our program monitors and seeks to resolve potential environmental liabilities that result from  or may arise from  current and historic hazardous materials handling and waste disposal practices 
we have in place a spent product recapture and recycling program for our facilities and our customers 
while we believe that we are in material compliance with the applicable environmental requirements  we have received  and in the future may receive  citations and notices from governmental regulatory authorities that certain of our operations are not in compliance with our permits or applicable environmental requirements 
occasionally we are required to pay a penalty or fine  to install control technology or to make equipment or process changes or a combination thereof as a result of the non compliance or changing regulatory requirements 
when we become aware of a non compliance or change in regulatory requirements  we take immediate steps to correct and resolve the issues 
the associated costs have not had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to maintain compliance with applicable environmental requirements  if damage to persons or the environment arises from hazardous substances used  generated or disposed of in the conduct of our business or that of our predecessors to the extent we are not indemnified therefore  we may be held liable for certain damages and for the costs of the investigation and remediation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in view of the potential financial effect such environmental liabilities could have  when we acquired the assets of our predecessor from allied in january  we secured an obligation from allied to indemnify us from undisclosed environmental liabilities resulting from conditions existing as of the closing date 
this obligation has since been assumed by allied s successor in interest  honeywell honeywell 
with the exception of four sites disclosed by allied at the time of the acquisition  allied and or honeywell has accepted indemnification responsibility for our potential liabilities at those third party owned or operated sites with respect to which we have been named as a prp by the united states environmental protection agency epa or state environmental agencies under the federal superfund law or comparable state environmental laws 
with respect to the sites not covered by the allied indemnity  based upon the most currently available information  we believe that our share of liability at these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  we accrue reserves for environmental liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and quarterly reevaluate the reserved amounts for these liabilities in view of the most current information available 
we are also aware of the existence of potential contamination at one of our properties which may require expenditures for further investigation and remediation 
at our huguenot  new york facility  fluoride contamination in an inactive lagoon exceeding the state s groundwater standards  which existed prior to our acquisition of the site  has resulted in the site being listed on the registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites maintained by the new york state department of environmental conservation 
the prior owner of the site is expected to ultimately bear some  as yet undetermined  share of the costs associated with this matter 
together with jci  we are conducting an assessment and remediation of contamination at our milwaukee  wisconsin facility  which we purchased as part of our acquisition of the specialty battery division from jci 
the majority of this project was completed by the end of fiscal under the purchase agreement with jci  we are responsible for i one half of the cost of the on site assessment and remediation  with a maximum liability of  ii any environmental liabilities at the facility that are not remediated as part of the current project and iii environmental liabilities for claims made after the fifth anniversary of the closing that arise from migration from a pre closing condition at the milwaukee facility to locations other than the milwaukee facility  but specifically excluding liabilities relating to pre closing offsite disposal 
jci has retained all other environmental liabilities  including off site assessment and remediation 
we received notification from the epa of alleged violations of permit effluent and pretreatment discharge limits at our plant in attica  indiana 
we submitted a compliance plan to the epa 
we are in active negotiations with the agency regarding the potential resolution of this matter 
with respect to each of the properties described in the preceding three paragraphs  we have accrued a reserve in our consolidated financial statements for our estimate of the potential costs and liabilities based upon currently available information 
the costs and potential liabilities associated with these matters are not  in our opinion  likely to materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are working towards iso certification of our corporate environmental management systems at our blue bell  pennsylvania headquarters 
iso is a voluntary  international standard that is intended to provide organizations with the elements of an effective environmental management system that can be integrated with other management requirements to assist with the achievement of environmental and economic goals

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal  primarily due to negative economic conditions  particularly in the telecommunications market  there was a softening in demand for our products 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal  and  the average north american producer price of lead was  
and 
per pound  respectively 
we have a long term cost containment program to maximize manufacturing efficiency 
under the program  we continue to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the cost to us of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o increases in labor productivity  o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies  and o selective price increases of our products 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

provision for income taxes net income before minority interest minority interest net income critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
litigation and environmental reserves c d is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
we also expend funds for environmental remediation of both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  specifically statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  we record a loss and establish a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands or settlements that have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other prps and their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if the loss contingency is difficult to estimate or if management s judgments turn out to be inaccurate 
if management believes no best estimate exists  the minimum loss is accrued in accordance with gaap 
valuation of long lived assets c d follows sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  lower levels of pension credit or other additional expense may be required 
inventory reserves c d adjusts the value of its obsolete and unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts c d maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserves c d provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers products and processes  c d s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  warranty replacement costs and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  warranty replacement costs or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be made 
deferred tax valuation allowance c d records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event c d were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should c d determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
revenue recognition c d recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of the agreement  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed and determinable 
accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on our experience 
while returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage these risks by using derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for trading purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
see derivative financial instruments in the summary of significant accounting policies  note  and fair value of financial instruments  note to the consolidating financial statements 
our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts 
the net market value of our debt instruments excluding capital lease obligations was  and  at january  and  respectively 
the debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest  and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts are used to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments 
we employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also eliminating possible risk related to refinancing in the fixed rate market 
the net market value of our interest rate swaps was  and at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in a and a increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in an and a decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
we calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the british pound and canadian dollar 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a change in exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards and swaps of  and  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards and swaps of  and  respectively 
the market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards and swap contracts are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
