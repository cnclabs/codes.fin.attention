table of contents the industry the united states processed food industry is generally characterized by relatively stable growth based on modest price and population increases 
we believe that fundamentals for the overall packaged food industry are favorable since these products are generally considered to be staple items purchased by consumers 
while consumption growth is predicted to be modest in the united states  we believe that certain product segments that address changing consumer needs  such as the healthy snacking and packaged produce market segments  offer opportunities for faster growth 
food producers have been impacted by two key trends affecting their retail customers consolidation and increased competitive pressures 
retailers are rationalizing costs in an effort to improve profitability 
in addition  more traditional grocers have experienced increasing competition from rapidly growing club stores  supercenters and mass merchandisers  which offer every day low prices 
this competitive pressure has further focused retailers on increasing supply chain efficiencies and decreasing working capital requirements 
in addition  club stores  supercenters and mass merchandisers generally offer a private label store brand in addition to offering the number one and number two national or regional brands in different product categories 
sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies and is driving initiatives such as category and inventory management 
food companies that offer such value added services have been able to increase shelf space  maximize distribution efficiencies  further strengthen their relationships with retailers and maintain their leadership positions 
although consumer consumption for certain processed food categories has historically been relatively stable  over the last few years retailers generally sold more products from their inventory and decreased purchases from food producers in an effort to reduce their inventory levels 
as a result  many food producers experienced reduced shipment volumes as trade customers reduced their inventory levels  which adversely affected sales  operating margins  cash flow and working capital requirements of the food producers 
branded food manufacturers typically establish pricing and lead innovation in the processed food categories in which we compete 
however  based on statistical information compiled by acnielsen  private label products collectively have the largest market shares in the vegetable and solid tomato categories 
the aggregate market share of the private label segment has remained relatively stable over the past several years in each of our principal product categories 
we believe that the private label segment has historically been fragmented among regional vegetable and tomato producers seeking to compete principally based on price 
private label products as a group represented  and of processed vegetable  major fruit  which includes cling peaches  pears and fruit cocktail mixed fruit  and solid tomato product sales  respectively  in fiscal

financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes are also required to be reclassified to comply with the statement of income display of eitf as a result  total costs of million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively  recorded as selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income were reclassified and presented as a reduction to sales included in this table 
b includes sales of the entire product line across each channel of distribution  including sales to grocery chains  club stores  supercenters  mass merchandisers and other grocery retailers  as well as our foodservice  food ingredients  export and private label businesses and military and government sales 

table of contents we compete on the basis of providing quality products to consumers as well as value added services  such as category and inventory management services  to grocery retailers 
vegetables we are the number one branded producer of processed vegetables in the united states 
our us market share in fiscal was larger than the market shares of our four largest branded competitors combined 
we view the processed retail vegetable market as consisting of two distinct categories core vegetables  and specialty 
we believe that the domestic processed vegetable industry is a mature category characterized by high household penetration 
we sell our core and specialty vegetable products under the del monte and s w brands  as well as private label to key customers 
the core vegetable category includes cut green beans  french style green beans  whole kernel and cream style corn  peas  mixed vegetables  spinach  carrots and potatoes 
we offer a no salt product line across most of our core varieties

in fiscal  we held us market shares of in green beans  in corn and in peas 
the specialty category includes asparagus  lima beans  wax beans  zucchini and seasoned corn products 
we are one of the branded market share leaders in the specialty category 
many of our specialty vegetable products are enhanced with flavors and seasonings  such as our zucchini in tomato sauce and fiesta corn  which is made with red and green peppers 
by creating value added products  we are able to price our specialty vegetables at a premium compared to our other vegetable products  which enables us to realize higher margins 
our vegetable products are sold in to ounce sizes  as well as in smaller can sizes known as buffet products  and larger sizes  known as family size 
the buffet sizes have pull top lids that can be opened without a can opener 
we also produce six  eight and twelve can multi packs  primarily sold to our club store  supercenters and mass merchandiser customers 
competitors in processed vegetables include branded and private label vegetable processors 
private label products taken as a whole command the largest share of the processed vegetable market  but their market share has remained relatively stable over the past decade 
our primary branded competitors in the market include green giant nationally  and regional brands such as freshlike  stokely and libby s 
we believe that one of our competitive advantages in the processed vegetable category derives from our proprietary seed varieties 
for example  we believe that our del monte blue lake green bean variety delivers higher yields and recovery than green bean varieties used by our competitors 
in fiscal  our vegetable products enjoyed an average premium of per item over private label products 
we purchase raw product from approximately vegetable growers located primarily in wisconsin  illinois  minnesota  washington and texas

we currently compete in five distinct industry categories major fruit  single serve fruit products  specialty fruit  fruit in glass  and pineapple 
we are the branded market share leader in the processed fruit category with market share in fiscal with single serve plastic cups and multi serve glass packaging  we have expanded our fruit products beyond our traditional canned product lines 
we 
table of contents believe the domestic processed fruit industry is a mature category characterized by high household penetration

major fruit includes cling peaches  pears and fruit cocktail mixed fruit 
we are the branded market share leader in the major fruit category with market share in fiscal our major fruit products are offered in can sizes ranging from to ounces 
single serve fruit has been a substantial sales growth area for us 
in single serve diced fruit products  such as peaches  pears and mixed fruit  we have a us market share 
we sell our single serve products under the fruit cup  fruit to go and fruit naturals brands 
we are the leading brand in specialty fruit products  which include apricots  freestone and spiced peaches  mandarin oranges  cherries  grapefruit and other citrus fruit  and tropical mixed fruit 
specialty fruits are higher margin  lower volume niche items  which benefit from del monte and s w brand recognition 
through our sunfresh brand  we have extended our specialty fruit product line into processed grapefruit and other citrus and tropical fruits 
we are the leading marketer of fruit in glass products under our orchard select and sunfresh brands 
orchard select is a premium fruit product packaged in glass primarily sold in the produce section of the grocery store 
orchard select products include peaches  pears  mixed fruit and apricots

the agreement provides pricing based on fixed margins 
tomato products we are the largest branded marketer in the solid tomato category with a us market share of in fiscal we sell our tomato products under the del monte  contadina and s w brand names 
the processed tomato category can be separated into two distinct product categories  which differ widely in terms of profitability  price sensitivity and growth potential solid tomatoes  and paste based tomato products 
processed solid tomato products include stewed  crushed  diced  chunky  wedges and puree products 
it is the fastest growing category of our tomato business and generally has higher margins than paste based tomato products 
during fiscal  our solid tomato products enjoyed an average premium of per item over private label products 
we believe that the diced tomato subcategory which also includes chunky tomatoes and tomato wedges has been growing at a substantially greater rate than the solid tomato category as a whole  as consumer preferences have trended toward more convenient cut and seasoned tomato products for meal preparation 
the solid tomato category now includes value added items  such as flavored and petite diced tomato products 
we believe that there is opportunity to increase sales of solid tomato products through line extensions that capitalize on our manufacturing and marketing expertise 
the paste based tomato category includes ketchup  tomato sauce  tomato paste and spaghetti and pizza sauces 
we market certain products under the del monte brand name using a niche marketing strategy targeted toward value conscious consumers seeking a branded  high quality product 
we also market certain products under the contadina brand name  which is an established national brand 
table of contents for italian style tomato products 
the contadina brand also targets the food service tomato market  including small restaurants that use contadina brand products such as finished spaghetti and pasta sauces

during fiscal  these sales accounted for of our total net sales 
we believe that a focused and consistent marketing strategy is critical to the growth of our business 
our marketing function includes new product development  pricing strategy  consumer promotion  advertising  publicity and package design 
we use consumer advertising  together with trade spending  to support awareness of new items and initial trial by consumers and to build recognition of the del monte  contadina  s w and sunfresh brand names 
value added services our category management software is designed to assist customers in managing an entire product category  including other branded and private label products in the same category 
customers using our category management services are able to more rapidly identify sales levels for various product categories so as to achieve an optimal product mix

we have sought to establish and strengthen our alliances with key customers by offering them sophisticated proprietary software applications to assist in managing their inventories 
these customers increasingly rely on sophisticated manufacturers  such as del monte  as they become more diverse through consolidations 
supply we own virtually no agricultural land 
each year  we buy over one million tons of fresh vegetables  fruit and tomatoes under approximately  contracts with individual growers and cooperatives located primarily in the united states 
no supplier accounts for more than of our total raw product requirements  and we do not consider our relationship with any particular raw product supplier to be material to our operations

most of our seasonal plants operate at close to full capacity during the packing season 
as of june   we operated twelve production facilities in the united states 
see item properties for a listing of production facilities 
three of our production facilities and one distribution facility are located in california 
as a result of california s energy shortages  we proactively focused on securing sufficient electric and natural gas supplies for our production needs and implemented energy reduction projects to reduce our energy usage and costs 
although california s power supplies remain unpredictable  all of our california production facilities have had the necessary energy to operate during the pack season 
we also developed operating procedures to mitigate the risk of unexpected service interruptions during some of our pack operations 
the hanford plant is connected to a high voltage transmission line that is an integral component of the service grid 
we adopted a plan to voluntarily reduce power usage at hanford by to to lessen the possibility of a total service interruption during peak operating periods

table of contents governmental regulation  environmental compliance as a manufacturer and marketer of food products  our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies  including the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture and the federal trade commission ftc  as well as state and local agencies  with respect to production processes  product attributes  packaging  labeling  storage and distribution 
under various statutes and regulations  these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety  purity and labeling 
in addition  advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the ftc  and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations  including those issued under the occupational safety and health act 
our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state and local authorities 
we seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses  and we are not aware of any instances of material non compliance 
we believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws  regulations  permits and licenses 
nevertheless  there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or requirements for necessary permits and licenses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions 
as a result of our agricultural  food processing and canning activities  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the treatment  handling  storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties 
violations or non compliance with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or civil liability against us by governmental entities or private parties 
we seek to comply at all times with all of these laws and regulations and are not aware of any instances of material non compliance 
however  we cannot predict the extent to which the enforcement of any existing or future environmental law or regulation may affect our operations 
among the environmental matters currently affecting us are the following we are conducting groundwater remediation at our stockton  california property associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination that resulted from the operations of a prior owner of the property 
we are in discussions with governmental authorities regarding remedial alternatives 
at the present time  we are unable to predict the total cost for the remediation 
further  investigation and remediation of environmental conditions may be required in the future at other properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us 
nonetheless  based on current information  we do not expect that the costs associated with the stockton  california remediation or any other potential future remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
governmental authorities and private claimants have notified us that we may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain contaminated sites  including certain third party sites at which we disposed of wastes 
we may be liable because of alleged leaks  spills  releases or disposal of certain wastes or other substances at these sites 
with respect to a majority of these sites  we have settled our liability 
based upon the information currently available  we do not expect that our liability for the remaining sites will be material 
we may receive additional claims that we are potentially liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at other sites in the future 
we spent approximately million on environmental expenditures from fiscal through fiscal  primarily related to wastewater treatment systems  settlement of environmental litigation and underground storage tank ust remediation activities 
we project that we will spend an aggregate of approximately million in fiscal and on capital projects and other expenditures in connection with environmental compliance  primarily for boiler upgrades  compliance costs related to the consolidation of our fruit and tomato processing operations and continued ust remediation activities 
we believe that our environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
working capital we maintain a revolving line of credit to fund our seasonal working capital needs 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality our working capital requirements are seasonally affected by the growing cycle of the vegetables  fruits and tomatoes we process 
our inventory position is seasonally affected by this growing cycle 
substantially all inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity of our company during the three year period ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of our company for the three year period ended june  and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general we report our financial results on a july to june fiscal year basis to coincide with our inventory production cycle  which is highly seasonal 
raw product is harvested and processed primarily in the months of june through october  during which time inventories rise to their highest levels 
at the same time  consumption of processed products declines  reflecting  in part  lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh alternatives and other factors 
this situation impacts operating results as sales volumes  revenues and profitability decline during this period 
results over the remainder of the fiscal year are affected by many factors including industry supply and our share of that supply 
see seasonality 
our processed vegetables  fruits and tomato products are generally considered staple foods 
we believe consumers purchase our products  like other basic food items  reasonably independent of economic cycles 
however  retail consolidation and competitive pressures are causing many food retailers to concentrate on increasing operating efficiencies  generating cash flow and decreasing working capital requirements 
retailers are focused on decreasing their own inventory requirements by reducing the inventory carried  implementing more sophisticated shelf management programs and consolidating their distribution centers and other infrastructures 
although consumer consumption of our products generally has remained stable  retailers have been selling more of our products from their inventory rather than purchasing from us 
as a result  the volume of our products shipped to retailers has been less than the volume of our products purchased by consumers at retailers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  trade customers reduced the inventory levels they had built earlier in preparation of possible year shortages 
this inventory reduction continued at a modest rate into fiscal and continued to a lesser extent throughout this year 
this reduction of retail inventory decreased our shipments in the short term and adversely affected our sales growth  operating margins  cash flows and working capital 
in addition  it caused us to have excess inventory 
the resulting lower sales volume also affected our ability to offset the increase in production costs experienced in fiscal because we produce the majority of our products in the summer months  we decreased our summer production of vegetables to reduce our inventory levels  which lowered our working capital requirements 
we reduced our summer production below our anticipated level of sales for fiscal  generating significant cash flows that contributed to our million prepayment of our term loan 
consistent with our strategy to generate growth through acquisitions  we consummated the acquisitions of contadina in december  sunfresh in september and s w in march the contadina acquisition solidified us as the branded market leader in the high margin processed solid tomato category and established a strong presence for us in the branded paste based tomato products category  which includes tomato paste  tomato sauce and pizza sauce 
in addition to further diversifying our revenue base  the contadina acquisition expanded our processing scale  which has resulted in production cost efficiencies 
we believe the sunfresh and s w acquisitions will also provide further cost savings through manufacturing efficiencies and growth opportunities in new markets 
we also reacquired the rights to the del monte brand in south america in august  which opened a new geographic market for our company 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we developed a plan to consolidate processing operations over a three year period 
among the facilities we acquired in connection with the contadina acquisition was a state of the art tomato processing facility at hanford  california 
we closed the arlington vegetable processing facility in august  the san jose fruit processing facility in december  the stockton fruit processing facility in september and the woodland bulk tomato paste processing facility in january we recorded special charges related to plant consolidations of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
we expect to incur ongoing costs for security  insurance  taxes and other miscellaneous caretaker expenses until these properties are sold 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  this plant consolidation plan is a major component of a capital investment program identified over five years ago 
as of june   approximately million has been capitalized for this program over the preceding five years 
we achieved cumulative cost savings of approximately million from this capital investment program 
cost savings were achieved through reduced 
table of contents headcount from closing the facilities  reduced raw product costs and freight savings  improved raw product recovery as a result of sourcing produce closer to where it is processed and reduced facility fixed costs for depreciation  maintenance  taxes and insurance due to the closure of processing facilities

financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes are also required to be reclassified to comply with the statement of income display of eitf issue no 
as a result  total costs of million and million  for the years ended june  and  respectively  recorded as selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income were reclassified and presented as a reduction to sales included in this table 
b includes sales of the entire product line across each channel of distribution  including sales to grocery chains  club stores  supercenters  mass merchandisers  and other grocery retailers  as well as our foodservice  food ingredients  export and private label businesses and military and government sales 
seasonality our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
our historical net sales have exhibited seasonality  with the second and third fiscal quarters generally having the highest net sales 
these two quarters reflect increased sales of our products during the holiday period in the united states extending from late november through december  as well as sales associated with the easter holiday 
lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh produce and other factors have historically affected net sales in the first fiscal quarter 
quarterly gross profit primarily reflects fluctuations in sales volumes and is also affected by the overall product mix 
our fruit operations have a greater percentage of annual sales and cost of products sold in the first fiscal quarter  as compared to our vegetable and tomato operations  due principally to increased sales of single serve fruit products during the back to school period 
generally  we have a greater percentage of annual sales and cost of products sold in the second and third fiscal quarters  principally due to the year end holiday season 
promotional expenses  which are presented as a reduction to net sales  tend to be greater in the first half of the fiscal year  primarily due to the back to school period and the year end holiday season  while easter is the only major holiday in the second half of the fiscal year 
the annual production volume of vegetables  fruit and tomatoes is planned based on anticipated demand for the following year 
annual production is also influenced by raw product availability related to general seasonal fluctuations primarily due to weather and overall growing conditions 

table of contents fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal is due primarily to the acquisition of the s w business million and the impact of a july retail price increase  net of the impact of higher trade promotion expenses related to the price increase 
net sales also continue to reflect the shift in sales volume from the slower growth grocery channel to the higher growth club  supercenter and mass merchandiser channel 
fiscal net sales includes the effect of million of trade promotion expenses to convert the universal product codes on contadina products resulting from the acquisition of the business in december we were required to pay retailers reshelving costs resulting from the change to del monte universal product codes 
approximately of consolidated net sales was generated by our south american businesses in both fiscal and the increase in retail sales prices contributed to a decline in the major vegetable and fruit categories in fiscal compared to fiscal we led the industry in raising our vegetable prices and were quickly followed by branded competitors and then private label 
in fruit  our price spread versus private label widened during fiscal due to the price increase and although private label prices increased  they did not fully match our price increase 
consumption of processed fruit in the grocery channel declined in fiscal versus fiscal  and the price spread versus private label contributed to consumption of our fruit products declining at a rate greater than the category 
for tomato products  our price increase followed an increase initiated by another branded competitor and followed broadly across the category 
we continued to respond to consumer trends in the single serve fruit snacking business by introducing two new fruit gel to go items in the first quarter of fiscal we also incurred trade promotion expenses to expand our distribution of our sunfresh processed citrus products acquired in fiscal the new product introductions and distribution expansion resulted in increases in trade promotion expenses of million in fiscal compared to fiscal we continue to be impacted by competitive pressure in the single serve fruit business  which has resulted  and may continue to result  in higher trade and consumer promotion expenses 
we believe the single serve fruit business is an important high growth category and we expect to continue to invest in this category 
in fiscal  our market share for vegetable products  based on case volume  was versus in the previous year 
our market share for fruit products was compared to in the previous year  and our market share for solid tomato products was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in cost of products sold was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes as a result of our initiative to reduce inventory levels  and an unfavorable sales mix 
the increase in manufacturing costs was somewhat offset by continued cost savings from capital spending initiatives 
cost of products sold includes inventory step up charges resulting from the sale of inventory on hand at acquisition for the s w and sunfresh businesses 
fiscal includes million of inventory step up charges related to the s w acquisition  and fiscal includes million of inventory step up charges related to the acquisition of both the s w and sunfresh businesses 
fiscal includes million of packaging obsolescence resulting from the conversion of universal product codes for contadina products related to the acquisition of the business 
selling  administrative and general expenses 
selling  administrative and general expenses increased by million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to lower returns on pension assets  higher information technology expense  and higher rental expense due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in december in addition  sales and marketing expenses to support the s w business and new products contributed to the increases over fiscal research and development costs of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  were included in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents special charges related to plant consolidation 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal  we incurred special charges of million in fiscal compared to special charges of million in fiscal details of the special charges are as follows year ended june  in millions severance accrual severance accrual reversal asset write off asset write down reversal ongoing fixed costs and asset removal disposal costs of dormant facilities accelerated depreciation special charges related to plant consolidation both the severance accrual and severance accrual reversal were related to the closure of the woodland facility 
asset write off was related to assets no longer used in operations at the woodland and stockton facilities 
asset write down reversal was related to a reduction of an accrual for the closure of the woodland facility  as the proceeds from the sale of the facility exceeded the original projections 
on going fixed costs and asset removal disposal costs of dormant facilities included period costs primarily incurred at the san jose  stockton and woodland facilities  as well as costs incurred for removal of fruit processing equipment to be disposed at the stockton facility 
we expect to incur ongoing costs for security  insurance  taxes and other miscellaneous caretaker expenses until these properties are sold 
special charges also included accelerated depreciation expense resulting from the effects of adjusting the assets remaining useful lives to accelerate the depreciation thereof 
merger related expenses 
in fiscal  merger related expenses included million primarily related to the proposed merger of dmc and the heinz businesses 
see recent developments and note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  for a description of the proposed merger 
in addition  part of the million merger related expenses related to a proposed alternative transaction with a third party 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances 
interest expense includes million of expense in excess of market rates due to the impact of interest rate swap agreements 
on january   we designated our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging instruments sfas  as amended by sfas and we recorded a liability of million representing the fair value of the swaps on january  interest expense includes a credit of million  reflecting a release to earnings from the million liability attributed to the january  to june  period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the interest rate swaps 
interest expense includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
loss on financial instruments 
loss on financial instruments for fiscal was million due to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps before they were designated as hedging instruments on january   as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
other income 
the million other income for fiscal consists primarily of dividend income and the reversal of an accrual of million for a contingent liability that is no longer required  offset by an accrual of million for litigation expense related to our recapitalization transaction in the million other income for fiscal was due to the reversal of an accrual for a contingent liability that is no longer required 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in the fiscal provision was due primarily to the reversal of a larger amount of valuation allowances in fiscal compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than the statutory us federal income tax 
table of contents rate due to the utilization of state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of state tax credits utilized in fiscal was smaller than the amount utilized in fiscal extraordinary item 
the extraordinary item resulted from the write off of million million net of tax of previously capitalized debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of million of our term loan in fiscal in connection with the may  refinancing  an extraordinary loss of million million net of tax was recorded in fiscal this extraordinary loss consisted of million of prepayment premiums and a million write off of previously capitalized deferred issuance costs and original issue discount 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal primarily reflects the acquisition of the s w and sunfresh businesses million  an increase in non retail channel sales and lower promotional expense for new products 
sales for fiscal were impacted by a reduction in inventory levels by our customers  which resulted in a reduction of shipments of products 
although consumer consumption remained relatively stable  we believe retailers have sold more out of inventory on hand rather than purchasing product 
as a result of this trend  our shipments decreased in the short term affecting sales growth  operating margins  cash flow and working capital 
the resulting lower sales volume also affected our ability to offset the increase in production costs for fiscal approximately and of consolidated net sales were generated by our south american businesses in fiscal and  respectively 
promotional expense was lower in fiscal due to fewer new product introductions than fiscal in fiscal  new product introductions were limited to fruit to go line extensions 
in fiscal  we introduced nationally the new fruit to go line of fruit in single serve plastic cups along with new flavors of diced tomatoes and new sizes of ketchup 
in addition  lower spending in fiscal for tomato products resulted from a change in trade promotion strategy on selected tomato products to focus trade promotion spending on more efficient and less costly promotion types 
in fiscal  our market share for vegetables products  based on case volume  was versus in the previous year 
our market share for fruit products was compared to for the previous year  and our market share for solid tomato products was in fiscal compared to in the fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased by million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in cost of products sold in fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of the s w and sunfresh businesses 
in addition  an unfavorable sales mix  together with increased manufacturing costs in due to lower production volumes and higher fruit production costs contributed to the increase in cost of products sold 
these increases in manufacturing costs were somewhat offset by continued cost savings from capital spending initiatives 
cost of products sold includes million of packaging obsolescence in fiscal resulting from the conversion of universal product codes for contadina products related to the acquisition of the business in december in addition  fiscal includes million of inventory step up charges resulting from the sale of inventory acquired in the s w and sunfresh acquisitions 
selling  administrative and general expense 
selling  administrative and general expense increased by million  or  compared to fiscal  due primarily to additional sales and marketing expenses to support the s w and sunfresh businesses 
in addition  fiscal includes the recapture of million of a previously recorded impairment in value of a closed production facility  resulting from contributing this facility to a joint venture real estate development 
research and development costs of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  were included in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents special charges related to plant consolidation 
we incurred special charges of million in fiscal compared to special charges of million in fiscal details of the special charges are as follows year ended june  in millions severance accrual severance accrual reversal asset write off asset write down reversal ongoing fixed costs and asset removal disposal costs of dormant facilities accelerated depreciation special charges related to plant consolidation both the severance accrual and severance accrual reversal were related to the closure of the woodland and arlington facilities 
asset write off was related to assets no longer used in operations at the woodland and stockton facilities 
asset write down reversal was related to a reduction of an accrual for the closure of the arlington facility  as the proceeds from the sale of the facility exceeded the original projections 
on going fixed costs and asset removal disposal costs of dormant facilities included period costs primarily incurred at the modesto and woodland facilities  as well as costs incurred for removal of fruit processing equipment to be disposed at the stockton and san jose facilities 
special charges also included accelerated depreciation expense resulting from the effects of adjusting the assets remaining useful lives to accelerate the depreciation thereof 
interest expense 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was due to the higher average outstanding debt balances 
interest expense includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
other income 
the million other income for fiscal was due to the reversal of an accrual for a contingent liability that was no longer required 
there was no other income expense for fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes changed from a benefit of million in fiscal to a provision of million in fiscal the change was mainly due to the million release of the valuation allowance in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate due to the utilization of state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
extraordinary item 
in connection with the may  refinancing  an extraordinary loss of million million net of tax was recorded in fiscal this extraordinary loss consisted of million of prepayment premiums and a million write off of previously capitalized deferred issuance costs and original issue discount

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to trade promotions  coupon redemption  retirement benefits  retained insurance liabilities and intangibles and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this form k 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
trade promotions trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of our products  and are critical to the support of our business 
trade promotion costs include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of our products to consumers  amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores  and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores 
accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on expected levels of performance 
settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to us 
as a result  the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by our customers for amounts they consider due to them 
final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time 
coupon redemption we offer coupons to consumers in the normal course of business 
coupon redemption costs are accrued in the period in which the coupons are offered  based on estimates of redemption rates that are developed by independent coupon redemption clearing houses based on historical information 
should actual redemption rates vary from amounts estimated  adjustments to accruals may be required 
retirement benefits we sponsor non contributory defined benefit pension plans and unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans providing certain medical  dental and life insurance benefits to eligible retired  salaried  non union hourly and union employees 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to these plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate  
table of contents withdrawal and mortality rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter mortality of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of retirement benefit expense recorded by us in future periods 
retained insurance liabilities we retain liabilities up to million million effective july  per claim under our loss sensitive worker s compensation insurance policy 
for our general and automobile insurance policy  we retain liabilities up to million per claim 
an independent  third party actuary estimates the outstanding retained insurance liabilities by projecting incurred losses to their ultimate liability and subtracting amounts paid to date to obtain the remaining liabilities 
actuarial estimates of ultimate liability are based on actual incurred losses  estimates of incurred but not yet reported losses based on historical information from both our company and the industry  and the projected costs to resolve these losses 
retained insurance liabilities may differ based on new events or circumstances that might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these losses 
intangible and long lived assets intangible assets consist of trademarks and distribution rights 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on july   intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually  by comparing the carrying value with the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 
estimated fair value is determined using various valuation methods  including the relief from royalty method and the residual income method 
in estimating discounted future cash flows  management uses historical financial information in addition to assumptions of sales trends and profitability  consistent with our performance and industry trends 
estimates of fair value may differ if projected cash flows  market interest rates and discount factors change as a result of new events or circumstances 
we review long lived assets held and used  intangible assets with finite useful lives and assets held for sale for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation of recoverability is required  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment charge is required 
all long lived assets for which management has committed to a plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
changes in projected cash flows generated by an asset based on new events or circumstances may indicate a change in fair value and require a new evaluation of recoverability of the asset 
liquidity and capital resources del monte s primary cash requirements are to fund debt service  finance seasonal working capital needs and make capital expenditures 
internally generated funds and amounts available under its revolving credit facility which provides for a million line of credit the revolver  described in financing activities below  are our primary sources of liquidity 
our ability to fund our cash requirements and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow 
these are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that cash flows from operations and availability under the revolver will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
in addition  following the closing of the proposed merger and the financing described below under the heading proposed financing  we believe that cash flows from operations and availability under the new bank facility will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least months following the merger 
on june   del monte and heinz entered into the merger agreement under which we expect to acquire the heinz businesses by merging del monte corporation with and into skf foods 
see recent developments and note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  for a description of the proposed merger 
we believe merger related costs will require a significant use of cash 
as of june   we had incurred million of merger related expenses  including expenses related to a proposed alternative transaction with a third party 
as of june   million of the million had been paid  the remainder is expected to be paid during fiscal if the amount of certain merger related expenses we incur exceeds million in aggregate  heinz is entitled to receive an amount equal to three times the excess of our merger related expenses over million 
heinz may elect to have this amount paid by having del monte pay directly or reimburse heinz for certain heinz s merger related expenses  increasing the amount of debt to be incurred by skf foods prior to the spin off of skf foods to the heinz shareholders  the proceeds of which shall be subsequently distributed to heinz or by a combination of and above

noncancelable future minimum payments under the agreement with electronic data systems corporation to provide information services functions and support 
on december   we entered into a ten year operating lease to rent our principal administrative headquarters in san francisco  california 
payments under the terms of the lease are based on scheduled monthly base rents and an escalation of rent based on an annual estimate of the increase of our share of property taxes and building operating expenses 
the lease provides two consecutive five year renewal options at the end of the lease term 
a standby letter of credit of million is in place as security deposit for the lease 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table above 
in november  we entered into a build to suit lease arrangement to finance the construction of four warehouse facilities the facilities adjacent to our hanford  kingsburg and modesto  california  and plymouth  indiana production plants 
the construction of the facilities was financed by a special purpose entity sponsored by certain lending institutions the lenders 
the special purpose entity is not affiliated with us and is not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  as amended 
the initial lease term runs until november monthly lease payments are based on libor  plus a credit spread  applied to a million lease balance 
future minimum lease payments  assuming exercise of the purchase option available to us under the lease  are included in the table above 
the lease contains various affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants based upon our financial performance 
a default under the lease  including violation of these covenants  could require an acceleration of our payment obligations 
as of june   we believe we are in compliance with these covenants 
following the initial lease term  and with required prior notice  we must exercise one of the following end of term options  each with respect to all  but not less than all  of the facilities i renew the lease for up to five additional one year terms  subject to the consent of the lenders  ii purchase the facilities for the purchase amount ie the lease balance plus accrued and unpaid rent plus any other amounts due and payable or iii sell the facilities  on behalf of the special purpose entity  to an unrelated third party 
in the event option iii is elected  we have provided a residual value guarantee of up to approximately million for any deficiency if 
table of contents the proceeds from the sale of the facilities are less than the lease balance 
however  we are entitled to any sale proceeds from a sale of the facilities in excess of the lease balance 
on june   we entered into a twenty year operating lease to rent warehouse space adjacent to production facilities located in toppenish  washington  mendota  illinois  plover  wisconsin and yakima  washington 
payments under the terms of the lease are based on scheduled monthly base rents adjusted for inflation every six years

a standby letter of credit of million is in place as security deposit for the lease 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table above 
commercial commitments lines of credit 
the working capital position of our company is seasonally affected by the growing cycle of the vegetables  fruit and tomatoes we process 
substantially all inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  working capital requirements fluctuate significantly 
we use funds from the revolver  which provides for a million line of credit  to finance the seasonal working capital needs of our operations 
the maximum availability of the revolver is subject to an asset based borrowing base 
there was no outstanding balance on the revolver at june  net availability under the revolver  adjusted for borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit  at june  totaled million 
the revolver expires on may  standby letters of credit 
we have standby letters of credit for certain operating leases  insurance related requirements and our south america operations 
the majority of the standby letters of credit are renewed automatically each year unless cancellation notice is given in advance by the issuer 
at june   a balance of million was outstanding on these letters of credit 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to favorable working capital changes 
one of our continuing objectives in fiscal was to reduce debt levels 
we reduced our summer production below our anticipated level of sales for fiscal  generating significant cash flows that contributed to our million prepayment of our term loan 
our inventories  as of june   were million lower than they were at the same time last year 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was million 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million 
the change was primarily due to lower production of inventories during fiscal  as well as the depletion of inventories that were built up in preparation for possible year shortages 
investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to the impact of the sunfresh and s w acquisitions in fiscal and lower capital expenditures of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these acquisitions 
cash used in investing activities increased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the acquisitions of the s w and sunfresh businesses in fiscal the increase was offset by million spent on the acquisition of the cambria  wisconsin plant and higher capital expenditures of million in fiscal 
table of contents total capital expenditures incurred for the years ended june   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we plan an aggregate of approximately million in capital expenditures for fiscal details of the types of capital expenditures  which include purchases of land  new and used equipment fixtures  information technology equipment  installation labor  and capitalized software development costs  are as follows year ended june  in millions capability improvement program and information systems equipment replacement and other improvements economic return and cost savings environmental compliance plant consolidation total capital expenditures capability improvement program and information systems 
in june  we began implementing a capability improvement program to upgrade information systems and business processes 
the enterprise resource planning system and advanced planning system are components of this seven phase program which is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year in addition  purchases of information technology equipment  both related and unrelated to the capability improvement program  and other capitalized software are included under this type of capital expenditure 
at june  and  we had million and million of construction in progress related to the capability improvement program and other information system projects 
we estimate we will incur approximately million of capital expenditures of this type in fiscal equipment replacement and other improvements 
this type of capital expenditure includes normal replacement of equipment at the end of its economic life  and other improvements including purchases of land  furniture and fixtures 
economic return and cost savings 
this type of capital expenditure includes projects that realize economic benefit or cost savings by installing equipment that allows facilities to operate more efficiently 
projects that require purchases of equipment to expand capacity for new products or product line extensions are also included in this category of expenditure 
environmental compliance 
this type of capital expenditure includes projects that enable us to improve the impact of our operations on the environment  consistent with our standards and regulatory compliance 
plant consolidation 
this type of expenditure is part of our california cannery consolidation  under which we expanded our operations in hanford and modesto to provide additional processing capacity to effect the closure of facilities located in san jose  stockton and woodland 
we had no significant construction in progress related to our plant consolidation program at june  at june   we had approximately million of construction in progress related to our plant consolidation program 
in addition to capital expenditures  we enter into operating leases to support our ongoing operations 
the decision to lease  rather than purchase  an asset is the result of a number of considerations including the cost of funds  the useful life of the asset  its residual value and technological obsolescence 
additionally  some equipment is proprietary to the lessor and cannot be purchased 
all material asset financing decisions include an evaluation of the potential impact of the financing on our debt agreements  including applicable financial covenants 
rent expense  including contingent rent expense calculated based on usage of equipment  was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 

table of contents financing activities activity cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was million 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million 
the change was due primarily to the million prepayment of the term loan as well as the absence of long term borrowings in fiscal in addition  we had lower working capital financing requirements in fiscal than the prior year  as explained above 
net availability under the revolver  adjusted for borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit  at june  totaled million 
unused lines of credit outside the united states at june  totaled million 
subject to various terms and conditions  we currently anticipate that financing in an aggregate amount of up to billion for the spin off and the merger will be in the form of a new bank facility consisting of a tranche a term loan in the amount of million  a tranche b term loan in the amount of million and a million revolving credit facility  and debt securities with an aggregate principal amount currently expected to be million 
see proposed financing under management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition liquidity for a further description of the proposed financing of the spin off and merger 
on september   we launched an exchange offer under which our outstanding senior subordinated notes could be exchanged for series b senior subordinated notes registered under the securities act of the exchange offer was completed and expired on october  all holders of the notes participated in the exchange and all of the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for series b senior subordinated notes 
financing activities activity on may   we refinanced our outstanding debt 
in connection with this refinancing  we repaid amounts outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility and term loans governed by the then existing second amended and restated credit agreement the agreement dated january  concurrently  we amended and restated the terms and conditions of the agreement to create a third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may  which established the revolver with a million aggregate commitment amount and a term loan the term loan in an initial funded amount of million 
the new credit agreement provides for additional borrowing capacity up to million under either the revolver or term loan 
the refinancing also included the issuance of new senior subordinated notes due the new notes in an amount of million  which provided proceeds used by del monte to a redeem its then outstanding senior subordinated notes due and dmfc s outstanding senior discount notes due  b repay the revolver and term loan balances then outstanding under the agreement  and c pay fees and expenses of the may  refinancing 
the refinancing also established new financial covenants reflecting changes in our debt structure and our financial performance 
the revolver expires on may   and the term loan matures on march  in connection with the repayment of debt at may   an extraordinary loss of million million net of tax was recorded 
this extraordinary loss consisted of million of prepayment premiums and a million write off of previously capitalized deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discount 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the incidental costs relating to the may refinancing 
net availability under the revolving credit agreement  adjusted for borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit  at june  totaled million 
unused lines of credit outside the united states at june  totaled million 
financing activities activity on january   we amended our senior credit agreement with respect to our then effective revolver and term loan facility 
the amendment provided for additional borrowing capacity up to million under either the revolver or term loan facility 
under this provision  we increased our term loan borrowings by million in august the proceeds of this borrowing were used to reduce the revolver balance 
the amendment also adjusted certain financial covenants to reflect changes in our recent positive 
table of contents financial performance 
the amendment did not change the revolver s expiration date  the term loan maturity dates or the terms of the pricing schedule 
the amendment allowed the prepayment of up to million of senior subordinated notes 
during february  we repurchased million of senior subordinated notes through the use of funds that carry a lower interest rate 
in conjunction with this early debt prepayment  an extraordinary loss of million million net of tax was recorded  consisting of prepayment premiums and a write off of previously capitalized deferred debt issuance costs and original issue discount 
restrictive covenants the term loan  the revolver and the new notes contain restrictive covenants  which require us to meet certain financial tests  including minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time  subject to allowances for seasonal fluctuations 
the credit agreements applicable to dmc generally limit through restricted payment covenants the ability of dmc to make cash payments to our parent company  limiting our ability to pay monetary dividends 
in addition  the build to suit lease arrangement for warehouse facilities adjacent to four of our production plants contains restrictive covenants 
the restrictive covenants include financial tests such as fixed charge ratio  senior debt ratio and total debt ratio 
we believe that we were in compliance with all such financial covenants at all testing intervals  and as of june  the most restrictive of these covenants currently is the senior debt ratio related to the build to suit lease arrangement 
pension funding as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june   our defined benefit retirement plans were previously determined to be underfunded under erisa guidelines 
it has been our policy to fund our retirement plans in an amount consistent with the funding requirements of federal law and regulations and not to exceed an amount that would be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
in connection with the recapitalization in april  we entered into an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation  dated april   under which we agreed to contribute a total of million to our defined benefit pension plans through calendar as a result of the downturn of the financial markets  the investment returns from our pension plan assets declined million and million for the years ended of june  and  respectively 
this has caused our pension plans to become underfunded by million as of june  from an overfunded status of million as of june  we have recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of million million net of tax as part of other comprehensive loss in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity as of june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  insurance we maintain insurance coverage to manage our risks related to workers compensation  property  automobile liability  general liability  directors and officers and other potential exposures

this policy expired at the end of fiscal beginning in fiscal  we retain all liabilities up to million increased to million effective july  per claim for workers compensation 
the insurance industry has become more selective in offering certain types of insurance coverage  such as property  product liability  product recall and directors and officers liability 
we were able to obtain these insurance coverages for fiscal our fiscal insurance program is consistent with both our past level of coverage and our risk management policies 
fiscal insurance expense is estimated at million  which includes estimated accruals of amounts for our loss sensitive insurance policies 
environmental matters we spent approximately million on domestic environmental expenditures from fiscal through fiscal  primarily related to wastewater treatment systems  settlement of environmental litigation and ust remediation activities 
we project that we will spend an aggregate of approximately million in fiscal and on capital projects and other expenditures in connection

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s financial instruments and risk management policies our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
the average debt balance for our domestic short term borrowings and long term debt was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate for these obligations was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
our interest expense with regard to our revolving and term loan agreement is calculated using a reference interest rate plus a credit margin 
therefore  given a fixed debt level and a fixed credit margin  interest expense increases or decreases in relation to market interest rates 
a basis point change in the reference rate on our variable bank debt rate  after giving effect to the swap agreements noted below  would result in an approximate change of million and million in interest expense for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this assumes consistent debt levels for fiscal and historically  to reduce our exposure to higher interest rates  we have entered into interest rate protection agreements to limit the impact of rate increases on future income 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with the underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on interest rate fluctuations alone  nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we believe that our use of interest rate protection agreements to manage risk is in del monte s best interest and that any resulting market risk exposure would not materially effect operating results 
market risk exposure has been defined as the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
the terms of our revolving and term loan agreement required us to enter into and maintain one or more permitted swap obligations as defined in the loan agreement for  among other things  a notional amount of at least million and for a term of at least three years 
to accomplish this  and to limit our exposure to interest rate increases  we entered into interest rate swaps on august  the aggregate notional amount of the swaps is million and the swaps are in effect from september  through september  the swaps are with several banks and fix the three month libor at a weighted average rate of per annum on the million notional amount 
this fixed interest rate is measured against three month libor for purposes of settlement 
the fair value of each swap is determined independently by each bank  using its own valuation model  based on the projected three month libor yield curve 
according to each bank  valuations based on other models may yield different results 
the swaps were not initially designated as hedging instruments under sfas as amended by sfas and when they were entered into on august  changes in fair value of the swaps from that date to their designation date as hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended june  the fair value of the swaps at january  was a liability of million 
this liability will be credited to interest expense in the consolidated statements of income over the remaining life of the swap agreements 
this credit offsets interest expense in connection with the swap agreements 
on january   we designated the swaps as cash flow hedging instruments of market interest rate risk under sfas the changes in the fair value of the swaps subsequent to the january  designation date are recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity in an amount equal to the effective portion deemed in accordance with sfas of the hedging instruments 
the remaining amount  if any  equal to the ineffective portion deemed in accordance with sfas of the hedging instruments is recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of the swaps at january  and june  was a liability of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended june   the change in fair value of the swaps through january  resulted in a loss on financial instruments of million 
for the year ended june   the change in fair value of the swaps from january  to june  resulted in other comprehensive loss of million million net of tax 
interest expense for the year ended june  was increased by million due to the impact of the swaps 
interest expense for the year ended june  includes a credit to interest expense of million  reflecting a release to earnings from the million liability  attributed to the january  to june  period 
a total of million of additional credits to interest expense are expected for fiscal settlements accrued for payment to the swap counterparties offset these releases to earnings from this liability 
we had two interest rate cap agreements during fiscal  for the term and revolver loans  both of which had terms of twelve months which ended june  the incremental effect of these interest rate contracts on interest expense for the year ended june  was million 
we do not believe we have any material commodity risk because we purchase most of our raw product requirements through arrangements under which pricing has not fluctuated significantly in recent years 
see business supply and note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  
table of contents factors that may affect future results our future operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors  including  among others  those factors discussed below 
further  the future operating results of del monte following the completion of the proposed merger of dmc with and into skf foods may be materially affected by a number of additional factors that are discussed in the proxy statement prospectus included as part of the registration statement we have filed with the sec concerning the merger 
we urge you to read the risk factors section of that proxy statement prospectus for a description of the factors that could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operation following the merger 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements  including those in the sections captioned business  selected financial data  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and financial statements and supplementary data 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs or expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on plans  estimates and projections at the time we make the statements  and readers should not place undue reliance on them 
we do not undertake to update any of these statements in light of new information or future events 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
we caution you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
these factors include  among others general economic and business conditions  weather conditions  crop yields  competition  including pricing and promotional spending levels by competitors  ability to increase prices  raw material costs and availability  the loss of significant customers  market acceptance of new products  successful integration of acquired businesses  consolidation of processing plants  changes in business strategy or development plans  availability  terms and deployment of capital  changes in  or the failure or inability to comply with  governmental regulations  including  without limitation  environmental regulations  industry trends and capacity and other factors discussed below 
factors relating to future benefits of the proposed merger of dmc with and into skf foods inc that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in this annual report include those factors previously mentioned  as well as the inability to obtain stockholder or regulatory approvals  including without limitations a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  actions of the us  foreign and local governments  the inability to successfully integrate del monte and the heinz businesses  costs related to the merger  the inability to achieve synergies resulting from the merger  and other factors 
failure to complete the proposed merger of dmc and the heinz businesses could adversely impact the market price of del monte common stock as well as our business and operating results 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the spin off and the merger will be completed and the related benefits will be realized 
we may also be subject to additional risks if the merger is not completed  including depending on the reasons for termination of the merger agreement  the requirement that we pay heinz a termination fee of million  substantial costs related to the merger  such as legal  accounting  filing  financial advisory and financial printing fees  must be paid regardless of whether the merger is completed  and potential disruption to our businesses and distraction of our workforce and management team 
our high leverage could adversely affect our business 
we are highly leveraged 
we can incur additional indebtedness  even though our amended and restated credit facility imposes some limits on our ability to do so 
because our business is seasonal  our borrowings fluctuate significantly during the year  generally peaking in september and october 
our high degree of leverage can have important adverse consequences  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business  
table of contents limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged  increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions  and increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates 
our ability to pay our debt service depends partly on our performance 
our financial position could also prevent us from obtaining necessary financing at favorable rates  including at times when we must refinance maturing debt 
if we cannot pay our debt service and meet our other liquidity needs from operating cash flow  we could have substantial liquidity problems 
if we default on any of our debt  the relevant lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt and take other actions that could adversely affect us 
for example  in the event of a default under our bank financing  the lenders could foreclose on the security for the facility  which includes virtually all of the assets of our company 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  including the notes and the amended and restated credit facility  and to fund planned capital expenditures and possible expansions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes and our credit facility  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the notes and our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our significant indebtedness  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt through additional borrowings 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above 
the indenture under which the senior subordinated notes were issued permits us to borrow up to an additional million under its amended and restated credit facility from an initial capacity of million from additional commitments from new or existing lenders without any additional approval from the existing lenders 
all of the borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility will be senior to the notes issued under the indenture 
in addition to substantial amounts of money from other sources and amounts that may be borrowed under the amended and restated credit facility  the indenture also allows us to borrow money 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
our business is highly competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share 
many companies compete in the domestic processed vegetable  fruit and tomato product categories 
however  only a few well established companies operate on both a national and a regional basis with one or several branded product lines 
we face strong competition from these and other companies in all our product lines 
important competitive considerations include the following some of our competitors have greater financial resources and operating flexibility than us 
this may permit them to respond better to changes in the industry or to introduce new products and packaging more quickly and with greater marketing support 
several of our product lines are sensitive to competition from regional brands  and many of our product lines compete with imports  private label products and fresh alternatives 
no single private label competitor has greater market share than us in our principal product categories 
in fiscal  private label products as a group had market shares of  and in the processed vegetable  major fruit and solid tomato categories  respectively 
we cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us and  when we raise our prices  we may lose market share to our competitors 

table of contents the processed food industry has in the past experienced processing over capacity  which could create an imbalance in supply and demand that depresses sales volumes or prices 
sales of our products depend upon a limited number of customers 
a relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our total sales 
during the year ended june   our top customers represented approximately of our sales  with sales to wal mart stores  inc representing approximately of sales 
in recent years  there has been significant consolidation among our customers through acquisitions 
our business may be seriously harmed if we experience a loss of any of our significant customers or suffer a substantial reduction in orders from these customers 
our business strategies pose risks associated with our ability to reach targeted customers and complete acquisitions successfully 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to reduce costs 
we plan to use improved processing technologies to maintain our position as a low cost and efficient producer 
the success of our business strategy also depends on our ability to increase sales of our products such as single serve fruit products  diced tomatoes  specialty vegetables and orchard select jarred fruit  and to increase product distribution through high volume club stores  such as sam s and costco  supercenters and mass merchandisers  such as wal mart supercenters 
we also plan to grow through acquisitions 
all of these plans involve risks  including the following we may not complete capital projects on time or within budget 
acquisitions may not be accretive and may negatively impact operating results 
our customers generally do not enter into long term contracts and generally purchase products based on their inventory levels 
they can stop purchasing our products at any time 
losing any significant customer would affect sales volumes and could also have a negative effect on our reputation 
acquisitions could require the consent of our bank lenders and could involve amendments to our principal credit facility to permit us to comply with our financial covenants 
these lenders could also impose conditions on their consent that could adversely affect our operating flexibility 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses  including personnel  operating facilities and information systems  into our existing operations 
the timing and number of acquisitions could make these risks more difficult to address 
the process of integrating acquired businesses could distract management from other opportunities or problems in our business 
the benefits of an acquisition often take time to develop  and there is no guarantee that any acquisition will in fact produce any benefits 
in pursuing acquisitions  we could incur substantial additional debt and contingent liabilities  which could in turn restrict our ability to pursue other important elements of our business strategy or our ability to comply with our financial covenants 
the capability improvement program begun in june may not perform as expected  resulting in business disruptions 
in june  we began implementing a capability improvement program to upgrade business processes and information systems 
the program will be implemented in phases and is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year significant disruptions to our business may result if the program does not work as expected  if implementation is delayed or if our personnel are unable to effectively adapt to new programs and processes 
our operating results are negatively impacted by the current trend of our customers reducing their levels of inventory 
our trade customers have been reducing their inventory levels significantly during the past several fiscal years 
as a result  our sales to trade customers are less than the volume of purchases of our products by consumers 
the effect of this trend was significant in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as trade customers reduced the inventory levels they had built in preparation for possible year shortages 
the inventory reduction continued at a modest rate into fiscal and continued to a lesser extent throughout this year 
the reduction of retailer inventory decreased our shipments and adversely affected our growth  gross margin and working capital requirements 
if the trend of reducing trade inventory levels continues  it could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents severe weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop supplies and reduce our operating results 
severe weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  earthquakes or pestilence  may affect the supply of our products 
irregular weather patterns may persist over a long period and further impact the supply of our products 
these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  lower recoveries of usable raw materials  higher costs of cold storage if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable or interruptions in our production schedules if harvests are delayed 
competing manufacturers can be affected differently depending on the location of their supplies 
if our supplies of raw materials are reduced  we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our operating results are highly seasonal 
interference with our production schedule during peak months could negatively impact our operating results 
we do not manufacture the majority of our products continuously throughout the year  but instead have a seasonal production period that is limited to approximately three to four months primarily during the summer each year 
our working capital requirements are also seasonal and are most significant in the first and second fiscal quarters 
an unexpected plant shutdown or any other material interference with our production schedule could adversely affect our operating results 
our sales tend to peak in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  mainly as a result of the holiday period in november and december and the easter holiday 
by contrast  in the first fiscal quarter of each year  sales generally decline  mainly due to less promotional activity and the availability of fresh produce 
we believe that the main trends in our operating results are relatively predictable and that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund operations during periods of low sales 
if these trends were to change or be disrupted  however  our operating results could be adversely affected  and we could require additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital and other cash requirements 
our business is subject to the risk of environmental liability  and we could be named as a responsible party 
as a result of our agricultural and food processing activities  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
we have been named as a prp and may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain designated superfund sites under cercla  or under similar state laws 
we are defending ourselves in these actions as appropriate 
however  we cannot assure you that none of these matters will adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
we may in the future be named as a prp at other currently or previously owned or operated sites  and additional remediation requirements could be imposed on us 
other properties could be identified for investigation or proposed for listing under cercla or similar state laws 
also  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the food quality protection act of  the us environmental protection agency is involved in a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry 
the effect of such actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
texas pacific group continues to control our company  which could lead to a conflict of interest 
texas pacific group currently owns of the outstanding common stock of del monte 
texas pacific group will likely continue to use its significant ownership interest to influence our management and policies 
we also have contractual relationships with texas pacific group  under which texas pacific group provides us with financial advisory and other services 
these arrangements could give rise to conflicts of interest 
our debt covenants can restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these restrictions depends on many factors beyond our control 
we are subject to various financial and operating covenants under our amended and restated credit facility and the indenture  including limitations on asset sales  the amount of debt we can incur or repay and the amount and kind of distributions that we may make 
we must also meet specified financial ratios and tests  including minimum interest coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our bank debt 

table of contents our del monte brand name could be confused with names of other companies who  by their act or omission  could adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name 
we have licensed the del monte brand name to various unaffiliated companies internationally and  for some products  in the united states 
the common stock of one licensee  fresh del monte produce inc  is publicly traded in the united states 
acts or omissions by these unaffiliated companies may adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name  the trading prices for del monte common stock and demand for our products 
third party announcements or rumors about these licensees could also have these negative effects 
our reliance on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations and california s recent energy situation could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california recently experienced an energy situation that could have disrupted our fruit and tomato processing operations and increased our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance may not provide coverage for damages that we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in the power supply to us 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could result in significant increases in production costs and lost revenue  which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
del monte s energy costs have substantially increased since fiscal this increase and any future increase may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we appointed a single national broker to represent us to the retail grocery trade 
in june  we appointed advantage sales and marketing advantage as our single national broker to represent our products to the retail grocery trade 
prior to the appointment of advantage  we relied on multiple regional brokers to represent our products 
we believe that a single broker will be able to more effectively represent our products to the increasingly consolidated retail grocery trade 
however  our business would suffer substantial disruption if advantage were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services 
our business would be adversely affected if advantage fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade 
our data network services are managed by eds using the worldcom  inc network 
we obtain our data network services through eds  which has sub contracted the network services to worldcom 
worldcom filed for bankruptcy under chapter in july our business would be adversely affected if worldcom fails to provide reliable services 
our reliance upon co packers to provide supply of certain products 
we have a number of supply agreements with co packers that require them to provide us with certain finished products 
the failure of any such co packer to fulfill their obligations under the applicable agreements could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods 
our ability to competitively serve our customers is a function of reliable and low cost transportation 
disruption of the supply of these services and or significant increases in the cost of these services could impact our operating results 
we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market 
they include ocean  truck  tofc or intermodal  and railcar 
disruption to the timely supply of these services or dramatic increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability of fuel for such services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers  and consumers and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance
