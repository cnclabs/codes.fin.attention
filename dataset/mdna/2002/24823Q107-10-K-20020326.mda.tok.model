item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dendreon corporation is dedicated to the discovery and development of novel products for the treatment of diseases through its innovative manipulation of the immune system 
dendreon s product pipeline is focused on cancer  and includes therapeutic vaccines  monoclonal antibodies and a pathway to small molecules 
the products most advanced in development are therapeutic vaccines that stimulate a patient s immunity for the treatment of cancer 
provenge is a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer and is in phase iii clinical trials  the final stage of product development 
we are conducting phase ii clinical trials for mylovenge  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of multiple myeloma  and phase i clinical trials for apc  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
we have received clearance from the food and drug administration to begin a phase i clinical trial for ctl  our collaborative project with j j prd  for the treatment of breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
we have additional therapeutic vaccines  monoclonal antibodies and a pathway to small molecule drug discovery in preclinical development for the treatment of cancer 
we also intend  over time  to pursue the application of our technologies in the fields of autoimmune diseases  allergies and infectious diseases 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations  clinical trial expenses and marketing expenses 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we complete our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technology  expand our operations and develop the systems that support commercialization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  financing operations  long term service contracts  and other contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
revenue recognition revenue has been derived from our collaborative research and development agreements and from grant awards 
we expect to continue to derive revenue from our collaborative research and development agreements in future years 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators is recognized when research services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as agreed or specified in each agreement 
the payments received under research collaboration agreements are not refundable if the research effort is not successful 
payments received in advance of the services provided are deferred and recognized as revenue over the future performance periods 
revenue related to grant agreements is recognized as related research and development expenses are incurred 
milestone payments are recognized based upon the achievement of the specified milestone and as defined in the agreements 
revenue from product supply agreements is recorded when the product is shipped and when all obligations under the agreements are met 
as of december   we had deferred revenues of approximately million 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in and in collaborative and license revenue represented million  million and million of total revenue in  and  respectively 
grant revenue was  in   in and  in  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily due to agreements entered into with j j prd and kirin 
in  we expect comparable collaborative and license revenue and no grant funding 
in august  we entered into a memorandum agreement with kirin modifying our existing agreements with them 
pursuant to the terms contained in the memorandum  kirin paid us million  agreed to make an additional milestone payment upon commencement of kirin s first clinical trial of mylovenge  and to compensate us for supplies of provenge and separation devices  and to reimburse us for certain expenses relating to specified services provided for kirin s regulatory  clinical  and manufacturing activities relating to provenge and mylovenge 
the payment received in is being amortized over months  the term of the agreement 
under the terms of our initial agreement with kirin  we are reimbursed by kirin for research and development expenses pursuant to a mutually agreed development plan 
kirin will also make certain milestone payments upon achieving specified objectives 
in  kirin reimbursed us million for such research and development expenses 
in  we anticipate reimbursement from kirin will be comparable to levels 
in october  we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement with j j prd for the study of the parties respective products for the treatment of tumors expressing her neu 
the agreement reimburses us for research and development expenses based on a mutually agreed research plan 
in  we were reimbursed million by j j prd for these expenses and anticipate that amount to decrease by in the agreement with j j prd terminates on december  we are currently in discussions with j j prd about continuing our collaboration 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the million increase in over  and the million increase in over were due to increased product development expenses  including fees paid to third parties conducting clinical trials  increased personnel related expenses  facilities and depreciation expenses and supplies 
the increase over also included million in non cash stock based compensation expense 
our research and development related activities can be divided into two areas research and pre clinical programs  and clinical programs 
we estimate the cost of the two areas as follows in millions research and pre clinical programs clinical programs total research and development we anticipate an increase in total research and development expense in over clinical costs may grow at a faster rate compared to research and pre clinical expenses as products move to the next stage of development 
final data results from our first phase iii provenge trial may influence the allocation of resources between the research  pre clinical and clinical programs 
research and development costs by project are not tracked on an actual cost basis  but rather are derived by the allocation of third party costs  personnel related costs and other overheads to a project based on human resource time incurred in each project 
research and pre clinical projects primarily represent the costs associated with our product pipeline generating activities  including trp p  dn  dn  and apcny 
the cost of clinical trial programs represents the advancement of the pipeline into product candidates 
it is not possible to estimate the time to completion of the clinical trials and their associated total costs as this is dependent on the outcome of each trial event 
in september  dendreon licensed rights to the cea and mn antigens from bayer corporation in two separate agreements 
we paid a license fee upon execution of each agreement  and will make milestone payments of  on each of the products on the earlier of either the start of animal safety testing or april  additional milestone payments will be due at the start of phase iii clinical trials of products incorporating cea or mn and the first fda approval of such products  if successful 
royalties on sales of any products incorporating cea or mn will be due to bayer if and when commercial sales of such products commence 
in october  dendreon licensed rights to htert from geron 
we paid a license fee at inception of  shares of our common stock valued at  and shall pay geron a second license fee of  on the first anniversary of the agreement 
in addition  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to geron 
the first milestone payment is due upon the submission of the first ind for a product incorporating htert and the second is due upon submission of the first biologics license application to the fda 
three subsequent milestone payments are due upon submission of the second bla or equivalent  and upon the first and second product approvals  if any 
the agreement may be terminated by us without cause on sixty days written notice to geron 
in march  we contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the scale up to commercial level production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
at the inception of the agreement  we anticipated that a substantial part of the work and corresponding expense would be incurred in pursuant to procedures established in the agreement  we requested certain modifications to the program for scale up to commercial level production 
the modification would require six to eight weeks for the review of data and an additional period for establishment of regulatory strategy prior to proceeding with certain scheduled program requirements 
diosynth has wound down certain of the program work and has proposed a change order in response to our modification request 
dendreon intends to negotiate with diosynth regarding the terms of its proposed change order 
we may terminate the agreement with diosynth without cause on forty five days written notice to diosynth 
the agreement provides for a cancellation fee of of the unpaid balance of the total estimated budget for the program at the time the notice is given 
the estimated cancellation fee in support of the current work plan is million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase over was due to personnel related expenses and consulting fees associated with commercialization activities 
the increase over was attributable to personnel related expenses and non cash stock based compensation  offset by a decrease in facilities and depreciation expense 
we currently anticipate general and administrative spending to increase slightly over levels 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million in from  in and in these increases were due to consulting expenses primarily in connection with commercialization efforts  personnel related costs  marketing of our clinical trials for provenge  and medical education of physicians and clinicians with regard to our clinical products under development 
marketing expenses are expected to be at levels comparable to interest income 
interest income increased to million in from million in and  in these increases were attributable to higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  offset by a lower average interest rate yield on the investment portfolio 
interest income is expected to be lower in than due to the decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in and increased from  in the decrease over was attributable to lower average balances of debt and capital lease obligation while the increase from was the result of the loan obtained in june income tax expense 
due to operating losses there was no provision for income taxes in income tax expense in was  and related to a withholding tax assessed by japan on certain payments received from kirin 
there was no provision for income taxes in at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset any future federal taxable income 
if not utilized  the tax net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in the ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date 
we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of in  million in  and million in we initially recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing them by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million in  million in  and  in we expect amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense to be  in   in and  in deemed dividend upon issuance of convertible preferred stock we recorded a deemed dividend of million and  in and  respectively  for the issuance of series e convertible preferred stock 
the incremental fair value determined on the date of issuance for each closing of series e convertible preferred stock is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to additional paid in capital  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the amount increased the loss attributable to common stockholders in the calculation of net loss per share for and liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments were million at december  we have financed our operations to date through our initial public offering  follow on public offering  the private placement of equity securities  revenue from collaborative arrangements  grant revenue  interest income earned on cash  cash equiv alents and investments  equipment lease line financings and loan facilities 
from january  to december   we received net proceeds of million from private financing activities and million from our public offerings of our common stock 
in  we received net proceeds of million from private financing activities 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of increased research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
in and  these expenditures were offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators including research and development expense reimbursements from kirin and j j prd and from non refundable  upfront payments received from the memorandum entered into with kirin in investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
we have an agreement with a financing company under which we have financed purchases of million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment 
the terms are from to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year 
we also had a tenant improvement allowance of million from the lessor of our primary seattle  washington facility 
as of december   we had committed all of the allowance for laboratory and manufacturing space at this facility 
the improvement allowance bears interest at the rate of per year and is repaid monthly over the length of the original lease 
in  we will continue to fund our capital equipment and leasehold improvements through financing facilities 
in june  we obtained a loan in the amount of million from a financial lender 
the loan bore interest at an annual rate of  and was re paid march  the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations  including interest in thousands contractual commitments total year years years thereafter long term obligations capital lease obligations    operating leases      total contractual commitments      as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing prior to that time 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials 
factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have a history of operating losses  we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never be profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
operating losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our general and administrative costs 
we have earned no significant revenues from product sales or royalties 
we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for several years  and are not able to predict when we might do so  if ever 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future 
these losses may increase significantly in response to the expansion of our preclinical development pipeline  the commencement of preclinical development and the associated clinical trial efforts  and the continued development of the systems that support commercialization  if it is pursued 
our ability to achieve long term profitability is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully commercializing our products alone or with third parties 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our products  and our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
we may take longer to complete our clinical trials than we project  or we may not be able to complete them at all 
although for planning purposes we project the commencement  continuation and completion of our clinical trials  a number of factors  including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  and difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  may cause significant delays 
we may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our products as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
we rely on academic institutions or clinical research organizations to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products 
we have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
third party clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedules or consistent with a clinical trial protocol  and may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely manner 
if we fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our planned clinical trials  our stock price and our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could be harmed 
in addition  our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products and product candidates will be adversely affected 
if testing of a particular product does not yield successful results  then we will be unable to commercialize that product 
we must demonstrate our products safety and efficacy in humans through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our products  including the following 
safety and efficacy results obtained in early human clinical trials  as in our prostate cancer and multiple myeloma trials  may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  
the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  
after reviewing test results  we or our collaborators may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising  including provenge  
we  our collaborators or regulators  may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  and 
the effects of our potential products may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved 
clinical testing is very expensive  takes many years  and the outcome is uncertain 
the interim results from the first of our two phase iii clinical trials of provenge in hrcp patients were inconclusive  and indicated that it is possible  but not probable  that the primary endpoint of the trial will be achieved 
additional data is required for a final analysis  and the final analysis is expected to be completed in mid the final data from this clinical trial and or the second phase iii trial may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of provenge 
data from our other clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of our other potential products 
the clinical trials of provenge  mylvenge  and our other products under development may not be completed on schedule and the fda may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale 
if we fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a cancer vaccine under development  this would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the vaccine  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
if our products are not accepted by the market  we will not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the success of any product we may develop will depend upon the medical community  patients and third party payors accepting our products as medically useful  cost effective  and safe 
we cannot guarantee that any of our products in development  if approved for commercialization  will be used by doctors to treat patients 
the degree of market acceptance for our products depends upon a number of factors  including 
the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals  
demonstrating the efficacy and safety of our products to the medical and patient community  
the cost and advantages of our products compared to other available therapies  and 
reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
we may require additional funding  and our future access to capital is uncertain 
it is expensive to develop cancer vaccines  conduct clinical trials for vaccines  and commercialize products 
we plan to continue to simultaneously conduct clinical trials and preclinical research for many different cancer and autoimmune disease vaccines  as well as products based on our monoclonal antibody technology 
we also may be investing resources in the development of a commercial infrastructure 
each of these activities is costly 
our future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  development of a commercial infrastructure  and the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical research 
we may need to raise additional capital to 
fund operations  
continue the research and development of our therapeutic vaccines and other products  and 
commercialize our vaccines 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing within this time frame depending on a number of factors  including the following 
our degree of success in developing and commercializing cancer vaccine products  
the amount of milestone payments we receive from our collaborators  
the rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  
the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  
changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  and 
the cost of manufacturing scale up and development of commercial infrastructure and of marketing activities  to the extent that we undertake them 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials and other activities 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders will result 
we are subject to extensive regulation  which is costly  time consuming and may subject us to unanticipated delays  even if we obtain regulatory approval for some of our products  those products may still face regulatory difficulties 
all of our potential products  cell processing and manufacturing activities  are subject to comprehensive regulation by the food and drug administration  or fda  in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  is expensive and often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
provenge  mylovenge and our other products are novel  therefore  regulatory agencies lack experience with them  which may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of provenge  mylovenge and our other products 
no cancer vaccine using dendritic cell technologies has been approved for marketing 
consequently  there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies 
in addition  we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals  which may impede our ability to obtain timely fda approvals 
we have not yet sought fda approval for any vaccine product 
we will not be able to commercialize any of our potential products until we obtain fda approval 
therefore  any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  fda approval would harm our business 
if we violate regulatory requirements at any stage  whether before or after marketing approval is obtained  we may be fined  forced to remove a product from the market and experience other adverse consequences  including delay  which could materially harm our financial results 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products 
we may also be required to undertake post marketing trials 
in addition  if we or others identify side effects after any of our vaccines are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our vaccines  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our vaccines  and additional marketing applications may be required 
an investigational new drug application must become effective before human clinical trials may commence 
the investigational new drug application is automatically effective days after receipt by the fda  unless before that time the fda requests an extension to review the application  or raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the application 
in the latter case  the sponsor of the application and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed 
thus  the submission of an investigational new drug application may not result in the fda authorizing us to commence clinical trials in any given case 
preclinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda regulates preclinical studies under a series of regulations called the current good laboratory practices regulations 
if the sponsor violates these regulations  the fda  in some cases  may invalidate the studies and require that the sponsor replicate those studies 
the availability and amount of reimbursement for our potential products  and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for our potential products is uncertain  we may face challenges from government and private payors that adversely affect reimbursement for our potential products 
we expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with our products  if approved for marketing  will be eligible for medicare benefits 
other patients may be covered by private health plans or uninsured 
the application of existing medicare regulations and interpretive rulings to newly approved products  especially novel products such as ours  is not certain and those regulations and interpretive rulings are subject to change 
if we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from medicare or from private health plans  our ability to sell our potential products will be adversely affected 
medicare regulations and interpretive rulings also may determine who provides certain services 
this may adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products  if approved 
federal and state governments  as well as foreign governments  continue to propose legislation designed to contain or reduce health care costs 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of biologics may change or be adopted before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our products under development unaffordable 
in addition  government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost effectiveness of biologics and pharmaceuticals 
therefore  any one or all of our products under development may ultimately not be considered cost effective by these third party payors and thus not be covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price 
any of these initiatives or developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our potential products 
we rely on third parties to perform a variety of functions and have limited manufacturing and cell processing capabilities  which could limit our ability to commercialize our products 
we rely in part on collaborators and other third parties to perform for us or assist us with a variety of important functions  including research and development  manufacturing and clinical trials management 
we also license technology from others to enhance or supplement our technologies 
we have never manufactured our cancer vaccines and other products on a commercial scale 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 
we have contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the scale up to commercial level production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
we cannot be certain that this contract will result in our ability to produce the antigen for provenge on a commercial scale  if provenge is successful 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce large quantities of materials needed for clinical trials and product commercialization 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our clinical testing may be delayed  thereby delaying the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of our products 
any delay may lower our revenues and potential profitability and adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  we and any third party manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if our facilities or the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of our vaccines will not be granted 
in complying with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements  we and any of our third party manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that our products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we or any of our third party manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements  we may be subject to regulatory action 
we have constructed two facilities for cell processing  the manufacture of antigens for our clinical trials  and final formulation of our cancer vaccines 
we also use three third party cell processing centers 
these five facilities may not be sufficient to meet our needs for our prostate  multiple myeloma and other clinical trials 
additionally  if we decide to manufacture our products in commercial quantities ourselves  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees  construct additional facilities and comply with applicable regulations for these facilities  which are extensive 
we may not be able to develop production facilities that both meet regulatory requirements and are sufficient for all clinical trials or commercial use 
if we lose or are unable to secure collaborators  or if our collaborators  including kirin  do not apply adequate resources to their collaboration with us  our product development and potential for profitability may suffer 
we intend to enter into collaborations for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to some of our products under development 
we have entered into a collaboration with kirin relating to the development and commercialization of our products based on our dendritic cell technologies in asia 
as our collaborator  kirin funds testing  makes regulatory filings and may manufacture and market our products in asia 
the amount and timing of resources applied by kirin or other potential collaborators to our joint efforts are not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our products under development could be slowed down or blocked completely 
it is possible that kirin or other collaborators will change their strategic focus  pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs 
the effectiveness of our collaborators in marketing our products will also affect our revenues and earnings 
our collaboration with kirin may not continue or be successful and we may not receive any further research funding  milestone or royalty payments 
we recognized approximately of our revenue in from our collabo ration with kirin 
we intend to continue to enter into new collaborative agreements in the future 
however  we may not be able to successfully negotiate any additional collaborative arrangements 
if established  these relationships may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
any additional collaborations would likely subject us to some or all of the risks described above with respect to our collaboration with kirin 
disputes may arise between us and our existing or potential collaborators  as to a variety of matters  including financial or other obligations under our agreements 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we are dependent on single source vendors for some of our components 
we currently depend on single source vendors for some of the components necessary for our vaccine candidates such as cell culture media 
there are  in general  relatively few alternative sources of supply for these products 
while these vendors have produced our products with acceptable quality  quantity and cost in the past  they may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these products could take a substantial amount of time 
if we have to switch to a replacement vendor  the manufacture and delivery of our vaccines could be interrupted for an extended period 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably 
our success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry may not be as strong as in other more well established fields 
accordingly  the united states patent and trademark office may not issue patents from the patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
if issued  the patents may not give us an advantage over competitors with similar technology 
it is also possible that third parties may successfully avoid our patents through design innovation 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability and it is uncertain how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings  such as oppositions  which may be brought in domestic or foreign jurisdictions to challenge the validity of a patent 
a third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the patent office 
it is possible that a third party may successfully challenge our patents or patents licensed by us from others  or that a challenge will result in limiting their coverage 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents and to prevent infringement can be substantial and  if the outcome of litigation is adverse to us  third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us 
moreover  it is possible that third parties may infringe our patents 
to stop these activities we may need to file a lawsuit 
even if we were successful in stopping the violation of our patent rights  these lawsuits are expensive and consume time and other resources 
in addition  there is a risk that a court would decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention 
there is also the risk that  even if the validity of our patents is upheld  a court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that its activities are not covered by  that is  do not infringe  our patents 
in addition to the intellectual property rights described above  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
therefore  others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection for our information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  they may not provide adequate remedies 
the use of our technologies could potentially conflict with the rights of others 
our competitors or others may have or acquire patent rights that they could enforce against us 
if they do so  then we may be required to alter our products  pay licensing fees or cease activities 
if our products conflict with patent rights of others  third parties could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
we may not prevail in any legal action and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources 
if there is litigation against us  we may not be able to continue our operations as planned 
should third parties file patent applications  or be issued patents claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications  we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention 
we may be required to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications 
we may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties as a result of an unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding 
a prevailing party in that case may not offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
we are exposed to potential product liability claims  and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
we have clinical trial coverage and we intend to obtain product liability coverage in the future 
however  insurance coverage may not be available to us at an acceptable cost  if at all 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers and loss of revenues 
thus  whether or not we are insured  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
competition in the cancer vaccine  infectious disease  autoimmune disease and allergy fields is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue 
there are products currently under development by others that could compete with the products that we are developing 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
our competitors may 
develop safer or more effective immunotherapeutics and other therapeutic products  
each the market more rapidly  reducing the potential sales of our products  or 
establish superior proprietary positions 
we understand that companies  including avi biopharma  inc  cell genesys  inc  northwest biotherapeutics  inc  therion biologics corporation and vical incorporated may be developing prostate cancer vaccines that could potentially compete with provenge  if provenge is successfully developed 
these competitors may succeed in developing and marketing cancer vaccines that are more effective than  or marketed before  provenge 
receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our profitability and financial position would suffer 
we anticipate that we will face increased completion in the future as new companies enter our markets and as scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate 
if our products receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our profitability and financial position would suffer 
we must expand our operations to commercialize our products  which we may not be able to do 
we will need to expand and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete future research  development and commercialization efforts 
to grow we will need to add personnel and expand our capabilities  which may strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to complete effectively and manage our growth  we must 
train  manage and motivate a growing employee base  
accurately forecast demand for our products  and 
expand existing operational  financial and management information systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our product development and commercialization efforts could be curtailed or delayed 
if we lose key employees or cannot recruit qualified employees  our product development programs and our research and development efforts may be harmed 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our key employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees may delay our product development programs and our research and development efforts 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
competition for qualified employees among companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry is intense 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we may be required to expand substantially our workforce  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and sales and marketing 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
the trading price for our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  volatile 
the price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors  including our historical and anticipated operating results  preclinical and clinical trial results  market perception of the prospects for biotechnology companies as an industry sector and general market and economic conditions  some of which are beyond our control 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial and operating results  changes in government regulations affecting product approvals reimbursement or other aspects of our or our competitors businesses  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us our competitors  developments concerning key personnel and our intellectual property rights  significant collaborations or strategic alliances and publicity regarding actual or potential performance of products under development by us or our competitors could also cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock 
moreover  during periods of stock market price volatility  share prices of many biotechnology companies have often fluctuated in a manner not necessarily related to the companies operating performance 
accordingly  our common stock may be subject to greater price volatility than the stock market as a whole 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could reduce the voting power of the holders of our common stock and the likelihood that common stockholders will receive payments upon liquidation 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short and long term investments  assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
our outstanding bank loans and capital lease obligations are all at fixed interest rates and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates
