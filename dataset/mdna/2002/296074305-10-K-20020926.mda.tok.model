patents and royalties the pharmaceutical and medical device communities place considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
the company s policy is to protect its technology by aggressively obtaining patent protection for all of its developments and products  both in the united states and in selected countries outside the united states 
it is the company s policy to file for patent protection in those foreign countries in which the company believes such protection is necessary to protect its economic interests

competition there are numerous direct and indirect competitors of the company in the united states and abroad 
these companies include ophthalmic oriented companies that market a broad portfolio of products  including prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals  ophthalmic devices  consumer products such as contact lens cleaning solution and other eye care products  large integrated pharmaceutical companies that market a limited number of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals in addition to many other pharmaceuticals  and smaller specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are engaged in the development and commercialization of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals and products  and possibly drug delivery systems 
several large companies dominate the ophthalmic market  with the balance of the industry being highly fragmented 
the company believes that these large companies capture approximately of the overall ophthalmic market 
the balance of the market is composed of smaller companies ranging from start up entities to established market players 
the ophthalmic market in general is intensely competitive  with each company eager to expand its market share 
as a result of this competition  the company believes that many of the industry s smaller companies will either consolidate or fail 
the company s strategy is to compete primarily on the basis of technological innovation to which it has proprietary rights 
the company believes  therefore  that its success will depend in large part upon protecting its intellectual property through patents and other governmental regulations 
at the same time  the company recognizes that there are other young and innovative companies that may develop competitive technologies 
the vascular access product line is comprised of low price  disposable devices  and currently it has no direct competition 
however  a significantly higher priced non disposable device that also facilitates vascular access is currently marketed 
there are a variety of other devices that directly compete with sonomed s ultrasound products and the camera back marketed by digital

cautionary factors that may affect future results certain statements contained in this annual report on form k and other written and oral statements made from time to time by the company do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
as such  they are considered forward looking statements which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events 
such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  plan  possible  protect  should  will  and similar words or expressions 
the company s forward looking statements include certain information relating to general business strategy  growth strategies  financial results  liquidity  product development  the introduction of new products  the potential markets and uses for the company s products  the company s plans to file applications with the food and drug administration the fda  the development of joint venture opportunities  the effects of competition on the structure of the markets in which the company competes and defending itself in litigation matters 
one must carefully consider forward looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  and may be affected by assumptions that fail to materialize as anticipated 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed  and actual results may vary materially 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all factors affecting the company s forward looking statements  and investors therefore should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
although it is not possible to create a comprehensive list of all factors that may cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements  the most important factors include  without limitation  the following future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global markets and economies 
the company s current term loan with pnc bank  na provides for quarterly principal payments  which increase every six months  including a  final balloon payment  which is due on june  we believe that cash on hand plus cash available from our line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures and research and development until the balloon payment is due 
we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing in order to satisfy the balloon payment  and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available when required on acceptable terms 
concentration of revenues the company realized and of its net revenue during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  from bausch lomb s sale of silicone oil 
while management does not expect this revenue to decline rapidly in the foreseeable future  any such decrease would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
the company is entitled to receive additional consideration  in varying amounts  through fiscal economic and regulatory conditions and the competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes it is difficult to ascertain if the current economic downturn has affected the company s results 
management believes any effect has been limited to our sonomed business unit 
any further decline in our customers markets or further decline in general economic conditions would likely result in reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
should it become necessary due to economic climate  we cannot assure you that the company will be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to maintain profitability and service our current debt 
in addition  there is a risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which we compete 
these measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
the company could be affected by trends toward managed care  health care cost containment  and other changes in government and private sector initiatives  in the united states and other countries in which the company does business  that are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
changes in governmental laws  regulations  and accounting standards and the enforcement thereof and agency or government actions or investigations involving the industry in general or the company in particular may be averse to the company 
the ability of the company to successfully develop and market new products we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards 
without timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to i properly identify customer needs  ii innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  iii successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  iv manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  v differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  vi price our products competitively  and vii anticipate our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations 
dependence on key personnel our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected in the normal course of business  we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including i the retention of key employees  ii the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted 
the outcome of litigation matters and uncertain protection of patented and proprietary information increased public interest in recent years in product liability claims in the medical device industry could affect the company should it become directly involved 
recent events have made the investing public particularly sensitive to listed companies reporting practices and accounting policies in general 
the sec could make regulatory changes that could have a direct effect on the company 
additionally  the company may find it necessary to enforce its legal right with respect to patented and proprietary information 
the outcome of any of these matters and the financial impact they may have on the company cannot be foreseen 
volatility of stock price and the ability of the company to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market the public stock markets have experienced significant volatility in stock prices in recent years  which could cause  the company s stock price to experience severe price changes that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the company 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other factors  quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  announcements of new strategic relationships by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the healthcare industry or the global economy generally  or market volatility unrelated to the company s business and operating results 
the company s common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  certain listing requirements must be met 
if escalon s securities were delisted  investors could find it more difficult to dispose of them  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the company s securities
