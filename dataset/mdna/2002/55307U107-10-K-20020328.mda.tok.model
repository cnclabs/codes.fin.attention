item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
on may   the partnership completed the purchase of the macadamia farming operations from four subsidiaries of c 
brewer and company  ltd 
the acquired assets consisted of acres of macadamia orchards  farming contracts  farming equipment  vehicles  a husking plant  irrigation well  office buildings  garages and warehouses  office furniture and equipment and material inventories related to macadamia farming 
all the assets and operations are located on the island of hawaii 
effective with the acquisition  the partnership began performing all the farming operations for its own  acres and for approximately  additional acres owned by other growers 
results of operations   owned orchard segment production and yields production and yield data for the eight orchards are summarized below expressed in wet in shell pounds at moisture average yield per acre orchard production acquired acreage keaau i june      keaau ii oct

    totals except yields which are averages    production for the orchards purchased in and is net of unusable nuts  as stated in their respective nut purchase agreements 
production for the orchards purchased in and includes all nuts delivered 
the nut purchase contracts for the and orchards require the purchaser  mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa  to purchase all of the nuts delivered from these orchards 
the partnership reports on a calendar year basis  though the natural crop year generally begins in august and runs through april 
production in was higher than  but lower than the record harvest in significant factors affecting the crop were as follows the ka u region was affected by a rainstorm and flood in november of that resulted in a net loss of approximately  wis pounds 
rainfall from the storm replenished the soil moisture and improved the yields in this region for production in the ka u region was hindered by a third consecutive year of drought before the november rainstorm 
rainfall through october was only inches compared to the region s ten year average of inches of rain 
modest improvements in rainfall occurred throughout the record crop in was mainly the result of an exceptionally strong spring crop from the crop year and a heavy fall harvest from the crop in all regions 
the ka u green shoe i orchard and the mauna kea orchard are not yet fully mature 
as a result  the yields from these orchards are expected to be lower on average over the next few years than for the partnership s mature orchards 
at full maturity under favorable growing conditions  a macadamia orchard can produce between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at ka u and between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at keaau 
no trees have reached full maturity in the mauna kea area  but it is expected that production at maturity at the mauna kea orchard will approximate keaau levels 
owned orchard segment nut revenue macadamia nut revenues depend on the number of producing acres  yields per acre and the nut purchase price 
the impact of these factors is summarized in the following table over over trees acres harvested    average yield wis lbs 
acre    nuts harvested s wis lbs 
   nut price wis lbs 
gross nut sales s    litigation adjustment recorded nut sales s    under the nut purchase contracts with mauna loa  the price for nuts delivered is based on the two year trailing average of usda published macadamia nut prices and on a netback component 
the netback component is determined by subtracting from mauna loa s gross revenues from the sale of macadamia products i allocable processing  packaging  marketing  selling and advertising costs and ii a capital charge on the difference between those aggregate gross revenues and aggregate allocable costs 
the following table sets forth the manner in which the nut purchase price per pound was determined for  and lb 
usda price two years prior a usda price one year prior a usda price two year trailing average gross revenues less allocable processing  packaging  marketing  sales and advertising costs less capital charge net back component usda price two year trailing average net back component average of usda two year trailing average price and net back component plus hawaii general excise tax net purchase price b c d a mauna loa s own purchases comprise a substantial portion of nut purchases reported to the usda 
therefore  the usda price component of the purchase price is  to a substantial degree  the average price that mauna loa has paid to purchase macadamia nuts from the partnership and from third parties during the previous two years 
b the nut purchase price for the and orchards was the same for and all previous years 
with the change of ownership of mauna loa in  a quality conversion factor in the nut purchase contracts was initiated 
the effect was to cause a slightly different price of for the orchards in and in c the nut purchase contract covering nut production from the acre keaau lot orchard acquired in september defines the two year trailing average provision slightly differently from the and nut purchase contracts  and thus  results in a different nut price 
the nut price for this orchard was in  in  and in this orchard accounts for less than of the partnership s macadamia nut production 
d the nut purchase contract for the ka u o orchards purchased in may uses only the two year trailing usda average to determine its nut price  which was in and in the average nut price from all orchards declined from the average nut price from all orchards declined from the usda portion fell in and in  representing a general decline in worldwide macadamia prices caused by increased production  primarily in australia 
the netback component fell in compared to and in compared to mauna loa sold an unusually large amount of its nuts as lower valued ingredient nuts in  which reduced their average revenue per pound in the usda published price for the crop year was per pound wis at moisture  which is lower than the price of and lower than the price of 
the usda two year trailing average  which affects the partnership s nut price  will be  a decrease over the two year average 
owned orchard segment cost of goods sold agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as on the quantity of nuts actually harvested 
the partnership s unit costs expressed in dollars per wet in shell pound at moisture are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent  property tax  tree insurance and depreciation by the number of pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard and are summarized below lb

all orchards 

as a result of the farming operations acquisition  the partnership now farms its own orchards  and some costs previously charged as farming expenses by kaci and mkaci were eliminated 
these are the hawaii general excise tax  capital recovery costs and the farming fee 
the partnership saved approximately  in hawaii general excise taxes for and  for the last eight months of hawaii general excise taxes were  in the capital recovery savings in were  and in were  capital recovery costs were  in the elimination of the farming fee in saved the partnership  in and  in the farming fee was  in the general and administrative expense in was  in addition  the general and administrative expenses incurred in the farming operation  which were previously billed and expensed as farming costs  have been classified for the may to december period as general and administration expenses 
this amounted to  in cost of goods sold was  higher in than in and million less in than in  but the cost per pound was less in than and higher in than the higher production costs in were the result of a larger harvest 
lower production costs in were due to the savings mentioned above and to a much smaller harvest in farming segment farming service revenue in connection with the acquisition  the partnership acquired approximately farming contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers 
these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same three locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards 
the farming contracts provide the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs cultivation  irrigation and harvesting  collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overheads  and charge a management fee 
the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed 
revenues from farming services were million for and for may to december were million 
the farming services revenue was less than anticipated due to the abandonment of acres by one of the growers and less repairs required 
the total in was less than expected by the partnership due to the november rainstorm and flood  which prohibited harvesting in some of the orchards under contract in the ka u region due to damage and debris in the orchards 
farming segment cost of services sold the cost of services sold relating to the farming contracts was million for and million for the may to december period of these costs were all reimbursed to the partnership 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting and reporting costs  reimbursements to the managing partner for directors fees  office expenses and liability insurance  and the management fee 
in addition  general and administrative costs are also incurred in connection with the farming operations 
previous to the may acquisition  general and administration costs relating to the partnership s orchards were included in the partnership s farming expenses 
total general and administrative costs for were  higher than in all of this increase was due to  in legal costs associated with the dispute related to the nut purchase contract with mauna loa 
in  general and administrative costs were  higher than in all of this increase was due to costs that were previously charged as farming expenses 
with the acquisition  the partnership also assumed providing certain accounting services to subsidiaries of cbcl 
these services generated income of  in the partnership does not expect to provide any accounting services after a management fee based on partnership cash flow is payable annually to the managing partner 
the amount paid was  for   for  and  for interest income and expense the partnership recorded interest expense of  in and  in this was due to the long term loan used to acquire the farming operations  the assumption of several capitalized equipment leases  and interest expense on a new revolving line of credit 
there was no interest expense in or the partnership funds its working capital needs through funds on hand and  when needed  from short term borrowings  generating interest expense in the process 
net interest income or expense  therefore  is partly a function of any balance carried over from the prior year  the amount and timing of cash generated and distributions paid to investors in the current year  as well as the current level of interest rates 
interest was earned in the amount of  in  primarily from the settlement with mauna loa 
during interest income was earned in the amount of  throughout the partnership had cash on hand  earned  in interest income net of line of credit fees  and incurred no interest expense 
other income of  was recorded in due mainly to the settlement agreement with mauna loa 
 was recorded in due to a claim received on a crop insurance policy for the crop 
production in some fields in the ka u region were lower than their ten year average by more than a deductible in due to the drought in that region 
inflation and taxes in general  prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation 
macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia products  which depend on competition and consumer acceptance 
farming costs  particularly labor and materials  and general and administrative costs do generally reflect inflationary trends 
the partnership is subject to a gross income tax as a result of its election to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than to be taxed as a corporation  as allowed by the taxpayer relief act of this tax is calculated at on partnership gross income net revenues less cost of goods sold beginning in the gross income tax was  in   in  and  in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in compared with million in and million in on december  the partnership s working capital was million and its current ratio was to  up from million and to in the higher working capital for is due to the settlement with mauna loa and cost controls 
the partnership is in compliance with the credit agreement covenants 
capital expenditures in were  in capital expenditure were million  all due to the orchards and farming operations acquisition 
there were no capital expenditures in or capital expenditures planned for are less than  and are expected to be financed by way of new equipment leases 
macadamia nut farming is seasonal  with production peaking late in the fall 
however  farming operations continue year round 
as a result  additional working capital is required for much of the year 
the partnership meets its working capital needs with cash on hand  and when necessary  through short term borrowings under a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit was obtained on may  and expires may  at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  the cash balance was  at the end of  and the line of credit drawings were  at december  it is the opinion of management that the partnership has adequate cash on hand and borrowing capacity available to meet anticipated working capital needs for operations as presently conducted 
however  with the september sale of mauna loa  the managing partner no longer has control over the timing of nut payments to the partnership 
the nut purchase contracts require mauna loa to make nut payments days after the end of each quarter 
during certain parts of the year  if payments are not received  as the contracts require  available cash resources could be depleted 
in january  mauna loa notified the partnership that it would not be able to pay the partnership in full on the due date for fourth quarter deliveries 
on january   the partnership received a payment of million on a total receivable of million and issued a notice of nonperformance to mauna loa  providing days to remedy the nonperformance 
in february and march  additional payments were received totaling  leaving an unpaid past due balance of approximately million 
on march  mauna loa was provided with a notice of default 
additionally  nuts deliveries have continued in the first quarter of amounting to million  which will be due on april  mauna loa has represented to partnership management that it is willing and able to pay the past due balance plus contractual interest over the next days 
as such  management believes that the receivable is collectible and has not established an allowance for this account 
the partnership is assessing various alternatives on the defaulted contracts 
legal proceedings mauna loa 
the partnership is a party to five macadamia nut purchase contracts with mauna loa 
three of these contracts  one written in and two in  require mauna loa to pay for all nuts delivered 
since the inception of these three contracts  mauna loa has always paid for all nuts delivered 
the other two nut purchase contracts were written in and and allow for the deduction of unusable nuts in calculating payment due 
on october   a dispute arose with mauna loa regarding the payment for nuts delivered by the partnership during the year 
in violation of the nut purchase contracts and past practice  mauna loa deducted  for certain substandard nuts related to the and contracts 
a demand letter was sent  litigation ensued and a motion for summary judgment was entered in may against mauna loa  awarding principal  and interest and attorneys fees to the partnership 
settlement discussions followed the judgment in order to avoid an appeal and further litigation 
the partnership agreed to accept principal  interest and portion of its legal fees along with a complete release by both parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the partnership has market risk exposure on its credit agreement due to its variable rate pricing that is based on rates based on libor  the farm credit discount note rate and the farm credit medium term note rate 
as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the applicable rate under the credit agreement will result in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately
