overview in analyzing the financial results of the partnership  the following matters should be considered 
the total gas and electric tg e acquisition was made on april  accordingly  the results of operations for the years ended september  and include tg e s results for the entire period whereas the results for fiscal year only include tg e s results of operations for approximately six months 
the primary use of heating oil  propane and natural gas is for space heating in residential and commercial applications 
as a result  weather conditions have a significant impact on financial performance and should be considered when analyzing changes in financial performance 
in addition  gross margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher profit margins than sales to other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
accordingly  a change in customer mix can affect gross margins without necessarily impacting total sales 
the following is a discussion of the historical condition and results of operations of star gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal this increase was due to a million gallon increase in the heating oil segment and a million gallon increase in the propane segment 
the increase in volume reflects the impact of an additional million gallons provided by acquisitions  which was largely offset by the impact of significantly warmer temperatures and to a much lesser extent by customer attrition in the heating oil segment 
the partnership also believes that a shift in the delivery pattern at the heating oil segment increased volume in fiscal by an estimated million gallons 
temperatures in the partnership s areas of operations were an average of warmer than in the prior year s comparable period and approximately warmer than normal 
the abnormally warm weather made the past heating season the warmest in over a hundred years with temperatures approximately higher than the next warmest year in the century 
sales for fiscal  sales decreased million  or  to approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion for fiscal this decrease was due to million lower propane segment sales and million lower tg e sales partially offset by a million increase in sales at the heating oil segment 
sales decreased largely as a result of lower selling prices which were only partially offset by sales from the higher retail volume in the heating oil and propane segments 
selling prices  in all segments  decreased versus the prior year s comparable period in response to lower product commodity costs 
sales of rationally related products  including heating and air conditioning equipment installation and service and water softeners increased in the heating oil segment by million and by million in the propane segment from the prior year s comparable period due to acquisitions 
tg e s sales also decreased as a result of lower electricity sales from the segment s strategic decision made during fiscal to redirect its resources toward the natural gas deregulated energy markets which tg e believes offers greater potential for new opportunities and profitability 
cost of sales for fiscal  cost of sales decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was due to million of lower cost of sales at the heating oil segment  million lower propane segment cost of sales and a million lower cost of sales in tg e 
cost of sales decreased due to the impact of lower product commodity cost partially offset by the cost of sales for the higher retail volume sales 
rationally related product cost of sales increased by million in the heating oil segment and by million in the propane segment from the prior year s comparable period due to the increase in sales of rationally related products 
tg e cost of sales also decreased due to the lower electricity sales 
while selling prices and supply cost decreased on a per gallon basis  the decrease in selling prices was less than the decrease in supply costs  which resulted in an increase in per gallon margins 
delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million of delivery and branch expenses at the heating oil segment and a million increase in delivery and branch expenses for the propane segment 
delivery and branch expenses increased both at the heating oil and propane segments largely due to additional operating costs associated with increased volumes delivered by acquired companies and due to the impact of price and wage increases 
due to the fixed component of the partnership s cost structure  the significant reduction in volume caused by the extremely warm weather conditions didn t allow the partnership to completely reduce operating expenses in direct proportion to the volume reduction 
the heating oil segment s delivery and branch expense also increased by approximately million due to an increase in the estimate of the accrual required to cover certain insurance reserves 
the increase in delivery and branch expenses was mitigated by the purchase of weather insurance that allowed the partnership to record approximately million of net weather insurance recoveries 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and intangibles other than goodwill related to heating oil and propane acquisitions 
amortization expense would be approximately million higher in fiscal if statement no 
was not implemented 
see accounting principles not yet adopted for a further discussion of the effects of statement no 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to additional general and administration expenses for acquisitions  and for increased compensation expense for tg e 
the increase was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses at the partnership level 
the increased compensation for tg e was incurred for professional staff additions  hiring of personnel for collection efforts and for severance paid to former employees in connection with the relocation of its corporate office to new jersey 
tg e s charge to bad debt expense was approximately million in both periods 
based upon tg e s implementation of new information systems and more stringent credit policies  the partnership believes that tg e s bad debt losses should approximate the experience of the partnership s other two operating segments going forward 
general and administrative expenses were lower at the partnership level due to a reduction in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights previously granted as well as for a million decrease in unit compensation expense 
the decrease in unit compensation expense was due to a reduction in the accrual for units expected to be earned versus the prior year under the partnership s unit incentive plan pursuant to which certain employees were granted senior subordinated units as an incentive for achieving specified objectives which were not achieved in fiscal the partnership has determined that these contingent units will not vest for fiscal general and administrative expenses also included approximately million of incremental expense related to an on going business process redesign project in the heating oil segment 
the heating oil segment is seeking to take advantage of its large size and utilize modern technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
the segment is seeking to create a more customer oriented service company to significantly differentiate itself from its competitive peers 
a core business process redesign project began this past fiscal year with an exhaustive effort to identify customer expectations and document existing business processes 
the customer remains the focal point for change  although significant improvement in operational efficiency is also a goal 
while the critical analysis and redesign of existing business processes continues  the segment has already documented near term opportunities for productivity and cost improvement 
preliminary conclusions indicate that improved processes and related technology investments could have a meaningful impact on reducing the heating oil segment s annual operating costs 
the million incremental expense in the fiscal year largely consisted of consulting fees and travel related expenditures 
the expenses related to the on going business process redesign project will continue into fiscal tg e customer acquisition expense for fiscal  tg e customer acquisition expense decreased million  or to million  as compared to million for fiscal this tg e segment expense is the cost of acquiring new accounts through the services of a third party direct marketing company 
the number of accounts acquired in fiscal through third party direct marketing was lower than in the previous fiscal period due to a more stringent credit profile for accepting new customers than was in place for fiscal interest expense  net for fiscal  net interest expense  increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to additional interest expense for the financing of propane and heating oil acquisitions partially offset by lower interest expense for working capital borrowings 

table of contents income tax expense benefit for fiscal  income tax expense decreased million  or  to a tax benefit of million  as compared to an expense of million for fiscal this decrease was due to the availability of carrying back certain federal tax losses resulting from a change in the tax laws enacted during fiscal year of approximately million and due to lower state income taxes based upon the lower pretax earnings achieved for fiscal year cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle for fiscal  the partnership recorded a million increase in net income arising from the adoption of sfas no 
net loss for fiscal  net loss increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal the increased net loss was due to a million decrease in net income at the heating oil segment and a million increase in the net loss at tg e partially offset by a million increase in net income at the propane segment and a million reduction in the net loss at the partnership level 
the increase in the net loss was primarily due to decreased volume from the impact of the warmer weather  partially offset by a per gallon improvement in gross profit margins  net weather insurance recoveries  the tax benefit of the tax loss carryback and by net income generated from acquisitions

ebitda for fiscal  ebitda decreased million  or to million as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was due to million of less ebitda generated by the heating oil segment and a million decrease in tg e s ebitda partially offset by a million increase in the propane segment and a million increase at the partnership level 
the decrease in ebitda was largely due to the impact on volume of warmer temperatures  partially offset by higher per gallon gross profit margins  net weather insurance recoveries  cost reductions and ebitda generated by acquisitions 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
the definition of ebitda set forth above may be different from that used by other companies 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for the fiscal this increase was due to an additional million gallons provided by the heating oil segment and a million gallon increase in the propane segment 
volume increased in the heating oil and propane segments largely due to the impact of colder temperatures and as a result of additional volume provided by acquisitions 
the propane segment estimates that its volume was adversely impacted by approximately million gallons due to consumer conservation 
temperatures in the partnership s areas of operations were an average of colder than in the prior year and approximately colder than normal 

table of contents sales for fiscal  sales increased million  or  to billion  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was attributable to million provided by the home heating oil segment  a million increase in the propane segment and by a million of increased tg e sales 
sales rose in both the heating oil and propane segments due to increased retail volume and to a lesser extent from increased selling prices 
selling prices increased versus the prior year s comparable period in response to higher supply costs 
sales also increased in the heating oil division by million and by million in the propane division due to increases in the sales of rationally related products including heating  air conditioning and water softening equipment installation and service 
cost of sales for fiscal  cost of sales increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to million of additional cost of sales at the heating oil segment  million of increased tg e cost of sales and a million increase in the propane segment 
the cost of sales for both the heating oil and propane segments increased due to the impact of higher retail volumes sales and as a result of higher supply cost 
in addition  cost of sales increased by million due to the impact of sfas no 
on results 
while both selling prices and supply cost increased on a per gallon basis  the increase in selling prices was greater than the increase in supply costs excluding the impact of sfas no 
 which resulted in an increase in per gallon margins 
cost of sales for both the heating oil and propane segments also increased due to additional sales of rationally related products and as a result of additional service cost due to the colder temperatures 
delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million of delivery and branch expenses at the heating oil segment  and a million increase in delivery and branch expenses for the propane segment 
delivery and branch expenses increased both at the heating oil and propane segments due to additional operating cost associated with higher retail volume sales  inflation and for additional operating cost of acquired companies 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization for heating oil and propane acquisitions and million of increased depreciation and amortization expenses for tg e 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to million of additional tg e general and administrative expenses  and a million increase in general and administrative expenses at the partnership level 
the partnership level increase was primarily due to an accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights previously granted  a million increase in unit compensation expense and for professional fees incurred for the recruitment of certain executive positions 
the million increase in unit compensation expense was incurred under the partnership s unit incentive plan whereby certain employees and outside directors were granted senior subordinated units as an incentive for increased efforts during employment and as an inducement to remain in the service of the partnership 
the increase in fiscal resulted from the increased market price of the subordinated units  which was the basis for calculating unit compensation expense as well as for additional units that vested during fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million in total for the heating oil and propane segments due to increased incentive compensation and for acquisition related expenditures 
the million increase in expenses at tg e was largely due to a million provision to increase its allowance for bad debts representing a million increase over the prior year provision  million of start up and organizational expenses and inclusion of a full year of general and administration expense 
since its acquisition  tg e has struggled with customer credit deficiencies and problems collecting its receivables 
as of september   tg e had more than  terminated customers who collectively owe million  virtually all of which is greater than days old 
this balance includes million of accounts receivable that predated tg e s acquisition by the partnership 
these pre acquisition receivables were assigned no value and are not reflected on tg e s books 

table of contents the partnership allocated substantial resources to a collection effort targeting these terminated accounts 
based on a sample group of accounts preliminary collection results  the partnership added million to tg e s bad debt provision for the year ended september  this brought the total bad debt reserve on terminated accounts to million 
consequently  out of the roughly million owed tg e by terminated accounts  all but million had been reserved at september  in addition  tg e provided a million bad debt provision against its active accounts receivable for the year ended september  bringing the total allowances to million for active accounts at that time 
in the course of  tg e instituted entirely new credit policies including a detailed procedure to approve new accounts 
simultaneously  new information systems were purchased and adopted to tg e s needs 
the new systems are currently being implemented at tg e 
as a result  tg e believes its delinquency levels and bad debt experience will improve 
once the system enhancements are fully in place and all of tg e s customers have gone through the new credit approval procedures  bad debt losses should approximate the experience of the partnership s other two operating segments 
tg e incurred approximately million of start up and organizational expenses involving compliance  legal and data processing costs  which were included in general and administrative expenses in tg e customer acquisition expense for fiscal  tg e customer acquisition expense decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this tg e segment expense is the cost of acquiring new accounts through the services of a third party direct marketing company 
interest expense  net for fiscal  net interest expense increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to additional interest expense for higher working capital borrowings necessitated by the higher cost of product and additional interest expense for the financing of propane and heating oil acquisitions

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the ability of star gas to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions  and other factors  most of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of star gas are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand at september  to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the partnership s working capital lines of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  b growth capital expenditures  mainly for customer tanks and expenditures incurred in connection with the heating oil segment s business process redesign program will be financed  in fiscal  by a combination of the proceeds received from the equity offerings completed during fiscal and the use of the partnership s credit facilities  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by the revolving acquisition lines of credit  long term debt  the issuance of additional common units or a combination thereof 
cash flows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year ended september  was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year the net cash provided from operations of million for fiscal consisted of noncash charges of million  primarily depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million partially offset by the net loss of million 
operating assets and liabilities have decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year  due to the collection of high accounts receivable balances from the cold winter of fiscal year investing activities 
star gas completed twelve acquisitions during the fiscal year ended september  investing million 
this expenditure for acquisitions is reflected in the cash used in investing activities of million along with million invested for capital expenditures 
the million for capital expenditures is comprised of million of capital additions needed to sustain operations at current levels and million for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the heating oil segment s business process redesign program and for customer tanks and other capital expenditures to support growth of operations 
the capital expenditures made for the business process redesign program were largely for the purchase of modern technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
investing activities also includes proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of million largely from the sale of idle properties 
financing activities 
during fiscal  net proceeds of million was raised from the sale of million common units 
in addition  increased bank working capital and acquisition facility borrowings provided funds of million 
cash distributions paid to unitholders of million  debt repayments of million and other financing activities of million reduced the net cash provided by financing activities to million 
as a result of the above activity  cash increased by million to million as of september  financing and sources of liquidity the partnership s heating oil segment has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital purposes  an acquisition facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and for certain improvements and a million insurance letter of credit facility 
the working capital facility and letter of credit facility will expire on june  the acquisition facility will convert to a term loan for any outstanding borrowings on june   which balance will be payable in eight equal quarterly principal payments 
at september   million of working capital borrowings were outstanding 

table of contents financing and sources of liquidity continued the partnership s propane segment has a bank credit facility  which consists of a million acquisition facility  a million parity debt facility that can be used to fund maintenance and growth capital expenditures and an million working capital facility 
the working capital facility expires on september  borrowings under the acquisition and parity debt facilities will revolve until september   after which time any outstanding loans thereunder  will amortize in quarterly principal payments with a final payment due on september  at september   million of acquisition facility borrowings and million of parity debt facility borrowings were outstanding 
the partnership s tg e segment had a bank credit facility  which consisted of a million acquisition facility and a million working capital facility 
the tg e bank facility agreements were terminated in october as a result of the contribution of the stock of tg e to the heating oil segment as of october  this transfer made tg e a wholly owned subsidiary of the heating oil segment 
tg e s future working capital requirements will be financed by the heating oil segment 
at september   million and million were outstanding under the acquisition facility and working capital facility  respectively 
these borrowings were repaid by tg e prior to the stock transfer 
the partnership s bank credit facilities and debt agreements contain several financial tests and covenants restricting the various segments and partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general these tests are based upon achieving certain debt to cash flow ratios and cash flow to interest expense ratios 
in addition  amounts borrowed under the working capital facility are subject to a requirement to maintain a zero balance for at least forty five consecutive days 
due to the impact on operations of the record warm weather conditions experienced during the heating season  the partnership s heating oil segment did not meet certain of its bank facility agreement covenants 
the noncompliance was resolved with an amendment to the heating oil segment s bank facility agreements  signed on april  as a result  the heating oil segment is currently in compliance with these covenants 
future failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of the partnership s various bank and note facility agreements could negatively impact the partnership s ability to incur additional debt and or pay distributions and could cause certain debt to become currently payable 
the partnership had million of debt outstanding as of september  amount does not include working capital borrowings  with significant maturities occurring over the next five years 
the following summarizes the partnership s long term debt maturities during fiscal years ending september million million million million million thereafter million the largest maturity for fiscal was a million payment due on october  under one of the heating oil segment s senior secured notes 
this payment was made on october  from a portion of the equity proceeds raised in fiscal the heating oil segment also has million of senior secured notes maturing in april and the propane segment has million of first mortgage notes maturing in two equal installments in march and september the intention of the partnership  barring any limitation of debt incurrence ability  would be to refinance these maturities along with the other million of debt maturing during fiscal  with a new debt issuance 
the partnership believes that it has available sufficient proceeds from its equity offerings and availability to borrow under its propane acquisition facility to refinance the maturities if a new debt issuance were unsuccessful 
however  funding for future year s debt maturities would be largely dependent upon new debt or equity issuances

table of contents financing and sources of liquidity continued in general  the partnership distributes to its partners on a quarterly basis  all of its available cash in the manner described below 
available cash is defined for any of the partnership s fiscal quarters  as all cash on hand at the end of that quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the business  ii comply with applicable law  any of its debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to the common unitholders and the senior subordinated unitholders during the next four quarters  in some circumstances 
the partnership believes that the purchase of weather insurance could be an important element in the partnership s ability to maintain the stability of its cash flows 
in august  the partnership purchased weather insurance that could provide up to million of coverage for the impact of warm weather on the partnership s operating results for the heating season 
in addition  the partnership purchased a base of million of weather insurance coverage for each year from the amount of insurance proceeds that could be realized under these policies is calculated by multiplying a fixed dollar amount by the degree day deviation from an agreed upon cumulative degree day strike price 
for fiscal  the partnership anticipates paying interest of approximately million and anticipates growth and maintenance capital additions of approximately million

as a result  these assets were not amortized  however  amortization expense would have been increased approximately million  if this goodwill had been amortized for the twelve months ended september  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 the partnership is currently evaluating the fair value of its goodwill that arose in connection with its acquisitions  to determine if the value of these assets are impaired 
it is likely that during the first fiscal quarter of  the partnership will record a charge between million and million to write off a portion of tg e s goodwill pursuant to statement no 
at september   tg e had approximately million of goodwill subject to the provisions of statement no 
the partnership will record the charge  net of taxes  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
star gas evaluates its policies and estimates on an on going basis 
the partnership s consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
the partnership s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
star gas believes the following are its critical accounting policies goodwill intangible assets the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in june statement no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
statement no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
statement no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives  such as customer lists  continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
upon adoption of statement no 
on october   star gas will be calculating amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
star gas uses amortization methods and determines asset values based on its best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
star gas assesses the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which star gas will receive benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate 
in some cases  the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms 
changes in the amortization methods or asset values could have a material effect on results of operations 
statement no 
also requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to be assessed annually for impairment 
these assessments involve management s estimates of future cash flows  market trends and other factors 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  a loss is recorded in accordance with statement no 
intangible assets with finite lives must be assessed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
similar to goodwill  the assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds it future cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset

changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on results of operations 
assumption used in the measurement of the partnership s defined benefit obligations sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions require the partnership to make an assumption as to the expected long term rate of return that could be achieved on defined benefit plan assets and discount rates to determine the present value of the plans pension obligations 
the partnership is currently assuming an rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate of 
the return on plan assets is based  in part  on the underlying asset portfolio and the estimated market returns thereon 
the discount rate is based on long term rates of return on high quality debt securities 
actual results could differ materially from these assumptions which could have a material effect on results of operations and or on the minimum pension obligation that would be required to be recorded 
insurance reserves the partnership s heating oil segment has in the past and is currently self insuring a portion of workers compensation and general liability claims

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its bank credit facilities 
the partnership utilizes these borrowings to meet its working capital needs and also to fund the short term needs of its acquisition program 
at september   the partnership had outstanding borrowings totaling million  of which approximately million is subject to variable interest rates under its bank credit facilities 
the partnership also has interest rate swaps with a notional value of million which swap fixed rate borrowings of to variable rate borrowings based on the six month libor interest rate plus 
in the event that interest rates associated with these facilities were to increase basis points  the impact on future cash flows would be a decrease of approximately million annually 
on october   petro signed mutual termination agreements of its interest rate swap transactions 
petro terminated these obligations and liabilities in advance of its scheduled termination date  august   and received million 
the partnership also selectively uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil  propane and natural gas 
the value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices 
consistent with the nature of hedging activity  associated unrealized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the purchase price the partnership would pay for the home heating oil  propane or natural gas being hedged 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at september   the potential impact on the partnership s hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million  and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million
