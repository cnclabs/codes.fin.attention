item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and our predecessor should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation and note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies from our summary of significant accounting policies  we have identified the following accounting policies that require the exercise of our most difficult  complex and subjective levels of judgment 
our judgments in the following areas are principally based on estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
actual results that are influenced by future events could materially differ from the current estimates 
long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of an impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset  which is based on cash flows from that asset  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
reclamation and mine closing costs the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record the liability for the estimated cost of future mine reclamation and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred and the associated cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
those costs relate to sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pit and support acreage at surface mines 
other costs common to both types of mining are related to removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds  and dismantling preparation plants  other facilities and roadway infrastructure 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits we provide income replacement and medical treatment for work related traumatic injury claims as required by the applicable state law 
we provide for these claims through self insurance programs 
the liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers compensation benefits based on an annual actuarial study performed by an independent actuary 
the actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including development patterns  mortality  medical costs and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
coal mining companies are subject to the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various state statues for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker s pneumoconiosis black lung 
we provide for these claims through a self insurance programs 
our estimated black lung liability is based on an annual actuarial study performed by an independent actuary 
the actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these benefits at december  and  respectively 
effective january   we changed our method of estimating black lung benefits to the service cost method described in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which method is permitted under sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
recently  governmental regulations regarding the federal black lung benefits claims approval process were issued 
these new regulations specifically define the black lung disability as progressive and also expand the definition of pneumoconiosis to mandate consideration of diseases that are caused by factors other than exposure to coal dust 
we believe the change to the sfas no 
measurement methodology better matches black lung costs over the service lives of the miners who ultimately receive the black lung benefits and is more reflective of the recently enacted regulations  which place significant emphasis on coal miners future years of employment in the coal industry 
we previously accrued the black lung benefits liability at the present value of the actuarially determined current and future estimated black lung benefit payments utilizing the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which was also permitted by sfas no 
business we are a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major us utilities and industrial users 
in  our total production was million tons and our total sales were million tons 
the coal we produced in was approximately low sulfur coal  medium sulfur coal and high sulfur coal 
at december   we had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland and west virginia 
we believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans 
in addition  there are substantial unleased reserves on adjacent properties that we intend to acquire or lease as our mining operations approach these areas 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage was consumed by electric utilities with the balance consumed by cogeneration plants and industrial users 
our largest customers in were seminole  tva  and vepco 
we have had relationships with these customers for at least years 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage  including approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal sales tonnage  was sold under long term contracts 
the balance of our sales were made on the spot market 
our long term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices 
in  approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices  also known as scrubbers  to remove sulfur dioxide 
we recently entered into long term agreements with sso to host and operate its coal synfuel production facility  supply coal feedstock  assist with coal synfuel marketing  and provide other services through december  these agreements provide us with coal sales or service fees from sso based on the synfuel facility throughput tonnage  which amount is dependent on the ability of the facility s owners to use certain qualifying tax credits applicable to the facility 
the term of each agreement is subject to early cancellation provisions customary for transactions of these types  including the unavailability of coal synfuel tax credits  the termination of associated coal synfuel sales contracts  and the occurrence of certain force majeure events 
therefore  the continuation of the operating revenues associated with the coal synfuel production facility cannot be assured 
however  we have put in place back up coal supply agreements with each coal synfuel customer  which automatically provide for sale of our coal to them in the event they do not receive coal synfuel 
one of our business strategies is to continue to make productivity improvements to remain a low cost producer in each region in which we operate 
our principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits  equipment  materials and supplies  maintenance  royalties and excise taxes 
unlike most of our competitors in the eastern us  we employ a totally union free workforce 
many of the benefits of the union free workforce are not necessarily reflected in direct costs  but we believe are related to higher productivity 
in addition  while we do not pay our customers transportation costs  they may be substantial and often the determining factor in a coal consumer s contracting decision 
our mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern us we believe this gives us a transportation cost advantage compared to many of our competitors 
results of operations compared with coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volume reflecting increased utility demand  increased activity in the domestic coal brokerage market due to favorable spot price levels and additional revenues from the new gibson county coal mining complex  which opened in late tons sold increased to million for from million in tons produced increased to million for from million for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to the increase in tons sold 
we reflect reimbursement of the cost of transporting coal to customers through third party carriers as transportation revenues and the corresponding expense as transportation expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues increased to million for from million for the increase of million is attributable to additional service fees associated with increased volumes at a third party coal synfuel production facility at our hopkins county coal mining complex 
see the discussion immediately above under business 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from increased sales volumes as well as additional operating expenses associated with a full year of operation at gibson county coal  which opened in late  and difficult mining conditions encountered at several operations 
those difficult mining conditions placed an undue burden on equipment scheduled for replacement  resulting in unanticipated equipment failures and higher maintenance costs 
transportation expenses 
see transportation revenues above concerning the increase in transportation expenses 
outside purchases 
outside purchases increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from increased activity in the domestic coal brokerage market due to improved profit margins on spot coal sales  which resulted in increased volumes at higher purchase prices 
the higher brokerage volumes are largely attributable to short term opportunities in the domestic coal brokerage markets  which are not expected to be material in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher accruals related to the short term incentive plan  combined with additional restricted units granted under the long term incentive plan 
the long term incentive plan accrual is impacted by the increased market value of the common units 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million primarily resulted from additional depreciation expense associated with a full year of operation at gibson county coal  which opened in late interest expense 
interest expense was comparable for and at million and million  respectively 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   we changed our method of estimating our black lung benefits liability 
see the discussion immediately above under workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
ebitda income before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for the million increase was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volumes reflecting increased utility demand during and a full year of operations at gibson county coal  which opened in late  and the increased revenue from the third party coal synfuel facility at hopkins county coal 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda has not been adjusted for unusual items nor the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution  but provides additional information for evaluating our ability to pay mqds 
our method of computing ebitda also may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by us in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
compared with in comparing to  the partnership and predecessor periods for have been combined 
since we maintained the historical cost basis of our predecessor s net assets  we believe that the combined partnership and predecessor results for are comparable with the interest expense associated with the debt incurred concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering is applicable only to the partnership period 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation 
coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in the illinois basin operations and at the restructured pontiki operation  which were directly offset by planned reduced participation in coal export brokerage markets 
tons produced decreased to million for from million for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for decreased to million from million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to planned reduced participation in coal export brokerage markets  which generally have higher transportation costs 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from the introduction of a third party coal synfuel production facility at the hopkins county coal mining complex 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million was a result of a start up expenses related to the opening of the newly developed gibson county coal mining complex during the fourth quarter of  b higher sales volumes in the illinois basin operations  c increased production volumes at the restructured pontiki operation  and d prolonged adverse mining conditions related to a sandstone intrusion at the mettiki longwall mine 
transportation expenses 
see transportation revenues above concerning the decrease in transportation expenses 
outside purchases 
outside purchases declined to million for from million for the decrease of million was the result of lower coal export brokerage volumes 
see coal sales above concerning the decrease in coal export brokerage volumes 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were comparable for and at million 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were comparable for and at million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for compared to million for the increase reflected the full year impact of interest on the million principal amount of senior notes and million of borrowings on the term loan facility in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent transactions occurring on august  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation 
unusual items 
we were involved in litigation with seminole with respect to seminole s termination of a long term contract for the transloading of coal from rail to barge through our mt 
vernon terminal in indiana 
the final resolution between the parties  reached in conjunction with an arbitrator s decision rendered during the third quarter of  included both cash payments and amendments to an existing coal supply contract 
we recorded income of million  which is net of litigation expenses of approximately million and an impairment charge of million relating to the facility s assets 
additionally  we recorded an expense of million consisting of million relating to a settlement and million attributable to contingencies associated with third party claims arising out of our mining operations 
the net effect of these unusual items was million 
see item financial statements 
note unusual items 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes was million for compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a start up expenses related to the opening of the new gibson county coal mining complex during the fourth quarter of  b increased operating expenses as a result of prolonged adverse mining conditions encountered at the mettiki longwall mining complex and c additional interest expense associated with the debt incurred concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering  partially offset by unusual items recorded during see unusual items described above 
income tax expense 
our earnings or loss for federal income tax purposes will be included in the tax returns of the individual partners 
accordingly  no recognition is given to income taxes in our accompanying financial statements 
our predecessor was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of alliance resource holdings 
federal and state income taxes were calculated as if our predecessor had filed its return on a separate company basis utilizing an effective income tax rate of 
ebitda income before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for the million increase was primarily attributable to increased production and sales volumes at the restructured pontiki mine and the unusual items recorded during see unusual items described above  partially offset by increased operating expenses as a result of adverse mining conditions at the mettiki longwall mining complex 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda has not been adjusted for unusual items 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution  but provides additional information for evaluating our ability to pay mqds 
our method of computing ebitda also may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by us in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we generally satisfy our working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major capital improvements or acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and minimum distribution payments 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our obligations and planned expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  some of which are beyond our control 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to a decrease in the benefit of working capital reductions from to net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the decreased use of cash is principally attributable to the liquidation of marketable securities  which was partially offset by increased capital expenditures related to the extension of our pattiki mine into adjacent coal reserves and the addition of a new mining unit at our dotiki mine 
net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for cash used in financing activities during and was a direct result of four mqds of per unit on common and subordinated units outstanding 
additionally  during we made a scheduled debt payment of million 
we have various commitments primarily related to long term debt  operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment  obligations for estimated reclamation and mining closing costs and capital project commitments 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash generated from operations  proceeds from marketable securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the following table provides details regarding our contractual cash obligations as of december  less contractual than after obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases      other long term obligations excluding discount effect of million for reclamation liability      capital projects   capital expenditures capital expenditures increased to million in compared to million in see cash flow above concerning the increase in capitalized expenditures 
during the year  we approved an extension of our existing pattiki mine into adjacent coal reserves 
the extension involves capital expenditures of approximately million during the period and is expected to allow the pattiki mine to continue its existing production level for the next years 
additionally during august  dotiki began construction of a new mine shaft and ancillary facilities  which is expected to be operational in late and will provide a new access for miners and supplies 
we have contractual commitments of million related to these capital projects 
we currently expect that our average annual maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we have raised this average from primarily because of our additional operations at gibson county coal 
we currently expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below 
notes offering and credit facility concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering  the special general partner issued and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations with respect to million principal amount of senior notes due august  senior notes 
the special general partner also entered into  and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations under  a million credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three tranches  including a million term loan facility  a million working capital facility and a million revolving credit facility 
we had borrowings outstanding of million and million under the term loan facility and no borrowings outstanding under either the working capital facility or the revolving credit facility at december   and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rates on the term loan facility at december   and  were and  respectively 
the credit facility expires august the senior notes and credit facility are guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of the intermediate partnership 
the senior notes and credit facility contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including the amount of distributions by the intermediate partnership and the incurrence of other debt 
we were in compliance with the covenants of both the credit facility and senior notes at december  and we entered into agreements with three banks to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million to maintain surety bonds to secure its obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers compensation benefits 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding 
the special general partner guarantees the letters of credit 
related party transactions we purchase coal from affiliates  lease a coal preparation plant and handling facilities at our gibson county coal mining complex  lease coal reserves from our special general partner and its affiliates  provide general and administrative services to an affiliate  and receive reclamation services at our dotiki mine from an affiliate 
our special general partner guarantees our letters of credit and we have a put call option to purchase a mine operation from alliance resource holdings 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note related party transactions and item certain relationships and related party transactions 
accruals of other liabilities we had accruals for other liabilities  including current obligations  totaling million and million at december  and these accruals were chiefly comprised of workers compensation benefits  black lung benefits  and costs associated with reclamation and mine closing 
these obligations are self insured 
the accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation  related regulations and other developments 
thus  from time to time  our results of operations may be significantly effected by changes to these liabilities 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note reclamation and mine closing costs and note pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and be measured at fair value 
we have no identified derivative instruments or hedging activities 
accordingly  this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  it further clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
this statement is effective for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
this statement is effective january   for all goodwill and other intangible assets included in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation for its recorded amount is paid or a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred 
since we historically adhered to accounting principles similar to sfas no 
in accounting for its reclamation and mine closing costs  we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have significant long term coal supply agreements 
virtually all of the long term coal supply agreements are subject to price adjustment provisions  which permit an increase or decrease periodically in the contract price to principally reflect changes in specified price indices or items such as taxes  royalties or actual production costs 
for additional discussion of coal supply agreements  see item business 
coal marketing and sales and item financial statements and supplementary data 
note concentration of credit risk and major customers 
almost all of our predecessor s transactions were  and all of our transactions are  denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions 
the intermediate partnership assumed obligations under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are at variable rates and as a result we have interest rate exposure 
the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the fair values of long term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based upon our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of december   and the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows in thousands fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate      weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate      weighted average interest rate fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate     weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate       weighted average interest rate
