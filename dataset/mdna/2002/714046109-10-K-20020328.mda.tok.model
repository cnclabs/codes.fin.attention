contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods sr 
zero coupon unsecured subordinated convertible operating notes due notes due debentures leases total due in thousands total the interest on the unsecured notes maturing in  originally fixed at  has been swapped to a variable rate based upon the month libor 
for the purposes of this table  the obligation has been calculated using the fixed rate due to the variability in the actual rate 

table of contents as discussed above  the sr 
subordinated notes due have been redeemed by the company as of march  the obligation on the zero coupon convertible debentures reflects the right of the holders to require the company to repurchase some or all of the notes in august  as discussed above 
the company has the option to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock  as discussed above 
included in the lease commitments disclosed in the preceding table is a six year operating lease agreement signed in for a facility in the optoelectronics segment 
at the end of the lease term  the company  at its option  may i renew the lease  ii purchase the property at a price equal to the lessor s original cost approximately million  or iii allow the lease to expire and cause the property to be sold 
the company s ability to cause the property to be sold depends upon its compliance with certain terms of the lease 
under certain conditions  the company would receive any excess of the net sales proceeds over the property s original cost 
in the event that the net sales proceeds are less than the original cost  the company would be required to make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference  subject to a maximum amount 
the company requires cash to pay its operating expenses  make capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay debt service  including principal and interest 
the company s principal sources of funds are from its operations and the capital markets  particularly the debt markets 
the company also anticipates receiving significant cash in the near term from the projected dispositions of its discontinued operations 
in the near term  the company anticipates that its operations will generate sufficient cash to fund its operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest payments on its debt 
depending on the size of the transaction  the company may require funds from external sources for acquisitions that it effects for cash 
the company may also require funds from external sources to refinance the principal of its debt as it matures  particularly the million of zero coupon convertible debentures that holders will have the option to put in and the million of principal that becomes due on its unsecured notes in principal factors that could affect the company s internally generated funds include increased working capital requirements 
deterioration of sales due to continued weakness in certain end markets into which the company sells 
principal factors that could affect the company s ability to obtain cash from external sources include a deterioration in the external credit markets hindering the company s ability to place investment grade commercial paper 
the company s inability to dispose of the fluid sciences and security and detection systems businesses currently being held for sale 
borrowing requirements stemming from potential obligations noted above that would reduce the company s overall borrowing capacity 
the existence of a ratings downgrade that would impact the company s ability to borrow under its receivable securitization program 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s product sales are recorded at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  including certain customer acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the service period 
for equipment leased to a customer under a sales type lease  revenue recognition generally commences when the equipment has been shipped  installed and is ready for use 
the company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or historical trailing twelve month usage 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory write downs 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets and investments for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon its projections of anticipated future cash flows  market conditions  legal factors and operational performance 
while it believes that its future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable 
the company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk and market risk are minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on the company s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly 
for the year ended december   net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and expense totaled  the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately million as of december  and million at december  at december   the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was  and at december  was not significant 
the approximate fair value for 
table of contents foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was  and is recorded in other current assets with the offset to other comprehensive income 
this gain will be recognized in earnings over the next months 
market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation  the company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
as the company s international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s risk from exchange rates is primarily related to non dollar denominated sales in europe and asia 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the derivative instruments held by the company are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
the company s hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
interest rate risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the potential loss in fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive derivative financial instruments within a confidence interval 
the company s computation was based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rate and foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods 
the assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions  which are hedged by derivative financial instruments  were excluded from the model 
the company s computations are based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
the var model estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the derivative instruments held as of december  will deteriorate due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations by more than million 
during the four quarters ended december   the var ranged between million and million  and averaged approximately million 
management periodically reviews its interest rate and foreign currency exposures and evaluates strategies to manage such exposures in the near future 
the company implements changes  when deemed necessary  in the management of hedging instruments which mitigate its exposure 
since the company utilizes interest rate and foreign currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

table of contents forward looking information and factors affecting future performance this report contains forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements including  among others  the factors set forth below 
the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations our operating results could be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products are in downward cycles 
some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical 
industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices 
any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and could harm our business 
for example  in  and with respect to optoelectronics  the first quarter of  the operating results of our optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments were adversely affected by the downturn in the telecom  photography and semiconductor markets 
current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers  which in turn has adversely affected our revenues and business 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete  and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
therefore  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 
in addition  some of our life sciences segment s licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions  which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 
for example  some of our life sciences segment s license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
since we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenue originating outside the united states represented of our total sales from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that sales from international 
table of contents operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results and the market price of our common stock include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as drug discovery  pharmaceutical research  telecommunications  semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  our competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy  integrate acquired businesses into our existing business  or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines 
we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory and other approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 

table of contents some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
accordingly  the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  either through public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
we face aggressive competition in many areas of our business  if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the food and drug administration and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
some of the products produced by our life sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies 
these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities  from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with the fda s regulations or those of similar international agencies  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or the cost of producing these products 
obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products  processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive  we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive 
we own many us and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products 
we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 
third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition to our patents  we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties 
the measures employed to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate 
moreover  some licenses can be terminated or converted to non exclusive arrangements by the licensor if we fail to meet specified performance targets 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making  using or selling our products in the us or abroad 

table of contents we have substantial existing debt and may incur additional debt in the future 
as of december   we had million in outstanding long term indebtedness 
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit and issue additional commercial paper to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
as a result  our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
because a substantial portion of our assets is represented by intangibles  such as goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights and technology licenses  the failure to realize the full value of those assets could adversely affect our results of operations 
as of december   our total assets included billion of net intangible assets 
net intangible assets consist of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights and technology licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
in connection our adoption of sfas no 
 we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from december  instead  these items will be tested on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to realize the full value assigned to those assets 
any realization assessment that results in the write off of a significant portion of our net intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully dispose of our fluid sciences business 
in october  we approved a plan to sell our fluid sciences business 
our ability to successfully dispose of our fluid sciences business and the price we receive upon any such disposition will be affected by  among other things  the performance of the fluid sciences business and the ability of prospective buyers to obtain adequate financing 
the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing will depend on  among other things  the state of the capital markets 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully dispose of our fluid sciences business
