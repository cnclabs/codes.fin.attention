item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgements can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition generally  revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual sales returns  as well as management s estimate of anticipated returns 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
we have one major customer that accounted for approximately  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and  or  of our accounts receivable at june  this customer sells products primarily within north america 
although management believes that this customer is sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows  and or financial condition 
a second major customer accounted for approximately  or of our accounts receivable at june  in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes finished saleable products  work in process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for known or anticipated events 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are not material 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
these statements establish financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march  the company adopted this standard effective july  and  accordingly  those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer being amortized 
this resulted in the exclusion of approximately  in amortization expense for the fiscal year ending june  in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets  including purchased goodwill  will be evaluated periodically for impairment 
on an annual basis  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  we evaluated our recorded goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
income taxes we have accounted for  and currently account for  income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have net long term deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future taxable earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of current tax rates in the respective jurisdictions 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of  for deferred tax assets  which relates to tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable or that a previously reserved deferred tax asset will become realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of  or an increase to  earnings at that time

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term debt consisting of a revolving credit and term loan facility that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit facility 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately  was outstanding under the company s credit facility and term loan with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest that year 
in october  the company entered into an interest rate swap to maintain the value at risk inherent in its interest rate exposures 
this instrument expires on october  this transaction meets the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with the difference between interest rates is included as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of this instrument is not material 
the company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
where appropriate  the company requires that letters of credit be provided on foreign sales

the foregoing could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
