retail electric services electric utility restructuring legislation was adopted in pennsylvania in december and in illinois in december both states  through their regulatory agencies  established a phased approach to competition  allowing customers to choose an alternative electric generation supplier  required rate reductions and imposed caps on rates during a transition period  and allowed the collection of competitive transition charges ctcs from customers to recover costs that might not otherwise be recovered in a competitive market stranded costs 
under the restructuring initiatives adopted at the federal and state levels  the role of electric utilities in the supply and delivery of energy is changing 
provider of last resort polr obligations refer to the obligation of a utility to provide generation services ie  power and energy to those customers who do not take service from an alternative generation supplier or who choose to come back to the utility after taking service from an alternative supplier 
because the choice lies with the customer  these obligations make it difficult for the utility to predict and plan for the level of customers and associated energy demand 
if these obligations remain unchanged  the utility could be required to maintain reserves sufficient to serve of the service territory load at a tariffed rate on the chance that customers who switched to new suppliers decide to come back to the utility as a last resort option 
a significant over or under estimation of such reserves may cause commodity price risks for suppliers 
comed and peco continue to be obligated to provide a reliable delivery system under cost based rates 
the rates for the generation service provided by comed and peco are subject to rate caps or freezes during all or a portion of the transition periods 
comed has entered into a long term power purchase agreement ppa with generation to obtain sufficient power at fixed rates 
peco has entered into a long term ppa with generation to obtain sufficient power at the rates peco is allowed to charge to serve customers who do not choose an alternate generation supplier 
comed 
under the illinois legislation  as of december   all non residential customers were eligible to choose a new electric supplier or elect the power purchase option ppo  which allows the purchase of electric energy from comed at market based prices 
as of december   approximately  non residential customers  representing approximately of comed s annual retail kwh sales  had elected to receive their electric energy from an alternative retail electric supplier ares or had chosen the ppo 
customers who receive energy from an ares continue to pay a delivery charge 
comed s residential customers become eligible to choose a new electric supplier in may in addition to retail competition for generation services  the illinois legislation provided for residential base rate reductions  a sharing with customers of any earnings over a defined threshold and a base rate freeze  reflecting the residential base rate reductions  through january  a residential base rate reduction became effective on august  and a further residential base rate reduction became effective in october a utility may request a rate increase during the rate freeze period only when necessary to ensure the utility s financial viability 
under the illinois legislation  if the earned return on common equity of a utility during this period exceeds an established threshold  one half of the excess earnings must be refunded to customers 
the threshold rate of return on common equity is based on the year treasury bond rate plus in the years through earnings for purposes of comed s threshold include comed s net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the amortization of regulatory assets and goodwill 
as a result of the illinois legislation  at december   comed had a regulatory asset with an unamortized balance of million that it expects to fully recover and amortize by the end of consistent with the provisions of the illinois legislation  regulatory assets may be recovered at amounts that provide comed an earned return on common equity within the illinois legislation earnings threshold 
the earned return on common equity and the threshold return on common equity for comed are each calculated on a two year average basis 
comed did not trigger the earnings sharing provision in or and does not currently expect to trigger the earnings sharing provisions in the years through the illinois legislation also provided for the collection of a ctc from customers who choose to purchase electric energy from an ares or elect the ppo during a transition period that extends through the ctc  which was established as of october  and is applied on a cents per kwh basis  considers the revenue that would have been collected from a customer under tariffed rates  reduced by the revenue the utility will receive for providing delivery services to the customer  the market price for electricity and a defined mitigation factor  which represents the utility s opportunity to develop new revenue sources and achieve cost savings 
the ctc allows comed to recover some of its costs that might otherwise be unrecoverable under market based rates 
as part of a settlement agreement between comed and the city of chicago relating to comed s chicago franchise agreement  comed and chicago agreed to a revised combination of ongoing work under the franchise agreement and new initiatives that total approximately billion in defined transmission and distribution expenditures by comed to improve electric service in chicago  of which approximately million has been expended through december  the illinois legislation also committed comed to spend at least billion during the period through on transmission and distribution facilities outside of chicago  which has been expended as of december  in addition  comed conducted an extensive evaluation of the reliability of its transmission and distribution systems in response to several outages in the summer of as a result of the evaluation  comed has increased its capital and operating and maintenance expenditures on its transmission and distribution facilities in order to improve their reliability 
as a result of comed s commitments to improve the reliability of its transmission and distribution system  comed expects its capital expenditures will exceed depreciation on its rate base assets through at least the base rate freeze will generally preclude rate recovery of and on such investments prior to january  unless comed can offset the additional carrying costs against cost savings  its return on investment will be reduced during the period of the rate freeze and until rate increases are approved authorizing a return of and on this new investment 
in addition  the illinois legislation provides that an electric utility  such as comed  will be liable for actual damages suffered by customers in the event of a continuous power outage of four hours or more affecting  or more customers and provides for reimbursement of governmental emergency and contingency expenses incurred in connection with any such outage 
the legislation bars recovery of consequential damages 
the legislation also allows an affected utility to seek relief from these provisions from the icc where the utility can show that the cause of the outage was unpreventable damage due to weather events or conditions  customer tampering or third party causes 
the illinois legislation also allows a portion of comed s future revenues to be segregated and used to support the issuance of securities by comed or a special purpose financing subsidiary 
the proceeds  net of transaction costs  from such securities issuances must be used to refinance outstanding debt or equity or for certain other limited purposes 
the total amount of such securities that may be issued is approximately billion 
in december  special purpose financing subsidiaries of comed issued billion of notes
