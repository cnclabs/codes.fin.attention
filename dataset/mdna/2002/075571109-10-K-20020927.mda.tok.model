item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
our fiscal year ends on june of each calendar year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of fifo first in  first out cost or market 
in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market  we make certain assumptions based on historical experience and current information 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we will adopt sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
will become effective for us at the beginning of fiscal sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business of accounting principals board no 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for any restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may effect the timing of recognizing any future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  statements of operations data net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other expenses income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and buying costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  while a decrease in comparable store sales of reduced sales by million 
comparable store sales for the first half of fiscal decreased 
comparable store sales for the second half of fiscal decreased 
comparable store sales were positive from july  through september  following the september th terrorist attack  the decrease in comparable store sales was attributed to the following marketplace conditions  missed opportunities in key product categories  a product assortment heavily skewed toward the casual lifestyle  and the move of the production operation from brisbane  california to los angeles  california 
gross profit 
gross profit  which includes the cost of merchandise  buying and occupancy  increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the year from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from negative occupancy expense leverage and reduced merchandise margins 
negative occupancy expense leverage was attributed to the lower sales productivity 
reduced merchandise margins were due to increased production costs related to the move of the production facility to los angeles  california  production delays and charges associated with the write off of fabric of approximately million 
merchandise margins were also reduced by a weaker product sell through  primarily in the first six months of the fiscal year  resulting in an increased level of markdowns and a change in the mix of sales between full price and outlet stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower compensation resulting from a change in our incentive plan  and a favorable settlement on a lawsuit 
in fiscal  we recorded  of expenses related to the tentative resolution of a lawsuit 
the decrease in expenses was offset by negative leverage associated with the decrease in comparable store sales and million of charges related to abandoned information technology projects 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to million in fiscal average cash balances continued to increase  however lower interest rates during fiscal resulted in a reduction in interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the benefits of converting the united kingdom operations into a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  while a decrease in comparable store sales of reduced sales by million 
comparable store sales for the first half of fiscal decreased 
comparable store sales for the second half of fiscal increased 
the decrease in comparable store sales in the first half of fiscal was attributable to missed opportunities in key product categories  our failure to provide a balanced product assortment that addressed our customer needs and increased competition 
the increase in comparable store sales for the second half of fiscal was attributable to broader and more balanced product assortment 
gross profit 
gross profit  which includes the cost of merchandise  buying and occupancy  increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the year from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from negative occupancy expense leverage and reduced merchandise margins 
negative occupancy expense leverage was attributed to the lower sales productivity

as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales  expenses related to an increase in compensation at the corporate office  increase in depreciation expense and  of expense related to a legal settlement 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to million in fiscal due to increases in average cash balances arising from operating results offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to interest on tax free and tax advantaged investments 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a disproportionate amount of our annual net sales in the first half of our fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons compared to the second half of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the first half of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at june   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of june   there were no borrowings under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to and was primarily the result of net income and changes in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary use of these funds was for the opening of new stores  investments in management information systems  the relocation of our distribution center to benicia  california  and the expansion of our corporate offices 
we opened new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal we expect to open approximately to stores in fiscal during fiscal  new store construction costs before tenant allowances averaged  the average gross inventory investment was net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from stock option exercises 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations as of june  amount of commitment expiration period dollars in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases amount of commitment expiration period dollars in thousands total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments revolving line of credit  net of outstanding letters of credit standby letters of credit trade letters of credit   total commercial commitments    as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
risks that may affect results factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following risks relating to our business if we misjudge our customers acceptance of  or demand for  our products  our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted 
our success depends on our ability to develop or select the right products  present a balanced product assortment and manage our inventory with the demand for such merchandise 
our ability to accurately predict the demand for our products is further affected by uncertainties created by the slowed economy  recent international affairs and consumer spending fluctuations 
if we miscalculate our customers product preferences or the demand for our products  we may be faced with significant excess inventory or lack of inventory 
this could result in excess fabric for some products and missed opportunities for others 
this may result in weak sales and markdowns and or write offs  which would impair our profitability 
if we cannot successfully transition our production responsibilities with our new personnel in los angeles  california  we could lose sales and increase our cost of goods 
in march  we shifted the production responsibilities from existing personnel in brisbane  california  to new personnel in los angeles  california 
we have and may continue to experience difficulty in implementing our production processes with these new personnel 
any disruption related to this transition whether due to the hiring and training of new personnel  differences in the techniques and processes used  system integration and implementation or other factors  may affect the timeliness of product deliveries  control of inventory including raw materials  work in process and finished goods and the quality of our merchandise  and could ultimately harm our sales  adversely affect our reputation and result in additional costs 
if we are not able to consistently show increases in net sales and net earnings or are not able to operate on a profitable basis  our stock price may be negatively affected 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate net earnings increases period to period or that we will remain profitable in the future 
in the past five years  profitability rates have varied widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
in particular  in fiscal  we experienced a significantly lower rate of growth in earnings than experienced in the prior three fiscal years 
although we were profitable  in fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a decrease in earnings versus the prior year 
our future results of operations will depend on a number of factors including  but not limited to  our ability to manage and execute the number and timing of new store openings  identify and capitalize upon changing fashion trends  identify  hire and retain qualified management and other personnel  maintain appropriate inventory levels  obtain needed raw materials  identify and negotiate favorable leases for successful store locations  comparable store sales performance  control inventory shrinkage results  control operating costs  and produce finished goods in a timely manner 
in addition  future results of operations will depend on factors outside of our control  such as general economic conditions including the effects of the events of september  and uncertainties related to the ongoing conflicts  availability of third party sourcing and raw materials  and actions of competitors 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials or find manufacturing facilities  our financial condition may be harmed 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture our products 
independent manufacturers make merchandise designed by the bebe in house design team with raw materials purchased from independent mills and other suppliers 
we place all of our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
we compete with many other companies for production facilities and raw materials 
if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials  it would have a harmful effect on our financial condition 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these production facilities and to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we cannot assure that these production facilities will not supply similar raw materials to or manufacture similar products for our competitors 
if we are not able to effectively manage our growth  our profitability may be negatively impacted 
our continued growth depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to identify sites and open and operate new stores on a profitable basis 
we expect to open approximately to stores in fiscal our plan to expand successfully depends on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the following the availability of desirable locations  the ability to identify suitable locations  the ability to negotiate acceptable leases for such locations  the ability to manage the expansion of the store base  the ability to source inventory adequate to meet the needs of new stores  the ability to operate stores profitably once opened  the development of adequate management information systems to support expanded activity  the ability to recruit and retain new employees  the availability of capital  and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending 
in selected markets  we have opened and plan to open flagship stores that will be larger and more expensive to operate than existing stores 
if these flagship stores do not generate sufficient revenues to cover their higher costs  our financial results could be negatively affected 
we cannot assure that we will achieve our planned expansion on a timely and profitable basis 
in addition  most of our new store openings in fiscal will be in existing markets 
these openings may affect the existing stores net sales volumes and profitability 
furthermore  we will need to hire experienced executive personnel to support the planned improvements and expansions of our business 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in hiring such personnel in a time frame necessary to manage and support our expansion plans 
our success depends on our key employees  the loss of whom could disrupt our business 
we depend upon the expertise and execution of our key employees  particularly manny mashouf  the founder  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and majority shareholder 
except for mr 
mashouf  we do not carry key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we lose the services of mr 
mashouf or any key officers or employees  it could harm our business and results of operations 
also  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced employees and utilize all employees strengths 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel  which we expect to continue 
we compete for experienced personnel with companies who have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have experienced significant turnover of our executive management team and retail store personnel 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  or capitalize on such persons expertise  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to effectively upgrade and expand our management information systems  our operations may be harmed 
we have in the past and will continue in the future to make significant investments to improve existing management information systems and implement new systems in the areas of production  merchandise allocation  financial and distribution functions 
we cannot assure that these enhancements will be successfully implemented 
if we fail to implement and integrate such systems  it can have a harmful effect on our results of operations 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites  and all manufacturers are contractually required to comply with such labor practices  we cannot control the actions or the public s perceptions of such manufacturers  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while we do not control their employees employment conditions or the manufacturer s business practices  and the manufacturers act in their own interest  they may act in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us and or employee allegations or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
currently  there are two litigation matters pending that involve labor disputes 
although the amount of liability with respect to these actions cannot be accurately predicted  in the opinion of management  any such liability will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on third party apparel manufacturers  and our sales may be negatively affected if the manufacturers do not perform acceptably 
we develop a significant portion of our merchandise in conjunction with third party apparel manufacturers 
in some cases  we select merchandise directly from these manufacturers lines 
we do not have long term contracts with any third party apparel manufacturers and purchase all of the merchandise from such manufacturers by purchase order 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we cannot assure you that third party manufacturers will not supply similar products to our competitors  will not stop supplying products to us completely or will supply products that satisfy our quality control standards 
our business is seasonal and as a result our sales volumes and levels of profitability fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we tend to generate larger sales and  to an even greater extent  profitability levels in the first and second quarters  which include the fall and holiday selling seasons  of our fiscal year 
if for any reason sales are below seasonal norms during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year our quarterly and annual results of operations would be harmed 
our quarterly financial performance may also fluctuate widely as a result of a number of other factors such as the number and timing of new store openings  acceptance of product offerings  timing of product deliveries  actions by competitors  and effectiveness of advertising campaigns 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
any serious disruption at our major facilities could have a harmful effect on our business 
we currently operate our corporate office in brisbane  california  and a distribution facility in benicia  california 
we also operate a technology support center in sacramento  california  and a design studio and production facility in los angeles  california 
any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to the construction  relocation  employment needs of these facilities  fire  earthquake  terrorist acts or otherwise would harm our operations and could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business  personnel and results of operations 
furthermore  merchandise is typically shipped as soon as possible after receipt in our distribution center using third party carriers 
if these third party carriers are unable to deliver shipments to some or all of our stores in a timely or cost efficient manner or if shipments are slowed due to actual or threats of terrorist attacks  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
if we are not able to successfully develop product lines or new store concepts or acquire businesses that extend our product lines  our ability to expand our revenue base may be impaired 
from time to time  we may introduce new categories of products or new store concepts or acquire businesses 
for example  we have tested a new concept store format  bbsp  soon to be renamed bebe sport  in which our product offering is limited to active inspired sportswear branded with the bebe and bbsp future bebe sport logo 
if this limited product offering is not successful or if the bbsp future bebe sport brand name does not achieve the same recognition as the bebe and bebe moda brand names  our ability to expand into additional markets with this concept store may be impaired 
if we are not able to successfully protect our existing copyrights and trademarks  our ability to capitalize on the value of our brand name may be impaired 
we have to ensure our licensees are using the intellectual property correctly or the goodwill associated with these trademarks will be diluted which will have an impact on our business 
currently  we are protecting our trademarks in litigation  which may result in us posting a material bond 
we are seeking to register our trademarks in targeted international markets  which we believe represents large potential markets for our products 
in some of these markets  local companies currently have registered competing marks  and or regulatory obstacles exist that may prevent us from obtaining a trademark for the bebe name or related names 
in such countries  we may be unable to use the bebe name unless we purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name 
we may not be able to register trademarks in these international markets  purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain trademark  ownership or license rights  it would limit our ability to expand into certain international markets or enter such markets with the bebe name  and to capitalize on the value of our brand 
furthermore in some jurisdictions  despite successful registration of our trademarks  third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us 
legislative actions and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations 
in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as proposed changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and proposed accounting changes by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to increase our internal controls  hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which could cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
proposed changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employees stock options as compensation expense among others  could increase the expenses we report under gaap and adversely affect our operating results 
risks relating to our industry if economic conditions deteriorate  then it could have a negative impact on our business  sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are subject to substantial cyclical variation 
a recession in the general economy or a decline in consumer spending in the apparel industry could harm our financial performance 
consumers generally purchase less apparel and related merchandise during recessionary periods and consumer spending may decline at other times 
any economic slowdown or downturn could harm our financial condition 
we cannot assure that our customers would continue to make purchases during such times 
we face significant competition in the retail and apparel industry  which could harm our sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
the primary competitive factors in our markets are brand name recognition  sourcing strategies  product styling  product quality  product presentation  product pricing  timeliness of product development and delivery to market  store ambiance  customer service  and convenience 
we compete with traditional department stores  specialty store retailers  business to consumer websites  off price retailers and direct marketers for  among other things  raw materials  market share  retail space  finished goods  sourcing and personnel 
because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do  we may lack the resources to adequately compete with them 
if we fail to compete in any way  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to deal with the risks inherent in the fashion and apparel industry  our profitability and brand image may be impaired 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  shifting consumer demands and intense competition 
if we misinterpret the current fashion trends or if we fail to respond to shifts in consumer tastes  demand for bebe products  profitability and brand image could be impaired 
also  we cannot assure that our competitors will not carry similar designs  which would undermine bebe s distinctive image and may harm our brand image 
our future success partly depends on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends  including products  styles  fabrics and colors 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to distinguish ourselves within the women s apparel market 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate because of the small number of shares that can be publicly traded and the low average daily trading volumes 
the vast majority of our outstanding shares of our common stock are not registered and are subject to trading restrictions 
as of june   only  shares of our common stock were available to be publicly traded  and as a result  our average daily trading volumes are relatively low  and our stock price is vulnerable to market swings due to large purchases  sales and short sales of our common stock 
because a principal shareholder controls the company  other shareholders may not be able to influence the direction the company takes 
as of june   manny mashouf  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he alone can control the election of directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to the shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire shares  may discourage acquisition bids  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
this concentration of stock ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose 
basis points a change from the bank s reference rate as of june   our results from operations and cash flows would not be significantly affected 
foreign currency risks 
we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us which are settled in us dollars and  therefore  have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we also operate a subsidiary with a base currency other than the us dollar 
this subsidiary represented less than two percent of total revenues for fiscal year and  therefore  presents only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
