overview the company provides integrated marketing services for its clients  primarily pharmaceutical and life sciences companies 
the company conducts its business throughout the united states us  the united kingdom us  france  germany  hungary and austria 
the company is organized into operating segments based on products and services

the european contract sales segment  similar to the us contract sales segment is responsible for the implementation and execution of outsourced sales programs for prescription pharmaceutical and other life sciences products in europe 
the european contract sales segment maintains and operates the requisite systems  facilities and support services to recruit  train  deploy and manage syndicated and dedicated sales forces  as well as other specialized marketing teams  in each of its geographic markets 
the planning and analytics segment  comprised of the company s health products research hpr subsidiary  is capable of designing product launch programs and monitoring each program s progress to maximize the potential for a product s success 
this is achieved by using proprietary software to analyze data compiled from internal sources and third parties to determine specifically how a targeted strategy can maximize asset utilization and return on investment for our clients 
hpr s distinctive process for developing strategic and tactical resource allocation is predicated upon the linking of services and data through solutions based on doctor level intelligence

the communications segment independently develops and organizes large symposia and congresses that are then sponsored by various pharmaceutical  biotech and life sciences companies and related organizations

with its staff of trained telemarketers  our communications business has the ability to conduct physician awareness programs  focus group recruitment  physician profiling  physician detailing  sampling follow ups  qualification of sales lead  phone surveys  consumer surveys  customer service  compliance building and patient care management on behalf of its clients 
in addition communications is registered with the food and drug administration fda as a secondary repackager  and offers a full complement of warehousing  assembly and packaging  and mailing and distribution services 
during  ventiv established ventiv integrated solutions vis  a separate business unit that focuses on developing comprehensive commercialization services with new and existing clients 
vis integrates the services of ventiv s and other market leading businesses offering alternative solutions for product portfolio management by taking on broad responsibility for analytics  sales  marketing and product management  while allowing partners to retain control of their assets 
business considerations dependence on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries our revenues are highly dependent on promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  including the pharmaceutical  medical device  diagnostics and biotechnology industries 
promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been  and could in the future be  negatively impacted by  among other things  governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental  medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products 
furthermore  the trend in the life sciences industries toward consolidation  by merger or otherwise  may result in a reduction in overall sales and marketing expenditures and  potentially  the use of contract sales and marketing services providers 
dependence on demand for outsourced services in the life sciences industries our business and growth depend in large part on the demand from the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries for the outsourced marketing and sales services 
companies may elect to perform such services internally based on industry and company specific factors such as the rate of new product development and fda approval of those products  number of sales representatives employed internally in relation to demand for or the need to promote new and existing products  and competition from other suppliers 
the decision by the pharmaceutical or life sciences companies not to use  or to reduce the use of  outsourced marketing and sales services such as those that we provide would have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks associated with our contract structures particularly in the us  ventiv has seen an increase in demand from clients for incentive based and revenue sharing arrangements 
under incentive based arrangements  ventiv is typically paid a fixed fee and  in addition  has an opportunity to increase its earnings based on the market performance of the products being detailed in relation to targeted sales volumes  sales force performance metrics or a combination thereof 
under revenue sharing arrangements  ventiv s compensation is based on the market performance of the products being detailed  usually expressed as a percentage of product sales 
these types of arrangements transfer some market risk from clients to the company 
in addition  these arrangements can result in variability in revenue and earnings due to seasonality of product usage  changes in market share  new product introductions  overall promotional efforts and other market related factors 
we provide services to many of our most significant clients under contracts that our clients may cancel  typically on to days notice 
in addition  many of these contracts provide our clients with the opportunity to internalize the sales forces sales force conversion under contract  with sufficient notice 
also  although the company has been successful in negotiating longer term commitments  the company cannot be assured that clients will renew relationships beyond the expiration date of existing contracts 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our most significant clients will continue to do business with us over the long term 
if any of our significant clients elect to cancel  convert or not renew their contracts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risk associated with our international operations ventiv has a number of operations in the uk and continental europe 
the following are the material risks inherent in conducting our international operations 
difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  
effects of governmental regulation on the demand for pharmaceutical products  particularly new products  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
foreign currency risk  and 
the risk of economic downturn in non us locations where ventiv does business 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our worldwide revenues in were generated from operations outside of the united states  of which were denominated in british pounds  in german marks and in french francs 
the us dollar value of our foreign generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound  and effective january   the euro in lieu of the french franc and german mark  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we continually evaluate our exposure to exchange rate risk but do not currently hedge this risk 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of our business infrastructure and resources our ability to grow depends to a significant degree on our ability to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure to perform services for our clients  as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services 
our growth will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the high quality of the services we provide to our customers and to increase our penetration with existing customers  to recruit  motivate and retain qualified personnel  and to economically train existing sales representatives and recruit new sales representatives 
we will also be required to implement operational and financial systems and additional management resources to operate efficiently and effectively regardless of market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or expand our operations effectively to address current demand and market conditions 
if we are unable to manage our infrastructure and resources effectively  this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on technology  risk of business interruption we have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet many of our clients needs 
we have also invested significantly in sophisticated end user databases and software that enable us to market our clients products to targeted markets 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology and end user databases on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness 
in addition  our business is dependent on our computer equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of these equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur in any such event 
government regulation of handling and distribution of pharmaceutical samples in connection with the handling and distribution of samples of pharmaceutical products  we are subject to regulation by the prescription drug marketing act of and other applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states and certain regulations in the uk  france  germany and the european union 
these laws regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating storage  handling and record keeping requirements for drug samples and by banning the purchase or sale of drug samples 
in certain jurisdictions  including the uk and france  pharmaceutical sales representatives are subject to examination and licensing requirements under local law and industry guidelines 
our physician education services are subject to a variety of foreign  federal and state regulations relating to both the education of medical professionals and the marketing and sales of pharmaceuticals 
in addition  certain ethical guidelines promulgated by the american medical association ama govern the receipt by physicians of gifts in connection with the marketing of healthcare products 
these guidelines govern the honoraria and other items of value which ama physicians may receive  directly or indirectly  from pharmaceutical companies 
ventiv follows similar guidelines in effect in other countries where it provides services 
any changes in these regulations and guidelines or their application could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  loss of licenses and other penalties and could have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
government regulation of pharmaceutical and life sciences industries pharmaceutical manufacturers and the healthcare industry  in general  are subject to significant us federal and state  us  french  hungarian  austrian  german and european union regulation 
in particular  regulations affecting the pricing or marketing of pharmaceuticals could make it uneconomical or infeasible for pharmaceutical companies to market their products through medical marketing detailers 
other changes in the domestic and international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry could also have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
recent business developments on august   vis announced a six year agreement with cellegy pharmaceuticals  inc cellegy to commercialize cellegy s lead product  cellegesic r nitroglycerin ointment  in the united states

for consulting and communications services  ventiv s revenues are generally based on a fixed project amount or a fee for service basis 
costs of services consist of all costs specifically associated with client programs such as salary  commissions and benefits paid to personnel  including senior management associated with specific service offerings  payments to third party vendors and systems and other support facilities and functions specifically associated with client service delivery

revenue was also adversely impacted by the effect of the resizing of the bristol myers squibb  inc bms sales force and lower than expected revenues from the current revenue sharing arrangement 
during the first quarter of  bms reduced the size of the sales force from sales representatives to  and retargeted the detailing efforts to primary care physicians 
in addition  us sales ceased detailing buspar r at the end of the first quarter of  following a court decision affecting bms s patent for this product 
in late june  bms notified us sales of its intent to cease sales force promotion services under this contract effective december  our european contract sales business generated revenues of million in  an increase of from revenues generated by the european businesses represented of total revenues for the year ended december  revenue in europe increased as a result of better utilization of the syndicates sales force capacity in the uk that was not sold in and the positive effect of new client engagements  in germany  particularly with bayer and aventis 
these increases were partly offset by the loss of a dedicated sales force engagement with american home products and the settlement of a customer pricing dispute in france and  to a lesser extent  the overall effect of foreign exchange fluctuations 
communications revenues represented the company s total revenues 
revenues from this business were approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or from the million of revenue recorded in the primary reason for the decrease was primarily the result of declining demand for telemarketing and other direct marketing services

the bms contract yielded lower overall margins than were realized in as a result of lower than expected revenue share results in and the effect of the incremental revenue and operating income recognized in related to contract start up activities and related costs on this engagement incurred in the third and fourth quarters of the bayer contract that commenced in may produced minimal gross profit on a substantial revenue base to date 
the bayer agreement is a risk based contract under which the company receives certain base fees that cover a substantial portion  but not all of the company s expected costs of services under this engagement 
the company is also eligible to receive variable fees that are tied to the performance of the products being promoted 
the variable fees are intended to provide the company with the opportunity to recover the remaining costs and earn sufficient margins on this engagement

the closure of this team resulted in the termination of employees 
the total charge related to the european operations was approximately million 
interest expense ventiv recorded million of interest expense in the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  interest expense increased as a direct result of net borrowings drawn against the company s revolving line of credit  in support of operations  investing activities and in connection with the company s share repurchase program

these leases are capital in nature

lower average operating margins  additional restructurings charges  impairment of intangible assets and certain charges relating to discontinued operations  as more fully explained above  accounted for the overall decline in net earnings 
shares used in computing basic and diluted eps increased by less than million shares in from the increase was the result of the exercise of employee stock options  net of the cancellation of certain restricted stock awards during the year 
during  common stock equivalents relating to employee stock options and restricted stock awards were not included in the calculation of diluted eps as they were anti dilutive to the net loss per share

the costs as a percent of revenue were further reduced by the inclusion of revenue under the bms contract relating to costs incurred in for start up activities 
adjusting for each of these factors  the overall increase in costs of services was consistent with the increase in revenues for the period 
costs of services at ventiv s european sales businesses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in revenue in the uk and france  partially offset by a one time charge to operations for the elimination of a syndicated team in the uk during the first quarter of in addition  costs of services increased slightly in germany  consistent with the revenue growth for that operating unit

accrued payroll  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million  relating to the increase in the number of sales representatives deployed over the course of the year 
unbilled services increased by million during the period  due to the timing of certain billings and payments for services rendered under the bayer and bms contracts 
the company collected all unbilled amounts recognized as of december  from these clients in the first quarter of in the fiscal year ended december   cash flow from operations was positive despite a million decrease in client advances and unearned revenue from the liquidation of the remaining balance of a million advance fixed fee payment received from bms in  and an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services of approximately million  as a result of business growth  particularly in the us contract sales business

the company did not repurchase any of its common stock in on december   ventiv entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility  expiring on december  at december   the company had million outstanding under this line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 
based on the company s financial results for the twelve month period ending september   ventiv was not in compliance with certain covenants under this facility 
accordingly  all amounts due under this facility were classified as current as of december  in the first quarter of  the company repaid all amounts outstanding under this facility 
on march   the company entered into a new asset based lending agreement 
this new revolving credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing amount of million  subject to a borrowing base calculation  revolving basis and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets

under the facility  the company pays an unused commitment fee of 
the company is also subject to certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including  under certain circumstances  maintenance minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and us earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
after consideration of certain significant customer payments received in the first quarter of  net of the repayment of obligations due under the original credit facility  we currently have adequate cash and equivalents available 
accordingly  we believe that our cash and equivalents  cash to be provided by operations and available credit under our new credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements  including projected funding obligations under the cellegy agreement see recent business developments  and planned capital expenditures over the next months and for the foreseeable future 
we plan to focus on internal growth in the near term as the primary means of our expansion  although we may consider acquisition and investment opportunities as they arise  to the extent permissible 
cash provided by operations may not be sufficient to fund all internal growth initiatives that we may wish to pursue 
if we pursue significant internal growth initiatives or if we wish to acquire additional businesses in transactions that include cash payments as part of the purchase price  we may pursue additional debt or equity sources to finance such transactions and activities  depending on market conditions 
in addition  the company may consider divesting certain business units in order to generate cash to support future growth initiatives 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in raising the cash required to complete all acquisition  investment or business opportunities which we may wish to pursue in the future 
the company is subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  specifically that of the british pound  and  subsequent to january   the euro in lieu of the french franc and the german mark 
to date  changes in the exchange rates of the british pound  german mark and french franc have not had a material adverse impact on our liquidity or results of operations 
we continually evaluate our exposure to exchange rate risk but do not currently hedge such risk 
the introduction of the euro has not had a material impact on our operations or cash flows 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the introduction of the euro as we continue to expand our services in europe 
effect of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in the united states and europe  inflation did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for  or new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against this new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of the non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain related intangibles 
under the non amortization approach  goodwill and certain related intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain related intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the provisions of each statement  which apply to goodwill and related intangible assets acquired prior to june   will be adopted by the company on january  we expect the adoption of these accounting standards to result in a reduction of amortization of goodwill and related intangibles commencing january   however  impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and modifies the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas retains the requirements of sfas for evaluation and recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used  but eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to the assets being tested for impairment 
in addition  sfas provides additional guidance for implementing these impairment tests  including discussion on the use of probability weighted cash flow estimation methods when alternative recovery methods may exist  and the establishment of a primary asset approach to determine the estimation period for groups of assets 
in order to create a single accounting model  sfas also provides specific guidance on accounting for disposals of long lived assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale eg through abandonment  exchange for similar productive asset  or in a distribution to owners in a spin off are to be considered held and used until disposed of  with impairment losses recognized at the disposal date 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  sfas continues to require that assets classified as held for sale be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell  with no further depreciation and amortization recorded subsequent to the decision to dispose of those assets 
sfas also provides for the presentation of discontinued operations when net assets held for sale relate to a component of an entity  for which results of operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
a component of an entity held for sale or to be disposed of is presented as a discontinued operation if its operations and cash flows will or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component 
discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable basis  and estimated future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas immediately and has applied such provisions  effective january   for the current fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt for changes in the libor and base lending rates  and we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations 
we do not currently engage in hedging or other market risk management strategies 
long term debt exposure at december  the company had million outstanding under its line of credit  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the risk to the company if libor and or the base lending rate were to increase is that the company would incur additional interest expense if these outstanding loans are renewed at maturity 
based on current borrowing levels  if libor and or the base lending rate were to increase by  the company would incur an additional million of interest expense on an annual basis 
the company does not believe a material risk exists if the libor and or the base lending rate were to decrease  as all of the company s loans under the line of credit have maturities of days or less 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency  the euro 
uncertainties exist as to the effects the euro may have on our european clients  as well as the impact of the euro conversion on the economies of the participating countries 
any negative economic developments which occur in the combined european union economy and the possible devaluation of the euro could have a material negative impact on our business 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities and operations 
for purposes of quantifying the risk associated with fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate  we used a sensitivity analysis model 
we assumed a hypothetical detrimental change of in the exchange rates on our assets  liabilities and revenues denominated in a foreign currency 
a fluctuation was assumed for all exchange rates at december  our material exposures to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on continuing operations are the french franc  british pound and german mark 
approximately  and of our international operations were conducted in france  the uk and germany  respectively
