item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview our primary sources of revenue are net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we generate interest income from our loan portfolio  which consists of consumer  mortgage and commercial loans  and from investments in mortgage backed securities and other short term investments 
we fund our loan portfolio and investments with deposits  advances from the fhlb  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  securitizations  other borrowings  and equity 
noninterest income is primarily made up of revenues generated from the sale and servicing of automobile contracts and mortgage loans 
the primary components of noninterest income include retained interest income on automobile contracts sold  contractually specified servicing fees for the servicing of loans  late charges  gain on sale of automobile contracts and mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous servicing fee income 
since march  we have structured our securitizations as secured financings and no longer record non cash gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income 
instead  the earnings of the automobile contracts in the trust and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of automobile contracts as net interest income 
other components of noninterest income include gains and losses from the sale of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  insurance income  fees related to the sales of investment products such as mutual funds and annuities and fee income from depository accounts 
the primary components of noninterest expense are salaries  credit and collection expenses  and data processing costs 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the rate earned on our interest earning assets and the rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
net interest income increased in as more automobile contracts were held on the balance sheet as we utilized our own liquidity sources and completed public securitizations totaling billion and a conduit financing totaling million accounted for as secured financings 
our decision to account for our securitizations as secured financings by changing the structure of our securitizations was based upon our business philosophy that we approach our business as a portfolio lender rather than as a seller of automobile contracts 
our securitization structure includes a provision that provides us with the right to repurchase automobile contracts at our option 
the percentage of automobile contracts that we may repurchase was increased from to as of march not only does this change provide greater flexibility in managing our cost of funds  we believe that a portfolio basis presentation provides a better understanding of our business and the inherent risks associated with our securitizations 
in addition  by accounting for our securitizations as secured financings we no longer record a retained interest asset upon completion of each securitization  the valuation of which is based upon subjective assumptions

if there was no balance in the previous year  the total change was allocated to volume 
provision for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses that can be reasonably estimated for the loans held on the balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the loans or reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of loans held on balance sheet is reduced through loan sales 
the level of allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of loans held on balance sheet and historical loss trends 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in our owned loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
the provision for credit losses totaled million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in provision for credit losses in and was the result of a higher level of automobile contracts held on balance sheet and chargeoffs related to such contracts as our securitizations in those years were predominately accounted for as secured financings 
of the total million reported in provision for credit losses in  million was for chargeoffs incurred during the period and million represented the increase in the amount of automobile contracts held on the balance sheet 
of the total million reported in provision for credit losses in  million was for chargeoffs incurred during the period and million represented the increase in the amount of automobile contracts held on the balance sheet 
provision for credit losses was reduced by million due to the lower level of allowance held for automobile contracts due to improving asset quality and a million reduction in allowance for mortgage and commercial loans 
the increase in provision for credit losses in was the result of an increase in the amount of reserves on automobile contracts held for sale as million of such automobile contracts were 
table of contents used as collateral for the issuance of notes to a conduit facility in a transaction treated as a secured financing 
in addition  another million of automobile contracts held for sale were expected to be placed in a securitization in the first quarter of that would also be accounted for as a secured financing  and  therefore  the contracts would remain on our balance sheet and higher levels of reserves would be required for probable losses that could be reasonably estimated 
see financial condition allowance for credit losses 
noninterest income automobile lending income we regularly securitize automobile contracts in the public asset backed securities market and retain the servicing rights 
for accounting purposes  these transactions are treated as either secured financings or sales to a securitization trust 
since the first quarter of  we have not completed a securitization that has been accounted for as a sale 
for transactions treated as sales prior to april  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the portfolio of automobile contracts sold less the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
for these securitizations  net interest earned on the automobile contracts sold and fees earned for servicing the automobile contract portfolios are recognized over the life of the transactions as contractual servicing income  retained interest income and other fee income 
the components of automobile lending income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gain on sale of automobile contracts retained interest expense income  net of risa amortization contractual servicing income other fee income total automobile lending income automobile lending income decreased primarily as a result of lower retained interest income and contractual servicing income  offset by an increase in other fee income 
the following table sets forth our automobile contract sales and securitizations and related gain on sales for the year ended december  dollars in thousands contract sales and secured financings sales to securitization trusts secured financings total sales and secured financings gain on sale of automobile contracts hedge gain loss on sale of automobile contracts gain on sale of automobile contracts as a of total revenues net of the write off of outstanding dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
included in gain on sale of automobile contracts 
retained interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared with retained interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  
table of contents respectively 
for accounting purposes  this income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
retained interest income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold  credit losses and the size of the sold portfolio 
the retained interest expense recognized in is the result of higher chargeoff experience on our sold portfolio as well as revised estimates of future charge offs due to continued slowing in the economy 
net chargeoffs on the sold portfolio decreased to million in from million in and million in the increase in retained interest income in compared with was due to decreases in credit losses  offset by a decrease in the average excess spread on the contracts sold and a decrease in the size of the sold portfolio 
the outstanding sold portfolio had a weighted average gross interest rate spread of in compared with and in and  respectively 
the average balance of the sold portfolio was billion in compared with billion in and billion in according to the terms of each securitization  contractual servicing income is generally earned at rates ranging from to per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized 
for accounting purposes  this income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
the decrease in contractual servicing income to million in from million in is due to the decrease in the average balance of the sold portfolio from to other fee income consists primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees on our managed portfolio  including loans securitized in transactions accounted for as sales and secured financings  as well as automobile contracts not securitized 
the increase in other fee income is due to the growth in our average managed portfolio to billion in from billion in and billion in gain on sale  retained interest income and contractual servicing income are not recognized on securitizations accounted for as secured financings 
therefore  we expect such income will not be recognized on our future securitizations 
retained interest income and contractual servicing income will continue to be recognized on existing securitizations accounted for as sales and will decline as the balance of those pools decreases 
even as these amounts decrease  we expect net interest income will increase as we retain automobile contracts on our balance sheet

table of contents mortgage banking income mortgage banking operations included gains and losses on the sale of loans and servicing rights  loan servicing income net of amortization of capitalized servicing rights and other income  primarily late charges 
during  mortgage banking income totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in mortgage banking income from to is due to our decision to exit the mortgage banking business 
this decision resulted in the sale of our remaining mortgage banking operations in the components of mortgage banking income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net gains from sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights mortgage loan servicing income other fee income total mortgage banking income other noninterest income other noninterest income consists primarily of gains and losses on investments and mortgage backed securities  also known as mbs  and insurance income

income from the sale of mutual funds and annuities is included in insurance income on the consolidated statements of income 
miscellaneous income totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
miscellaneous income in consisted of demand deposit fees  income from rental operations  and other income 
the decrease in miscellaneous income from to was due to a decrease in income from real estate activities attributable primarily to our exit from the mortgage banking business in noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
noninterest expense as a percentage of total revenues improved to in compared to in and in as a result of improved operating efficiencies

table of contents pro forma portfolio basis statements of income during the first quarter of  we changed the structure of our securitizations so that they would no longer be accounted for as sales but rather recorded as secured financings 
this decision is consistent with our business strategy to record high quality earnings and to maintain a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
if treated as secured financings  no gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income is recognized 
instead  the earnings of the automobile contracts in the trust and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of automobile contracts as net interest income 
additionally  no risa is recorded on the balance sheet  which must be written off over the life of a securitization 
this asset is subject to impairment if assumptions made about the performance of a securitization are not realized 
over time  our securitizations that were recorded as sales will mature and an increasing percentage of securitized automobile contracts will be represented by securitizations that are accounted for as secured financings 
in the interim  we will present pro forma portfolio basis statement of operations that present our results under the assumption that all our outstanding securitizations are treated as secured financings rather than as sales 
these statements provide a method by which to gauge our year to year performance while we make this transition 
we believe that such a presentation is an important performance measure of our operations during this transitory period 
differences between portfolio basis earnings and reported earnings represent the transitional effect of treating securitizations as secured financings rather than sales 
ultimately  our reported earnings will approach our portfolio basis earnings as we continue to treat future securitizations as secured financings 
we refer to these pro forma results as portfolio basis statements of operations since all automobile contracts sold would have remained in our on balance sheet automobile contract portfolio if we had accounted for the transactions as secured financings

other than mortgage loans originated through the commercial banking division on a limited basis  we are not adding new mortgage loans to our balance sheet 
our total mortgage loan portfolio consisted of the following december  amount amount dollars in thousands single family residential loans first trust deeds second trust deeds multifamily residential loans construction loans other less undisbursed loan proceeds total mortgage loans

though we continue to focus on expanding our commercial banking operation  it was not a significant source of revenues for the year ended december  amounts due from trusts the excess cash flows generated by automobile contracts sold to each of the securitization trusts is deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitizations 
in addition  at the time a securitization closes  we advance additional monies to our subsidiary that originated the securitization trust to initially fund these spread accounts 
for transactions treated as sales  we establish a liability associated with the use of the spread account funds  which is reduced as such funds reach predetermined funding levels 
we are released from these obligations after the spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
the amounts due from trusts represent amounts due to us that are still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts for transactions treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease is the result of a reduction in the outstanding amount of securitizations treated as sales for accounting purposes 
retained interest in securitized assets risa is capitalized upon the sale of automobile contracts to securitization trusts 
risa represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received by us from the excess spread created in securitization transactions 
the determination of the value of the risa is a critical accounting process 
future cash flows are calculated by taking the coupon rate of the automobile contracts securitized less the interest rate paid to the investors less contractually specified servicing fees and guarantor fees  after giving effect to estimated credit losses and prepayments 
risa is classified in a manner similar to available for sale securities and  as such  is marked to market each quarter 
market value changes are calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using a current market discount rate 
any changes in the market value of the risa are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated statements of financial condition as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the carrying value of the risa in light of the actual performance of the underlying automobile contracts and make adjustments to reduce the carrying value  if appropriate 

table of contents none of our securitizations in were treated as sales 
therefore  we did not record any retained interest in securitized assets in selected original assumptions used to estimate future cash flows for contracts securitized in and were as follows for the three months ended  march june september december a cumulative net credit losses average monthly abs prepayment speed discount rate weighted average remaining maturity in months a b c cumulative net credit losses average monthly abs prepayment speed discount rate weighted average remaining maturity in months at december  and  key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of the risa to immediate and adverse changes in assumed economics were as follows december  dollars in thousands fair value of the risa weighted average remaining maturity of underlying contracts in months abs prepayment speed monthly rate fair value after adverse change fair value after adverse change cumulative net credit losses pool life rate fair value after adverse change fair value after adverse change discount rate annual rate fair value after adverse change fair value after adverse change the following table sets forth the components of the risa for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at the beginning of period additions amortization change in unrealized gain loss on risa balance at end of period the change in unrealized gain loss on risa represents temporary changes in valuation including changes in the discount rate based on the current interest rate environment 
such amounts will not be realized unless the risa is sold 
changes in prepayment and credit loss assumptions for the risa are other than temporary in nature and impact the value of the risa 
such other than temporary differences are immediately recognized in income as a component of retained interest income 
there are no restrictions on the risa 

table of contents the following table presents the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be received from securitizations treated as sales december  dollars in thousands estimated net undiscounted cash flows off balance sheet allowance for credit losses discount to present value retained interest in securitized assets outstanding balance of contracts sold through securitizations off balance sheet allowance for credit losses as a percent of contracts sold through securitizations the decline in the off balance sheet allowance for credit losses both on a dollar and percent basis is the result of our securitizations no longer being treated as sales 
older transactions treated as sales have lower losses each month after securitization as estimated future credit losses are realized 
we believe that the off balance sheet allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in the sold portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
the following table summarizes certain cash flows received from and paid to securitization trusts on securitizations treated as sales for the year ended december  dollars in thousands proceeds excess cash flows from trusts servicing fees received servicing advances repayments on servicing advances the balance of contracts days or more delinquent included in such securitization trusts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
net chargeoffs for these securitization trusts totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
asset quality overview nonperforming assets  repossessions  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by us as key measures of asset quality 
asset quality  in turn  affects our determination of the allowance for credit losses 
we also take into consideration general economic conditions in the markets we serve  individual loan reviews  and the level of assets relative to reserves in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
automobile contract quality we provide financing in a market where there is a risk of default by borrowers 
chargeoffs directly impact our earnings and cash flows 
to minimize the amount of credit losses we incur  we monitor delinquent accounts  promptly repossess and remarket vehicles  and seek to collect on deficiency balances 
at december   the percentage of managed accounts delinquent days or greater was compared with at december  and at december  we calculate delinquency based on the contractual due date 
net chargeoffs on average automobile contracts managed for the year ended december  were compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in delinquency and credit loss experience is primarily a result of a slowing economy 

table of contents the following table sets forth information with respect to the delinquency of our portfolio of automobile contracts managed  which includes automobile contracts that are owned by us and automobile contracts that have been sold but are managed by us december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands automobile contracts managed period of delinquency days days or more total automobile contracts delinquent and delinquencies as a percentage of automobile contracts managed the following table sets forth information with respect to repossessions in our portfolio of managed automobile contracts december  number of number of number of contracts amount contracts amount contracts amount dollars in thousands automobile contracts managed repossessed vehicles repossessed assets as a percentage of number and amount of automobile contracts outstanding the following table sets forth information with respect to actual credit loss experience on our portfolio of contracts managed for the year ended december  dollars in thousands automobile contracts managed at end of period average automobile contracts managed during period gross chargeoffs recoveries net chargeoffs net chargeoffs as a percentage of average automobile contracts managed during period 
table of contents cumulative static pool losses are another means of analyzing automobile contract quality 
the cumulative static pool loss of a securitization is the cumulative amount of losses actually recognized  net of recoveries  as to the automobile contracts securitized  up to and including a given month  divided by the original principal balance of the automobile contracts in that securitization 
the following table sets forth the cumulative static pool losses by month for all outstanding securitized pools cumulative static pool loss curves at december  period a b c a b c a b c d a b c prime mix represents the number of months since the inception of the securitization 
represents the original percentage of prime automobile contracts securitized within each pool 

table of contents real estate loan quality the following table of mortgage delinquencies over days by loan type highlights the fact that real estate loan delinquencies have stabilized over the past three years december  amount amount amount past due past due past due over days over days over days dollars in thousands single family multifamily nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  also known as npas  consist of nonperforming loans  also known as npls  chapter bankruptcy accounts greater than days delinquent  repossessed automobiles  and real estate owned  also known as reo 
for those accounts that are in chapter bankruptcy and are contractually past due greater than days  all accrued interest is reversed and income is recognized on a cash basis 
reo is carried at lower of cost or fair value 
npls are defined as all nonaccrual loans 
this includes mortgage loans days or more past due and impaired loans where full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured 
npas increased million to million at december  compared with million at december  at december   npas represented of total assets compared with at december  there were no impaired loans at either december  or when a loan is designated as nonaccrual  all previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed 
for the years ended december   and  interest on nonperforming loans excluded from interest income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses was million at december  compared with million at december  management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
the methodology for determining the level of allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting process 
quantitative analyses include the review of chargeoff trends by loan program and loan type on an owned and managed basis  evaluation of cumulative loss curves on both a managed and sold basis  evaluation of credit loss experience by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the evaluation of the size of any particular asset group  the concentration of any credit tier  the level of non performance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analyses include trends in chargeoffs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossessions or foreclosures  trends in the number of days repossessions are held in inventory  trends in the number of loan modifications  trends in delinquency roll rates  trends in deficiency balance collections both internally and from collection agencies  trends in custom scores and the effectiveness of our custom scores  and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing allowance for credit losses is not an exact science and can be highly judgmental in nature 
the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is not only dependent upon effective quantitative and qualitative analyses  but also effective loan review and asset classification 
we classify our assets in accordance with regulatory guidance 
our multifamily and commercial loan portfolios are evaluated individually while our single family and consumer portfolios are evaluated in pools 
we classify our loan portfolios into five categories pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
based upon our asset classifications  we establish general and specific valuation allowances 

table of contents general valuation allowances are established based on analysis of individual assets or asset pools and other qualitative factors 
specific valuation allowances are established based on analysis of individual assets or asset pools that are classified as loss 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying various factors to loan balances that are classified as pass  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
specific valuation allowances represent loan amounts that are classified as loss 
some assets may be split into more than one asset classification due to fair value or net realizable value calculations 
this approach allows for enhanced analysis as it highlights the need for more allowance than would be generally allocated if held in one classification 
all loans that are to days delinquent are automatically classified as special mention 
real estate loans that are manifesting a weakness in performance are classified as special mention 
any loan that is or more days delinquent is automatically classified as substandard 
real estate loans that are manifesting a significant weakness in performance are also classified as substandard 
any multifamily loan that is impaired is classified as substandard 
any consumer loan where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or any consumer loan where the vehicle has been repossessed by us and is subject to a redemption period is classified as substandard  with the difference between the wholesale book value and loan balance classified as loss 
based upon the process described above  we believe that our allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in our loan portfolios that can be reasonably estimated 
no single loan  borrower or series of such loans comprises a significant portion of the total portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is reduced by net chargeoffs as well as decreases in required allowances due to sales of loans and by lowering the level of required reserves based upon improved loan performance 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by recording amounts to the provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net chargeoffs were million  million and million for the same respective periods 
the increase in the allowance for credit losses was the result of a higher level of automobile contracts held on balance sheet as well as higher chargeoffs due to a slowing economy 
the increase in the percentage of allowance to total loans at december  was the result of an increase in the amount of reserves on automobile contracts held for sale as million of such contracts were used as collateral for the issuance of notes to a conduit facility in a transaction treated as a secured financing 
in addition  another million of contracts held for sale were expected to be placed in a securitization transaction in the first quarter of that would also be accounted for as a secured financing and  therefore  the contracts would remain on our balance sheet and higher levels of reserves would be required for probable losses that could be reasonably estimated 
we applied a reserve factor that would be at a rate not less than our annualized loss experience on automobile contracts on a managed basis 
we have increased our percentage of allowance for credit losses from at december  to at december  as we have experienced higher losses in our owned portfolio due to a slowing economy 
the reserve factor that we applied was consistent with our annualized loss experience of automobile contracts on a managed basis in credit loss experience for automobile contracts on a managed basis increased from in to in we expect our owned loss experience to ultimately be equivalent to our managed loss experience as more of our securitizations are accounted for as secured financings and as the average age of our owned portfolio continues to increase 
additionally  we reduced our reserves for multifamily loans as we continued to experience fewer foreclosures in this portfolio and as we have been able to resell such foreclosed property at better prices due to higher real estate values

capital resources and liquidity overview we require substantial capital resources and cash to support our business 
our ability to maintain positive cash flows from operations is the result of consistent managed growth  favorable loss experience and efficient operations 
in addition to our indirect statement of cash flows as presented under gaap  we also analyze the key cash flows from our automobile lending operations on a direct basis excluding certain items such as the 
table of contents purchase or sale of loans 
the following table shows our operating cash flows from our automobile lending operations for the year ended december  dollars in thousands cash flows from owned loans cash flows from trusts contractual servicing income other fee income less dealer participation operating costs operating cash flows operating cash flows from automobile lending operations improved in compared with and as a result of improved risk adjusted returns on our portfolio as well as improved operating efficiencies 
principal sources of cash we employ various sources to fund our operations  including collections of principal and interest from loans  deposits  securitizations  commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  repurchase agreements  subordinated debentures and other borrowings 
the sources used vary depending on such factors as rates paid  maturities  and the impact on capital 
collections of principal and interest from loans our primary source of funds is the collection of principal and interest from loans originated 
for automobile contracts  these monies are deposited into collection accounts established in connection with each securitization  or into our accounts for contracts not in a securitization 
pursuant to reinvestment contracts entered into in connection with each securitization  we receive access to the amounts deposited into each collection account and the amounts held in the spread accounts for each securitization 
we use those amounts so received in our daily operations to fund the purchase of automobile contracts or to cover the day to day costs of our operations 
if delinquency or chargeoff rates in a securitization exceed established triggers  amounts required to be held in spread accounts will increase  requiring additional pledged collateral 
we may bear additional expense due to an increase in required collateral 
if the reinvestment contracts were no longer deemed an eligible investment  which determination would be made by the rating agencies or fsa  we would no longer have the ability to use this cash in the ordinary course of business and would need to obtain alternative financing  which may only be available on less attractive terms 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to curtail our automobile contract purchasing activities  which would also have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
also  a significant increase in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our collections of principal and interest from automobile contracts 
for real estate loans and mbs  principal and interest are deposited into our own accounts and such amounts are also used in our daily operations 
total loan and mbs principal and interest collections totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in principal and interest collections is primarily due to an increase in the amount of automobile contracts managed 
deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public  commercial enterprises and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
we offer regular passbook accounts  demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  certificate of deposit accounts and individual retirement accounts 
our retail banking division gathers deposits from retail branch locations throughout california

the following table sets forth the amount of our deposits by type at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands no minimum term demand deposit accounts passbook accounts money market accounts noninterest bearing deposits certificate accounts certificates days to five years iras brokered deposits the variety of deposits we offer has allowed us to remain competitive in obtaining funds and provided us the flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand and competitive pressures 
generally  as other financial institutions  we have become more subject to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
our ability to attract and maintain deposits and control our cost of funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions 
the following table summarizes our average certificate and money market accounts outstanding for the year ended december  dollars in thousands average certificate accounts outstanding average interest rate paid on certificate accounts average money market accounts outstanding average interest rate paid on money market accounts deposit accounts  subject to certain fdic attribution rules  are insured by the fdic up to  per customer 
our maturities of certificate accounts greater than or equal to  were as follows december  dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through one year over one year through three years over three years automobile contract sales and securitizations our business depends on our ability to aggregate and sell automobile contracts in the form of asset backed securities 
these sales generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed and to purchase additional automobile contracts 
changes in our asset backed securities program could materially 
table of contents adversely affect our earnings or ability to purchase and resell automobile contracts on a timely basis 
such changes could include a delay in the completion of a planned securitization  negative market perception of us  or failure of the automobile contracts we intend to sell to conform to insurance company and rating agency requirements 
if we are unable to effectively securitize our automobile contracts  we may have to reduce or even curtail our automobile contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
since  we have securitized over billion of automobile receivables in public offerings  making us the fourth largest issuer of such securities in the nation 
for the year ended december   we securitized billion of contracts  as compared to billion for the year ended december  and billion for the year ended december  on march   we completed the issuance of billion of notes secured by automobile contracts 
we expect to continue to use securitizations as part of our liquidity strategy when appropriate market conditions exist 
borrowings and other sources of funds our other sources of funds include commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  sales of securities under agreements to repurchase  other borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we select from among these funding alternatives based on the timing and duration of our cash needs  as well as the costs  maturities and other requirements of each funding source 
the fhlb system functions in a reserve capacity for savings institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances from the fhlb on security of such stock and on certain residential mortgage loans 
the bank has been pre approved for advances up to of its assets  based on remaining availability under credit facilities established by the bank with the fhlb  with hours notice 
such borrowings may be made pursuant to several different programs offered from time to time by the fhlb 
additional funds are available subject to additional collateral and other requirements 
each credit program has its own interest rate  which may be fixed or variable  and range of maturities 
the fhlb prescribes the acceptable uses to which advances pursuant to each program may be put  as well as limitations on the sizes of advances and repayment provisions 
savings associations such as the bank also have authority to borrow from the frs discount window 
frs regulations require these institutions to exhaust all reasonable alternative sources of funds  including fhlb sources  before borrowing from the frs 
federal regulations have been promulgated which connect cra performance with access to long term advances from the fhlb to member institutions 
the bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent cra evaluation 
subordinated capital debentures in and  we issued million of and million of subordinated capital debentures due in and  respectively 
we redeemed the subordinated debentures due during july at december   million was outstanding on the subordinated debentures due  gross of discounts and issue costs

table of contents conduit financing we enter into secured conduit financing transactions using an automobile receivable securitization structure for short term financing needs 
for the year ended december   we issued million of notes secured by automobile contracts through a conduit facility established in december we terminated this facility in march in conjunction with a billion public automobile contract asset backed securitization 
we also established a million conduit facility secured by automobile contracts in september  which we terminated in march on january   we issued million of notes through a conduit facility 
principal uses of cash acquisition of loans and investment securities our most significant use of cash is for the acquisition of automobile contracts  mbs and other investment securities 
during  loan originations totaled billion compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
we purchased billion of mbs and other investment securities during compared with million and million during and  respectively 
payments of principal and interest on securitizations under the terms of our reinvestment contract  we fund quarterly payments of interest and principal to security holders derived from the cash flows received on the securitized automobile contracts that we service 
payments of principal and interest to security holders totaled billion during compared with billion and billion during and  respectively 
amounts paid to dealers consistent with industry practice  we generally pay dealer participation to the originating dealer for each automobile contract purchased 
participation paid to dealers during totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
typically  the acquisition of prime quality contracts higher up the prime credit quality spectrum requires a higher amount of participation paid to the dealer due to increased level of competition for such automobile contracts 
advances to spread accounts at the time a securitization closes  we are required to advance monies to initially fund the spread account 
funds on deposit in each spread account increase through receipt of excess cash flows until predetermined levels are met 
the amounts due from trusts represent funds due to us that have not yet been disbursed from the spread account on securitizations treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december   including initial advances not yet returned  was million compared with million at december  see business transactions with related parties reinvestment contracts 
advances due to servicer as the servicer of automobile contracts sold in securitizations  we periodically make advances to the securitization trusts to provide for temporary delays in the receipt of required payments by borrowers in accordance with servicing agreements 
we receive reimbursement of these advances through payments from the obligors on the automobile contracts or from the trustee at the time a contract liquidates 
operating our business our largest operating expenditure is salaries and benefits paid to our associates 
other amounts include occupancy costs  costs associated with collection and repossession  telephone and data processing costs 
we also use substantial amounts of cash in capital expenditures for automation and new technologies to remain competitive and to become more efficient

table of contents capital requirements the bank is a federally chartered savings bank 
as such  it is subject to certain minimum capital requirements imposed by the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act  also known as firrea  and the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  also known as fdicia 
fdicia separates all financial institutions into one of five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
in order to be considered well capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier or core risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater and not be subject to any ots order

 accounting for business combinations  also known as sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  also known as sfas no 
under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 companies may no longer use the pooling of interest accounting method for business combinations or account for mergers on their financial statements under the traditional purchase method  which required companies to amortize goodwill assets over a specific time period 
instead purchased goodwill will remain on the balance sheet as an asset subject to impairment reviews 
we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january   and they did not have a material effect on our earnings or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  also known as sfas no 
 in which retirement obligations would be recorded as a liability using the present value of the estimated cash flows and a corresponding amount would be capitalized as part of the asset s carrying amount 
the capitalized asset retirement cost would be amortized to expense over the asset s useful life using a systematic and rational allocation method 
the estimate of the asset retirement obligation will change and have to be revised over time 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  if applicable  an accounting change to adopt the standard would be made as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on our earnings or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  also known as sfas no 
 to supercede statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  also known as sfas no 
the basic recognition and measurement model for assets held for use and held for sale under sfas no 
has been retained  however sfas no 
removes goodwill from the scope as goodwill is now subject to the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on differentiating between assets held and used  held for sale  and held for disposal other than by sale 
assets held for sale disposal must be stated at the lower of the assets carrying amounts or fair values and depreciation would no longer be recognized 
assets to be disposed of by sale would be classified as held for sale when management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the assets meeting several strict criteria 
the three step approach for recognizing and measuring impairment of assets to be held and used under sfas no 
remains applicable 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the credit and pricing committee is responsible for setting credit and pricing policies and for monitoring credit quality 
our asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks 
asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the asset liability committee closely monitors interest rate and prepayment risks and recommends policies for managing such risks 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
this analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points on our assets and liabilities and measures the resulting increase or decrease to our net portfolio value  also known as npv 
npv is the discounted value of the future cash flows or paths of cash flows in the presence of options based on volatility assumptions and an arbitrage free monte carlo simulation method to achieve the current market price of all assets minus all liabilities whose value is affected by interest rates changes plus the book value of non interest rate sensitive assets minus the book value of non interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the npv to the market value of our 
table of contents assets as calculated above 
in general  an increase in interest rates would more adversely affect our npv than would a decrease in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our npv sensitivity analysis at december  based on guidance from the ots changes in interest rates npv ratio basis points base case basis points another important measurement of our interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest sensitive assets that reprice versus the amount of interest sensitive liabilities that also reprice within a defined period of time 
we have more interest sensitive liabilities rather than assets repricing in shorter term maturity buckets and more interest sensitive assets rather than liabilities repricing in longer term maturity buckets

includes effect of interest rate swaps designated against deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the automobile contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitizations  we enter into various hedge agreements 
we enter into euro dollar swap agreements and forward agreements in order to hedge our future interest payments on our notes payable on automobile secured financing 
the market value of these hedge agreements responds inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income loss 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the securitization is treated as a secured financing 
these hedge instruments are settled daily  and therefore  there are no related financial instruments on the consolidated statements of financial condition and credit risk related to these hedge instruments is minimal 
as we issued certain variable rate notes payable in  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we have entered into or committed to interest rate swaps as hedges against deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  respectively and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which cash flows on the hedged items affect income 
the asset liability committee monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by our senior management based upon the monitoring activities of the asset liability committee 
the methodology for the determination  valuation and monitoring of our hedges is a critical accounting process 
as a result of our approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance in this regard 
there were no material changes in market risks in the current year compared with the prior year
