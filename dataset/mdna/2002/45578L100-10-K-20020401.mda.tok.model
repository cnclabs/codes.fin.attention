on january   the sec issued financial reporting release no 
 release no 
 commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec s statement contains suggested enhanced md a disclosures covering liquidity  special purpose entities and other off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments  energy and other commodity contracts  and related party and other transactions conducted at arm s length 
the company adopted these suggested disclosures for reporting within this report and related financial statements  footnotes  and md a 
exclusive of operating leases of the company s office facilities and computers and equipment necessary in the ordinary course of the company s business  the company has no special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
the adoption of these disclosure requirements did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  property and equipment  investments  accrued expenses  restructuring  debt covenants  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from the company s professional consulting and implementation services are generally time and material based and are recognized as the work is performed 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
some professional consulting services involve fixed price and or fixed time arrangements and are recognized using contract accounting  which requires the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method  with progress to completion measured by using labor cost inputs and with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins on these projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts billed and unbilled accounts receivable comprise trade receivables that are credit based and do not require collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company records a provision for uncollectible accounts on sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical collection patterns 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future collections  revenue could be overstated 
on an ongoing basis  the company also evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balance s  evaluation of the account s financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  and discussions with the company s account executive for the specific customer and with the customer directly 
based upon this evaluation of the collectibility of accounts receivable  any increase or decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company generates a significant portion of revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the utility industry 
as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable were attributable to software license fees and support and services sales to utility customers 
in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  we have considered the utility industry s financial condition  as well as the financial condition of individual utility customers 
we do not foresee collectibility issues related to the utility industry in general  except for specific customers for which the company has specifically reserved for potential uncollectibility 
the company generated of its revenues during the year ended december  from a single customer  for the mod s dsms project in the united kingdom 
as of december   approximately million of the company s accounts receivable were attributable to this customer 
as announced by the company on january   the mod has suspended all current contractual work on the dsms project as it reviews its priorities against long term resource availability 
the company does not anticipate accounts receivable collectibility issues related to the project s suspension 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable through sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   approximately million of the company s gross billed accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currencies  of which approximately million were denominated in british pounds 
historically  the foreign currency gains and losses on these receivables have not been significant  and the company has determined that foreign currency derivative products are not required to hedge the company s exposure 
if there were a significant decline in the british pound exchange rate  the us dollar equivalents received from our customers could be significantly less than the reported amount 
a decline in the exchange rate of the british pound to the us dollar of from the rate as of december  would result in an exchange loss of approximately million 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company had approximately million of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  which  subject to certain limitations  may be used to offset for income tax purposes against future income through the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income expectations in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis 
property and equipment property  equipment and software purchased for internal use is capitalized and depreciated amortized over estimated useful lives 
reviews are performed  evaluating impairment and technological obsolescence  and any decision to reduce a capital asset s carrying value would be recorded during the period such a determination was made 
no material capital asset write downs have occurred during the prior two fiscal years and none are currently anticipated for the capital assets currently existing on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company expenses  as incurred  the cost for development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products 
following sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been estimated as significant and all software development costs have been charged to research and development in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company has incurred significant research and development costs during the past three years  million or of total revenues  and anticipates continuing to fund research and development activities as necessary in the future 
if the company does not accurately estimate the software development costs incurred or correctly evaluate establishment of technological feasibility  then a material amount of costs currently recorded as research and development expense could be capitalized on the balance sheet and amortized over future periods to match against anticipated revenue recognition 
investments the company attempts to maximize total investment returns while maintaining a conservative investment policy that emphasizes preservation of principal through high credit quality requirements a p  mig a or better  aa or better and maintenance of liquidity with maximum effective maturity of any single issue not to exceed two years 
the company currently classifies all marketable securities as available for sale investments and carries them at fair market value 
at december  and  the gross amortized cost of the company s investments approximated the estimated fair value 
given that the company s investment policy and guidelines restrict investments to non volatile government  agency  and select money market instruments  the company deems it a very low probability that there will be potential impairment on the current existing investments 
accrued liabilities the company records accrued liabilities based upon valid  measurable  approved purchases  commitments and obligations  with definitive receipt of goods or services and known timing 
most of the liabilities accrued are supported by specific invoices or contracts 
for internal commission and bonus amounts  these are payable in the quarter subsequent to when they are earned  necessitating the use of management estimates to record quarter end and year end accrual amounts 
the total accrued balance for internal commissions and bonuses was million and million for the periods ending december  and  respectively 
if the company does not accurately estimate these commission and bonus amounts or if there is a change in the commission or bonus plans  the resultant adjustment could impact the company s reported gross profit and operating margins 
restructuring at december   the company had a balance in accrued liabilities of approximately million related to restructuring charges  with approximately million representing the estimated excess lease costs associated with subleasing redundant san francisco office space  due to the relocation of the company s headquarters and certain administrative functions to atlanta  georgia  in and the company could incur future charges or credits  in the event that the underlying assumptions used to develop the company s estimates of excess lease costs  such as the timing and the amount of any sublease income  change 
currently  the company has sublease arrangements for two of the five redundant san francisco office floors 
the company estimates that two more floors will come under sublease arrangements in and the final floor will come under sublease arrangement in the two floors currently under subleases are projected to generate approximately million in sublease income from through the company estimates that sublease arrangements for all five floors could generate approximately million of sublease income from through if the company is unable to sublease the additional three floors  the shortfall of million of estimated sublease income will generate charges against the company s income from through  with the charge being approximately  conversely  the company could generate higher than estimated sublease income from through  from faster signing of arrangements on those floors currently not under sublease and or from higher than estimated sublease rental rates 
debt covenants the company has an unsecured revolving bank line of credit in the amount of million  which expires on may  as of december   the only use of this line of credit was a million standby letter of credit 
the line of credit contains certain affirmative and negative covenants see k exhibit index  items and for location of copies of the recent bank line of credit amendments 
the company was either in compliance with  or had received waivers for  each of the financial covenants at december   and the company anticipates generating a net loss during the first quarter of  due primarily to the suspension of the mod s dsms project and related restructuring charges the company anticipates taking during the first quarter of a loss during the first quarter of would trigger a default of the profitability covenant within the bank line of credit 
such a default would require the company to maintain a compensating balance  equal to all outstanding credit line and letter of credit usage  with the lender 
other than the existing million standby letter of credit  no other usage of the line of credit is anticipated and the company will be able to fund the compensating balances without negatively impacting the operations of the business 
the company also believes that the lender would provide a waiver if the required compensating balance was maintained  however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with our debt covenants cannot be assured and the lender s actions are not controllable by the company 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved and our line of credit is placed in default  we would not experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations because we are not in reliance of the line of credit  except for our million standby letter of credit 
litigation and contingencies the company has been notified that it is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings associated with employment and other matters 
the company does not believe that it is a party to any legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
the company at times faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with the company s various filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures 
based upon the company s evaluation of its tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company was to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
results of operations operating results the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items in the company s statements of operations percentage of total revenues years ended december  statement of operations data revenues software licensing fees services  and maintenance and other total revenues cost of revenues including  writedown of third party software in gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations gain on sale of investment in tenfold corporation other income expense net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues 
the company s revenues are derived from software licensing fees and from professional services  which include implementation and training services  customer funded development  and support fees 
total revenues decreased from million in to million in  before increasing to million in the decrease in total revenue from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in the revenues from software license fees and professional services 
the increase in total revenue from to was mainly due to an increase in revenues from both software license fees and professional services in the utility market  as well as growth in the mod dsms project 
revenues from software licensing fees were  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
revenues from software license fees decreased from million in to million in this decrease in software license fees was attributable to a change in the nature eg  increase in elements that are to be delivered in the future of licensing agreements executed in  which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue 
revenues from software license fees increased from million in to million in despite overall weakness in the us economy in  the utility vertical continued to be a strong buyer of the company s eam product 
the increase in software license fees in is also attributable to recognition of deferred elements and revenue from contracts 
during  and  the company signed new licensing contracts valued at million  million and million  respectively 
revenues from professional services were  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
revenues from professional services decreased from million in to million in this decrease in service and support revenue in was due to the majority of new license agreements being executed in the last six months of the year 
revenues from professional services increased from million in to million in the increase in professional services revenue in is primarily attributable to customer funded development and services provided under the united kingdom s mod dsms project  as well as implementation and consulting services generated from the new software licensing contracts sold from mid through mid from a geographic perspective  revenue from international customers from sales outside the united states accounted for  and of revenues for  and  respectively 
the majority of the over growth in revenue from international customers was attributable to the mod dsms project 
in the aggregate  the regions identified as emea europe  middle east and africa  canada  and apac australia  asia and the pacific rim represented the following percentages of total revenues emea europe  middle east africa canada apac australia  asia pacific rim total international sales outside us as most of the company s existing contracts are denominated in us dollars  foreign currency fluctuations have not significantly impacted the results of operations 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses have not been significant  and the company has determined that foreign currency derivative products are not required to hedge the company s exposure 
the united kingdom s mod dsms project represented of total revenues for another customer accounted for and of the company s total revenues in and looking forward into  we continue to see softening in key vertical markets as well as lost revenue due to the suspension of the mod s dsms project  partially offset by revenues from the new insite product  resulting in a decrease in overall revenues in over cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of i personnel and related costs for implementation and consulting services  ii training and customer support services  and iii license fees to third parties upon the sale of the company s products containing third party software 
gross profits on license fees are substantially higher than gross profits on services revenues  reflecting the low packaging and production costs of software products compared with the relatively high personnel costs associated with providing implementation  maintenance  consulting and training services 
cost of revenues decreased from million in to million in and decreased to million in as a percentage of total revenue  cost of revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars in cost of revenues was due principally to the decrease in year over year revenues  partially offset by a million write down of third party software available for sale and higher cost of services margins due to fixed and variable cost reductions not matching the service revenue reductions 
the increase in cost of revenues in  as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the million writedown of third party software  as well as the higher cost of services margins 
the decrease in absolute dollars in cost of revenues was due to being higher due to the million third party software writedown and lower cost of revenue margins for software licensing fees and services  partially offset by the increase in year over year revenues 
the decrease in cost of revenues in  as a percentage of revenues  was due to the aforementioned million writedown in  a higher proportion of license fees which have higher gross profit margins than services revenues  and increased gross profit margins in versus for both license fees and services 
the cost of software licensing fees was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross profit margins on software licensing fees were  and respectively for  and the margin is lower  due to the previously noted million third party software writedown 
excluding this writedown the margin would have been approximately 
the improved margin for over is the result of the product mix  where license fees recognized in were less dependent on third party products than in the cost of services revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
gross profit margins on services revenues were  and respectively for  and the decrease in margin in was due to the company s inability to reduce fixed and variable services costs rapidly enough to match the services revenue reduction and maintain margin 
the increase in margin in was a result of improved utilization rates for services personnel and higher realized billable rates per hour 
research and development r d 
research and development expenses consist primarily of i personnel and related costs and  ii computer processing costs  and iii third party consultant fees directly attributable to the development of new software application products  enhancements to existing products including language translations  and the integration porting of indus products to different systems platforms 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  before decreasing to million in  and represented  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the company s higher research and development expense levels in and reflect the company s investment in the recently introduced indus insite internet born product for the mid tier  collaborative asset management market  as well as ongoing development of indus new vision products  such as indusbuydemand and indusknowledgewarehouse  development and implementation of indus hosted products and elearning applications  and full language conversion  such as the empac translation for the japanese utility market 
the company believes that a significant level of investment in r d is essential to remain competitive 
to date  the company has expensed all software development costs as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions  and the costs of advertising  public relations and participation in industry conferences and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  before decreasing to million in as a percent of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expense for over related primarily to the rebuilding of the sales and marketing staff  and expanded advertising and promotional costs  to address the and declines in license fee revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to related to a continuing review and rationalization of ongoing sales and marketing investments in the company s vertical and geographic markets 
this resulted in lower salaries and benefit costs due to reductions in headcount and a more focused advertising and promotion program resulting in lower marketing expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of finance  human resources and administrative operations 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  before decreasing to million in these expenses represented  and of total revenues in those years  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues from to due to the decrease in revenue  the relatively fixed nature of some portions of general and administrative expenses  expenses related to changes in management personnel  and the writedown of million related to an impaired acquired intangible asset 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses in  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  is a result of lower salaries and benefits from reduced headcount and lower lease costs due to the elimination of redundant space in the company s san francisco office see restructuring expenses below 
restructuring expenses 
the company recorded million and million in and  respectively  in restructuring costs in connection with the ongoing relocation of the company s headquarters and certain administrative functions to atlanta  georgia  severance payments related to the elimination of global positions  and charges representing the estimated excess lease costs associated with subleasing redundant san francisco office space 
this relocation was approved by the board of directors in july and includes costs of approximately million for severance pay for employees affected  and approximately million for lease termination costs associated with reducing leased space in san francisco 
due to the excess capacity of available lease space in the san francisco market  lease rates have declined from approximately per square foot at the beginning of to the per square foot range  which is below the company s actual lease cost of per square foot 
the san francisco office leases expire may  as of december   approximately million of these costs were paid 
million was included in other current liabilities and in other non current liabilities at december  in addition  approximately million of other costs related to the restructuring were recorded directly to restructuring expense during no restructuring expenses were incurred in the third or fourth quarters ending september  and december   respectively  and the company does not anticipate taking any significant further restructuring charges related to the relocation of administrative functions to atlanta 
the company could incur future charges or credits  in the event that the underlying assumptions used to develop the company s estimates of excess lease costs  such as the timing and the amount of any sublease income  change 
on january   the company announced that unanticipated mod budget constraints would reduce near term revenues from the dsms project 
on january   the company announced that it has received notification that the mod has suspended all current contractual work on this project  as it reviews its priorities against long term resource availability 
the mod has not advised the company when this review will be completed 
the first quarter of will be a major transition quarter for indus  as the company demobilizes on the mod project 
the company anticipates taking a restructuring charge in the first quarter of to address the impact of the project s suspension 
see footnote  subsequent events  for discussion of restructuring charge 
gain on sale of investment in tenfold corporation 
in march  indus group  inc acquired a interest in tenfold corporation  a private software company for approximately million in cash 
in may  the company sold its interest in tenfold corporation  which resulted in a million gain 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income are primarily generated from the company s investments in marketable securities and interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 
interest and other income increased from million in to million in  before decreasing to million in the increase in net interest income in is a result of a higher interest rate environment in and reductions in interest expenses from the decrease in net interest income in is a result of a lower interest rate environment in and a decrease in the average monthly balances for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for as compared to provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million in and thousand in include federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the income tax benefit of million in relates principally to refundable federal income taxes previously paid as a result of net operating loss carrybacks 
as of december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards  for tax purposes  of approximately million  which  subject to certain limitations  may be used to offset against future income through as of december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million related to stock option deductions 
the tax benefit for this carryforward will be recorded as additional paid in capital as realized 
the company estimates that it can recognize between to million of book income in future periods before the company returns to a regular tax paying position in the us  and up to million of book income can be recognized in future periods before the company will need to recognize a us tax provision 
the company will potentially be in an alternative minimum tax amt position in future periods as it utilizes its nol carryforwards 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of the assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes historical supporting performance and the reported cumulative net losses for the most recent three years  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset at december  net income loss 
the company reported net income of million in  and net losses of million in  and million in the net loss in  as compared to net income in  is due to the million gain on sale of its investment in tenfold corporation in may  reduced revenues in  and an increase in operating expenses of million 
the million reduction in net loss from to is primarily attributable to a million increase in gross margin in  due to a million increase in revenues and to an increase in gross profit margin percentage of total revenues from in to in in addition  operating expenses including restructuring expenses were reduced or million from to  partially offset by million of lower interest income in and the aforementioned million income tax credit in liquidity and capital resources cash provided by used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash generated from positive operating income and positive working capital changes offset the impact of recording the gain on the sale of the investment in tenfold 
in  cash generated from an increase in deferred revenue and the receipt of million in us federal income tax refunds partially reduced the cash used to finance the company s net loss for the period 
in  cash generated from improved working capital management and the receipt of million in us federal income tax refunds were more than sufficient to offset the cash used to finance the company s net loss for the period 
the effect of exchange rate differences on cash was   and  in  and  respectively 
investing activities  consisting primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities  the acquisition of investments and intangible assets  proceeds from sale of investment in tenfold in  and the acquisition of property and equipment  used cash of million and provided cash of million and million  in  and  respectively 
in  the company generated net cash of million for the sales purchases of marketable securities 
capital expenditures were million for and were made primarily to support the company s internal information systems 
financing activities in used million primarily due to purchase of treasury stock  and repayment of the company s line of credit  partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options 
financing activities provided million in and million in  primarily due to the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and an unsecured revolving bank line of credit of million 
the revolving credit facility was renewed on december  and expires on may  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the libor rate plus to 
at december   million in standby letters of credit were outstanding under the bank line of credit 
the company anticipates generating a net loss during the first quarter of  exclusive of a restructuring charge  due primarily to the cancellation of the mod s dsms project 
a loss during the first quarter of would trigger a default of a profitability covenant within our revolving bank line of credit 
such a default would require the company to maintain a compensating balance  equal to all outstanding credit line and letter of credit usage  with the lender  california bank trust 
other than the existing million standby letter of credit  held by our san francisco office landlord  no other usage of the line of credit is anticipated and the company will be able to fund the compensating balance without negatively impacting the operations of the business 
as of december   the company s primary commitments are its leased office space in atlanta  georgia  san francisco  california  and woking  england 
the company leases its office space under non cancelable lease agreements that expire at various times through the company has no guarantees of debt or similar commitments to third parties 
the company has no written options on non financial assets 
other than operating capital leases and the previously mentioned million line of credit  including the million standby letter of credit  the company has no other credit or debt guarantees  standby repurchase agreements  or other commercial commitments 
within some software licensing contracts  the company does provide guarantees that provide for return of specific amounts of license fee payments in the event of product non performance and or failure to meet specific product delivery and or implementation schedules 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements during the next months 
the foregoing statement regarding the company s expectations for continued liquidity is a forward looking statement  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including variable operating results or presently unexpected uses of cash  such as for acquisitions  or to fund losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s cash flow can be exposed to market risks primarily in the form of changes in interest rates in its short term borrowings available under its revolving bank line of credit as well as its investments in certain available for sale securities 
the company s cash management and investment policies restrict investments to highly liquid  low risk debt instruments 
the company currently does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move decrease in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the net fair value of all interest sensitive financial instruments by approximately million at december  we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to some extent  in europe  asia pacific and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  british pounds  euros and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
a hypothetical unfavorable foreign currency exchange move versus the us dollar  across all foreign currencies  would adversely affect the net fair value of foreign denominated cash  cash equivalent and investment financial instruments by approximately million at december
