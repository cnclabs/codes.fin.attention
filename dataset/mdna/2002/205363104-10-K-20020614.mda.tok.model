in the normal course of business  the company may provide certain customers and potential customers with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  the company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations  the probability of which is remote in management s opinion 
the company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee  and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position

the company continues to provide certain services under this contract and is being paid currently for these services 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management periodically evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on available information  experience and trends 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties involved in using these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies consist of revenue recognition on long term  fixed price contracts and outsourcing contracts  outsourcing contract costs  and contingencies 
revenue recognition long term  fixed price contracts revenue on long term  fixed price contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion of services rendered based on the american institute certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the company has applied this method of revenue recognition because projected contract revenues and costs are reasonably estimable based on the company s business practices  methods and historical experience 
this method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates as to resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known and reviewed by management 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on long term  fixed price contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss is determined 
revenue recognition outsourcing contracts revenue on outsourcing contracts is recognized based on the services performed or information processed during the period in accordance with contract terms and the agreed upon billing rates applied to the consumed service metrics 
in some cases  the company bills customers prior to performing the service  resulting in deferred revenue which is reported as a current liability in the consolidated financial statements 
outsourcing contract costs costs on outsourcing contracts are generally expensed as incurred 
however  certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and charged to expense over the life of the contract 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition costs  including the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection and costs associated with installation of systems and processes 
costs incurred for bid and proposal activities are expensed as incurred 
fixed assets acquired in connection with outsourcing transactions are capitalized and depreciated consistent with policies generally applicable to property and equipment 
amounts paid to the client in excess of the fair market value of acquired property and equipment are capitalized as outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the life of the contract 
management regularly reviews outsourcing contract costs for impairment 
terminations of outsourcing contracts  including transfers either back to the client or to another i t provider  prior to the end of their committed contract term are infrequent due to the complex transition of personnel  assets  methodologies  and processes involved with outsourcing transactions 
in the event of an early termination  the company and the client  pursuant to certain contractual provisions  engage in negotiations on the recovery of unamortized contracts costs  lost profits  transfer of personnel  rights to implemented systems and processes  as well as other matters 
to date  any such terminations have resulted in no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contingencies the company is subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
the company consults with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  the company accrues a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company has fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by ensuring costs to service contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
if necessary  the company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
the company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at march   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
