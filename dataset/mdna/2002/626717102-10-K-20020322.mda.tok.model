in  the company earned million  a diluted share 
net income for the three years ended december  included certain special items that resulted in a net benefit of million  a diluted share  in  a net charge of million  
a diluted share  in  and a net benefit of million  
a diluted share  in the special items in included an after tax benefit of million  a diluted share  from the sale of canadian pipeline and trucking assets  and a benefit of million  
a diluted share  from settlement of income tax matters and a reduction of a provincial tax rate in canada 
other special items that decreased earnings in included an after tax charge of million  
a diluted share  for asset impairments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and a charge of million

a share  for a change in accounting for the company s unsold crude oil production 
the special items included after tax gains of million  
a diluted share  from sale of assets  and million  
a diluted share  primarily from settlements of income taxes and other matters 
vs 
excluding special items  income in totaled million  a diluted share  which was million lower than the million  a diluted share  earned in the decline primarily arose from a decrease of million in earnings from exploration and production operations caused by an reduction in realized oil prices during and higher exploration expenses 
the company s north american natural gas sales price declined during to a realized price of per mcf 
production of oil and natural gas were at record levels during  increasing by and  respectively  compared to refining and marketing operations produced record earnings during as income before special items increased by to million 
stronger unit margins in the us during the first half of the year caused the improved results 
the costs of corporate activities  which include interest income and expense and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  excluding special items  compared to million in the million reduction in was primarily due to higher income tax benefits in the current year 
vs 
income before special items in was a company record million  a diluted share 
the results for represented a million improvement compared to income before special items of million  a diluted share  in the improvement primarily arose from record earnings from the company s exploration and production operations  which amounted to million in compared to million in higher sales prices for both crude oil and natural gas were the principal reasons behind the higher exploration and production earnings 
the company s average worldwide sales price for crude oil and condensate was per barrel in and per barrel in the average sales price of north american natural gas improved from per thousand cubic feet mcf in to in earnings from refining and marketing operations increased from million in to million in these results improved due to better unit margins in both the united states and the united kingdom 
the costs of corporate activities were million in  excluding special items  compared to million in the reduction in was primarily due to lower net interest costs and lower compensation expense for awards under the company s stock based incentive plans 
in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment

production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids increased from  barrels per day in to  in  a increase 
natural gas sales volumes totaled million cubic feet per day in  up from million in the improvement in earnings compared to was primarily due to increases in the company s crude oil sales prices and higher sales prices for its north american natural gas production 
production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids decreased in  and natural gas sales volumes fell as declines in the us gulf of mexico more than offset higher oil and gas sales volumes in canada 
higher exploration expenses in compared to partially offset the effects of higher commodity prices

a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states crude oil natural gas canada crude oil natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom crude oil natural gas ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production averaged  barrels per day in   in and  in sales volumes in were slightly higher and averaged  barrels per day 
oil production in the united states declined in  following a decline in the reduction in both years was primarily due to declines from existing fields in the gulf of mexico 
oil production in canada increased in to a record volume of  barrels per day 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved  barrels per day  or  in due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending and a lower oil price 
before royalties  the company s synthetic oil production was  barrels per day in   in and  in production of light oil increased  barrels per day  or  and heavy oil production increased to  barrels per day in with both increases primarily due to the company s acquisition of beau canada exploration ltd 
beau canada in november production at hibernia rose in to  barrels per day due to better operating efficiency  primarily associated with improved handling of gas production 
uk production was down by barrels per day  or  due to declines from the company s existing fields in the north sea 
in  oil production increased in canada 
production at hibernia rose  barrels per day due to improved operations 
heavy oil production in western canada was  barrels per day higher in due primarily to an active drilling program in the early part of the year 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation in canada was down  barrels per day in due to a combination of more downtime for maintenance and a higher net profit royalty caused by higher prices 
production of light oil in canada decreased barrels per day in uk production increased barrels per day in as improved volumes at mungo monan and schiehallion were almost offset by declines at more mature fields in the north sea 
production in ecuador was down barrels per day in due to pipeline constraints 
worldwide sales of natural gas were a record million cubic feet per day in  up from million in natural gas sales were million cubic feet per day in sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the reductions in and were due to lower deliverability from maturing fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas sales in canada in were at record levels for the sixth consecutive year as sales increased to million cubic feet per day 
canadian natural gas sales had increased in the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of beau canada  production in both and benefited from new discoveries in western canada 
natural gas sales in the united kingdom were million cubic feet per day in  up compared to uk natural gas sales in decreased million cubic feet per day from levels 
worldwide crude oil sales prices declined during compared to in the united states  the company s average monthly sale price for crude oil and condensate declined compared to and averaged per barrel for the year 
in canada  the average sales price for light oil fell to per barrel 
heavy oil prices averaged per barrel  down from the average sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field decreased to per barrel 
synthetic oil prices in averaged per barrel  down from a year ago 
average sales prices in the uk averaged per barrel  a decline of  and sales prices in ecuador were down to per barrel 
worldwide crude oil sales prices in were significantly higher than in in the united states  murphy s average sales prices for crude oil and condensate averaged per barrel for the year  above in canada  the average sales price for light oil was per barrel in  an increase of 
heavy oil prices averaged per barrel  up compared to the average sales price for synthetic oil in was per barrel  up 
the sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field increased to per barrel 
uk sales prices averaged higher in at per barrel 
sales prices in ecuador were per barrel in  up from a year earlier 
the company s north american natural gas sales price averaged per mcf for the year compared to in us sales prices averaged per mcf compared to a year ago 
however  the average price for natural gas sold in canada declined to per mcf 
prices in the united kingdom increased to per mcf from in north american natural gas sales prices strengthened during due to supply being short of demand 
a combination of a hotter than normal summer and a colder than normal early winter near the end of in the united states strained an already below normal level of gas storage throughout the country 
natural gas sales prices in the united states increased from and averaged per mcf in compared to in the prior year 
the average price for natural gas sold in canada during increased to per mcf  while prices in the united kingdom increased to 
based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and 
per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected annual exploration and production earnings by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
cost per equivalent barrel during the last three years were as follows 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the united states in both and was attributable to a combination of lower production and higher well servicing costs 
the decrease in canada during  excluding synthetic oil  was primarily due to increased production in all categories 
the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel for canadian synthetic oil in was due to higher maintenance costs 
the increase in unit cost in the united kingdom during was the result of higher costs to maintain mature properties  including ninian  and the increase in ecuador in was due to lower production during the year 
the increase in canada  excluding synthetic oil  was due to an increase in well servicing costs at heavy oil properties offset in part by the effect of higher production at hibernia  where production expenses are lower than in western canada 
the increase for canadian synthetic oil in was due to lower net production caused by a combination of less gross production volumes and an increase in royalty barrels caused by higher oil prices 
based on the company s interest in syncrude s gross production  cost per barrel increased in a lower unit cost in the united kingdom in was due to a favorable impact from higher production at the mungo monan and schiehallion fields 
higher cost per barrel in ecuador in was attributable to both lower production and higher overall operating expenses 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditure totals for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploratory expenditures charged against income dry hole costs geological and geophysical costs other costs undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in was due to record levels of oil and natural gas sales during the year 
the increase in was due to higher production from hibernia field  offshore eastern canada  and higher depreciation rates per unit on production from properties acquired from beau canada in november refining and marketing earnings before special items from refining and marketing operations were a record million in comparable earnings in and were million and million  respectively 
operations in the united states earned million in compared to million in  due to stronger refining margins and a higher percentage of sales through the company s retail stations at wal mart stores 
us operations lost million in the increase in was due to product sales realizations increasing more than the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks 
operations in the united kingdom earned million in  million in and million in the decline in earnings was caused by generally weaker uk refining margins compared to strong refining margins in the united kingdom in led to record earnings for this operation 
the company earned million in from its crude oil trading and transportation business in canada prior to the sale of these pipeline and trucking assets in may the canadian operations earned million and million in and  respectively 
unit margins sales realizations less costs of crude oil  other feedstocks  refining and transportation to point of sale averaged per barrel in the united states in  in and 
in us product sales increased to a record  barrels per day in  following an increase in higher product sales volumes in and were attributable to a combination of higher crude oil throughputs compared to the previous year at the company s us refineries  plus continued expansion of the company s retail gasoline network at wal mart stores 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  in and in sales of petroleum products were up in due to higher volumes sold in the cargo market 
sales volumes in were down compared to  with the decline attributable to lower consumer demand in the united kingdom caused by the large increase in product prices during the year 
both us and us unit margins have been significantly weaker in early  and both operations were experiencing losses during the early part of the year 
based on sales volumes for and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each 
per barrel 
per gallon fluctuation in unit margins would have affected annual refining and marketing profits by million 
the effect of these unit margin fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s exploration and production segments could be affected differently 
special items net income for the last three years included certain special items reviewed in the following paragraphs 
the effects of special items on quarterly results for and are presented on page f of this form k report 

gain on sale of assets after tax gains of million and million were recorded in the second and fourth quarter  respectively  of for the sale of canadian pipeline and trucking assets

provision for reduction in force an after tax charge of million for a reduction in force program was recorded in the first quarter of see note g to the consolidated financial statements 

cumulative effect of accounting change an after tax charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of to account for the company s unsold crude oil production at cost rather than at market value as in the past 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the income loss effects of special items for each of the three years ended december  are summarized by segment in the following table 
millions of dollars exploration and production united states canada united kingdom ecuador refining and marketing united states canada corporate and other cumulative effect of accounting change total income loss from special items capital expenditures as shown in the selected financial information on page of this form k report  capital expenditures  including discretionary exploration expenditures  were million in compared to million in and million in these amounts included million  million and million of exploration costs that were expensed 
capital expenditures for exploration and production activities totaled million in  of the company s total capital expenditures for the year 
exploration and production capital expenditures in included million for acquisition of undeveloped leases  million for acquisition of proved oil and gas properties  million for exploration activities  and million for development projects 
development expenditures included million for the terra nova oil field  offshore newfoundland  million for synthetic oil operations at syncrude in canada  and million for heavy oil and natural gas projects in western canada 
exploration and production capital expenditures are shown by major operating area on page f of this form k report 
refining and marketing expenditures  detailed in the following table  were of total capital expenditures in millions of dollars refining united states united kingdom total refining marketing united states united kingdom total marketing other canada 
total us refining expenditures in included million for clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the meraux refinery 
us refining expenditures in and and uk expenditures during the three years were primarily for capital projects to keep the refineries operating efficiently and within industry standards and to study alternatives for meeting anticipated future clean fuel specifications 
marketing expenditures in the united states primarily included the costs of new stations built at wal mart stores 
uk marketing expenditures in and were primarily for redevelopment of stores and station purchases  expenditures in were primarily for improvements and normal replacements at existing stations and terminals 
other capital expenditures in canada in primarily consisted of the mid year acquisition of the minority interest in the manito pipeline system 
the manito pipeline and other canadian pipeline and trucking assets were sold by the company in may cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in special items decreased cash flow from operations by million in and million in  but increased cash by million in changes in operating working capital other than cash and cash equivalents provided cash of million in  but required cash of million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was further reduced by expenditures for refinery turnarounds and abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling million in  million in and million in cash proceeds from property sales were million in  million in and million in borrowings under notes payable and other long term debt provided million of cash in  million in and million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans amounted to million in  million in and million in property additions and dry hole costs required million of cash in  million in and million in cash outlays for debt repayment during the three years included million in  million in and million in the acquisition of beau canada in november utilized million of cash 
cash used for dividends to stockholders was million in  million in and million in financial condition year end working capital totaled million in  million in and million in the current level of working capital does not fully reflect the company s liquidity position as the carrying values for inventories under last in first out accounting were million below current costs at december  cash and cash equivalents at the end of totaled million compared to million a year ago and million at the end of long term debt was reduced by million during to million at the end of the year  of total capital employed  and included million of nonrecourse debt incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of the hibernia oil field 
the decrease in long term debt in was attributable to repayments of nonrecourse debt  partially offset by other new borrowings 
long term debt totaled million at the end of compared to million at december  stockholders equity was billion at the end of compared to billion a year ago and billion at the end of a summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page f of this form k report 
murphy had commitments of million for capital projects in progress at december   including million related to clean fuels and crude throughput expansion projects at the meraux refinery and million for costs to develop the medusa field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company typically relies on internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
the company anticipates that long term debt will increase during caused by significant capital expenditure commitments  as described in the preceding paragraph  and an expectation that oil and natural gas prices for much of will remain below trading ranges experienced in and early at december   the company had access to short term and long term revolving credit facilities in the amount of million  and also had unused available lines of credit with banks of million 
in addition  the company has a shelf registration on file with the us securities and exchange commission that permits the offer and sale of up to billion in debt and equity securities 
current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
based on the financing arrangements currently available  the company does not expect to have any problems in meeting future requirements for funds 
at december   murphy had million of lease bonus and drilling costs in property  plant and equipment associated with several leases in the eastern gulf of mexico 
the us government has thus far failed to issue the permits needed to develop and produce a large natural gas discovery on company held acreage in this area due to purported environmental concerns of the state of florida 
the company and its co venturers have sued the us government over its failure to issue such permits  and the company cannot predict whether the us government will issue the permits needed to develop the discovery  or whether the company will be compensated by the government in the event the permits are not issued 
environmental the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect the environment and or impose remedial obligations 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including refineries  oil and gas fields  service stations  and terminals  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated million 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency epa that it is currently considered a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites and has also been assigned responsibility by defendants at another superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at the four sites 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps 
additionally  the company could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these or other superfund sites 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites could have a material adverse effect on future earnings 
the company does not expect that future costs for these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
these costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in a lawsuit filed against murphy by the us government is discussed under the caption legal proceedings on page of this form k report 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during and early  prices for oil field goods and services were adversely affected 
although oil and natural gas prices have weakened in the latter part of and into  it is not possible to determine what effect these lower prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements as described in note b on page f of this form k report  murphy adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 effective january  in addition  the company adopted a change in accounting for unsold crude oil production effective january  that resulted in an million charge to earnings for the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all future business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized and reported as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that amortization of goodwill be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
the company adopted sfas no 
immediately and will adopt sfas no 
on january  the company had unamortized goodwill of million at december   which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million for the year ended december  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability must be recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed in service 
when the liability is initially recorded  the company will increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company will recognize transition adjustments for existing asset retirement obligations  long lived assets and accumulated depreciation  all net of related income tax effects  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
after adoption  any difference between costs incurred upon settlement of an asset retirement obligation and the recorded liability will be recognized as a gain or loss in the company s earnings 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january   and its provisions are generally to be applied prospectively 
at this time  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these accounting standards on the company s financial statements  including whether any transitional goodwill impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
significant accounting policies in preparing the financial statements of the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
these accounting policies are described below 

proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange o commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the company 
the company can not predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 

successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
the company also uses proved developed reserves to recognize expense for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs 
costs of exploration wells in progress at year end were not significant 

impairment of properties the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the company can not predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 

income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences in ecuador and malaysia 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets due to management s belief that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 

legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of when the company should record losses for these based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases and capital commitments 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations are shown below 
amounts due millions of dollars total after long term debt operating leases capital commitments total  in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments that expire in future periods is shown below 
commitment expiration per period millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
during and early  increased worldwide demand and disciplined management of supply by the world s producers primarily by members of opec led to stronger oil prices 
due to economic slowdowns in many major countries during  crude oil demand softened leading to significantly weaker sales prices 
in response to lower oil prices  opec and other major oil producers have agreed to reduce oil production in early it is too early to determine whether these production cuts will lead to a meaningful improvement in oil prices 
due to a combination of warmer than normal weather across much of north america during the early winter of and increased gas storage levels  the price of natural gas in early remained below trading ranges during most of the last two years 
in addition  refined product margins in both the united states and united kingdom were extremely weak in early  leading to losses in refining and marketing operations in both areas 
if oil and natural gas sales prices and refining and marketing margins continue at the levels experienced in january  the company expects that future operating results could be near break even 
in such a volatile operating environment  constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for expenditures of million 
of this amount  million or  is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  including million for development of deepwater projects in the gulf of mexico  another is allocated to canada  including million for light oil and natural gas development  million for continued development of the hibernia and terra nova oil fields  and million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations  is allocated to the united kingdom  is allocated to ecuador  and is allocated to other foreign operations  which primarily includes malaysia
