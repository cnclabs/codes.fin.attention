see note c to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the convertible note 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company determines a need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
when the company determines that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable  it measures any impairment based on comparing future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use or sale of the asset and its eventual disposition  to the carrying amount of the asset

the company suffered a decrease in net sales of services in each of its three segments 
in the staff augmentation segment  the decrease is principally attributable to a sharp decline in the telecom industry resulting in lower sales to telecom customers  partially offset by higher sales to information technology customers

cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services as compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of net sales for increased from levels principally as a result of lower sales and gross margin percentages on sales to telecom customers and a decrease in permanent placement fees  partially offset by the company s continued focus on higher margin niche products in the staff augmentation segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is principally a result of a million write off in the fourth quarter of relating to uncollectible funding and service fees receivable  and higher payroll and recruiting costs with respect to non billable staff and investments to expand the infrastructure for the company s human capital management services segment during the first half of  offset partially by initiatives made by management during the second half of to reduce costs

the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on income before taxes and extraordinary gain of million

the company entered into the ibj credit facility in december to provide greater borrowing availability and flexibility 
as described under recent developments amendments to credit facility in this item  the ibj credit facility was amended five times in the ibj credit facility  as amended  has permitted the company to execute its strategy of reducing its higher interest rate debt and improving its balance sheet by retiring senior notes and pik debentures  as more fully described under recent developments repurchase of senior notes and pik debentures in this item except for special accounts  borrowings under the ibj credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a per annum rate equal to either the base commercial lending rate of ibj as announced from time to time but not less than in excess of the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions  plus a margin ranging from if the company s leverage ratio is or less to if the company s leverage ratio is greater than which margin was at december   or libor plus a margin ranging from if the company s leverage ratio is or less to if the company s leverage ratio is greater than which margin was at december

the ibj credit facility currently provides for borrowing availability of up to million based upon a specified percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowings under the ibj credit facility of million and remaining availability based upon then outstanding eligible accounts receivable of million 
the obligations evidenced by the ibj credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of the subsidiaries of the company and by security interests in substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreements evidencing the ibj credit facility contain various financial and other covenants and conditions  including  but not limited to  limitations on paying dividends  engaging in affiliate transactions  making acquisitions and incurring additional indebtedness 
the scheduled maturity date of the ibj credit facility is december  the company intends to seek to extend the ibj credit facility or to seek to obtain alternative financing 
the ibj credit facility permits the use of up to million in loan proceeds to pay the aggregate repurchase prices of senior notes and pik debentures and tax liabilities and costs associated therewith  not more than million of which may be used to pay the repurchase price of pik debentures and these associated costs 
during  the company has reduced its higher interest rate debt and improved its balance sheet by retiring senior notes and pik debentures through public market and privately negotiated transactions and exchanging pik debentures for the new convertible note with a substantially lower interest rate 
in the case of each repurchase and the exchange  the company has incurred tax liabilities for the forgiveness of indebtedness as a result of its retirement of senior notes and pik debentures for consideration that is less than par 
in the first quarter of  the company repurchased million principal amount of senior notes for million and million principal amount of pik debentures for million  the repurchase prices of which were paid from lower interest rate borrowings under the ibj credit facility 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the exchange of million principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at the rate of per annum for its new million convertible note bearing interest at the rate of per annum  plus million in cash 
the total interest savings from these repurchases is estimated to be million annually based upon current market interest rates 
substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income that has been generated by the company through december  is net income attributable to the operations of coi 
accordingly  except for permitted distributions  these assets and net income are restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture governing the senior notes imposes restrictions on coi making specified payments  which are referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
under the indenture  coi is not permitted to make cash distributions to comforce other than to upstream million annually million annually prior to to pay public company expenses  to upstream up to million to pay income tax related to deemed forgiveness of pik debentures to facilitate the purchase or exchange by comforce of pik debentures at less than par  under certain circumstances in connection with a disposition of assets  to upstream proceeds therefrom to repay the pik debentures  and to upstream funds to the extent coi meets the restricted payments test under the indenture as described under note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  coi upstreamed million for public company expenses of comforce 
management believes that million annually if coi has funds available for this purpose will be sufficient to pay comforce s annual public company expenses for the foreseeable future 
during  in connection with its repurchase of senior notes and pik debentures including through their exchange for the convertible note  comforce incurred tax liabilities related to the forgiveness of indebtedness of approximately million  payable from the million permitted to be upstreamed for this purpose 
in  coi also made upstream payments of million to comforce to repurchase pik debentures 
these payments were permitted restricted payments under the indenture governing the senior notes 
as of december   coi had approximately million remaining available for distribution to comforce as permitted restricted payments representing of consolidated net income of coi for the period from january  through december   less the total amount of restricted payments through such date

to date  comforce has paid all interest under the pik debentures and convertible note in kind 
in  the company paid million in interest in kind 
beginning with the interest payment due june   comforce will be required to pay interest on the pik debentures in cash  and beginning with the interest payment due june   comforce will be required to pay interest on the convertible note in cash 
its ability to do so will be dependent on the ability of coi to borrow funds for this purpose under the ibj credit facility and to upstream funds under the restricted payments test 
in addition  comforce s ability to repay the pik debentures and the convertible note at their respective maturity dates in december  or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase dates  will also be dependent on the ability of coi to upstream funds for these purposes under the restricted payments test  unless comforce separately obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds therefor 
the convertible note is convertible into the company s common stock based on a price of per share of common stock  provided that if such conversion would result in a change of control occurring under the terms of the indentures governing the pik debentures or the senior notes  the convertible note will be convertible into shares of non voting preferred stock having a nominal liquidation preference but no other preferences  which in turn will be convertible into common stock at the holder s option at any time so long as the conversion would not result in a change of control 
notice of conversion must be given at least days in advance 
see related party transaction  above 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were intangible assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions 
intangible assets are amortized over a to year period  resulting in an annual non cash charge of approximately million 
effective december   the company ceased recording amortization expense relating to goodwill amounting to approximately million upon its required adoption of a new accounting standard sfas  as described below under impact of recently issued accounting standards 
however  also as described below under impact of recently issued accounting standards  sfas changes the standards under which the company must evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on its books and may cause the company to write off goodwill when it completes its evaluation  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company is obligated under various agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of companies acquired by the company and to sellers of franchised businesses repurchased by the company  subject to the sellers meeting specified contractual requirements 
the maximum amount of the remaining potential earn out payments is approximately  in cash payable through december  the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies or franchised businesses will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the ibj credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations sfas and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and in august the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  the company adopted the provisions of sfas upon issuance 
sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires  commencing december   that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
instead  they will be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas goodwill and intangible assets acquired by the company in its business combinations completed before july  was amortized during the period through december  sfas requires that upon adoption of sfas  the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
the company also adopted sfas and  accordingly  will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment within the first interim period in accordance with sfas any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas and sfas require that the company perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount as defined in sfas exceeds its fair value  the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the fiscal year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  the company has unamortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  which are subject to the transition provision of sfas and sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was million for the year ended december  the company has evaluated the remaining useful lives of its intangible assets that will continue to be amortized and has determined that no revision to the useful lives will be required 
the company expects to complete its initial impairment review of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by the end of the first quarter of and of goodwill by the end of the second quarter the company does not expect that its impairment review of its intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether any transitional impairment losses associated with the company s goodwill will be required to be recognized 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and it applies to all entities 
the company is required to adopt sfas  effective for calendar year the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its future consolidated operations or financial position  as the company is now constituted 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statement  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  the company cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on its financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions  if any 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for technical and engineering services  it and telecom staffing services has historically been lower during the second half of the fourth quarter through the following first quarter  and  generally  shows gradual improvement until the second half of the fourth quarter  however  the company s revenues have declined since the first quarter of as a result of the economic climate generally and in certain of the industries served by the company or other factors 
forward looking statements various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to the following a continuation of the current recessionary environment  particularly in the aircraft manufacturing  telecom and other sectors served by the company which may reflect cyclical conditions or fundamental changes in these industries  could further reduce demand for contingent personnel and further heighten the competition for customers  resulting in lower revenues and margins and affecting the company s ability to continue to meet the financial covenants under the ibj credit facility  the company s significant leverage may leave it with a diminished ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other capital expenditures  for retiring higher interest rate debt or for otherwise improving the company s competitiveness and capital structure or expanding its operations  the recent effectiveness of sfas changes the standards under which the company must evaluate the recoverability of goodwill on its books and may cause the company to write off goodwill  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations  or  if coi fails to generate sufficient consolidated net income or have other funds available to upstream to comforce under the restricted payments test of the senior notes indenture in order for it to pay cash interest on the pik debentures which is required beginning june  or the convertible note which is required beginning june  or to repay the pik debentures or the convertible note at their maturity in december  or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase date  then  unless comforce obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds for this purpose  the company will default under the indentures governing the pik debentures and the senior notes and under the ibj credit facility 
additional important factors that could cause the company to be unable to realize its plans and objectives are described under risk factors in the registration statement on form s of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  registration no 

the disclosure under risk factors in the registration statement may be accessed through the web site maintained by the securities and exchange commission at www 
sec 
gov 
in addition  the company will provide  without charge  a copy of such risk factors disclosure to each stockholder of the company who requests such information 
requests for copies should be directed to the attention of linda annicelli  vice president of administration at comforce corporation  crossways park drive  po box  woodbury  new york  telephone item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations 
during  approximately of the company s interest expense was attributable to variable rate loans  all of which were under ibj credit facility 
the ibj credit facility currently provides for borrowing availability of up to million based upon a specified percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable
