item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains both historical financial information and forward looking statements 
neogen corporation management does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial results 
the words anticipate  believe  potential  expect  and similar expressions used herein are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
various factors  including competition  recruitment and dependence on key employees  impact of weather on agriculture and food production  identification and integration of acquisitions  research and development risks  patent and trade secret protection  government deregulation and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports on file at the securities and exchange commission may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgements and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  and the assessment of the possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
this is generally at the time of shipment 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained based on historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history 
management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the cost of the inventory 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
goodwill and intangible assets management assesses goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment on no less often than an annual basis 
in the event of changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  this assessment may take place at any time 
factors that could cause an impairment review to take place would include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the use of acquired assets or strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the carrying value is compared to a value determined based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
any impairment identified in this computation is given current recognition in any unissued financial statements

revenues from products used for the detection of microbial organisms in food and for tests of general cleanliness  increased from the prior year with the introduction of new products from the gene trak and qa life sciences acquisitions and from continued market penetration 
products for the detection of allergenic substances showed a revenue increase of as the company continues to benefit from its leadership in this market and the high level of customer acceptance of the products 
revenues from businesses acquired during the year qa life sciences and gene trak were  in  sales of food safety products increased due to a full year of sales of acumedia  which was purchased in february and therefore only reported a partial year of sales in  and from increases in sales of microbial and cleanliness tests 
in both and  sales of products marketed to detect mycotoxins in grains had modest increases in sales due to the relative absence of weather conditions that promote the occurrence of mold in commodity crops 
animal safety division sales increased in the triple crown product line sales increased during the year  with sales of the company s animal wound care products showing an increase of 
the company s new stronger and detectable needle and the new relationship with tractor supply company contributed significantly to a increase in sales of veterinary instruments 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of industrial needles and other oem products 
general economic conditions are believed to be the principal cause of this decline in revenue 
in  animal safety division sales increased 
these increases were in part related to the company s early fiscal acquisitions of amvet pharmaceuticals and squire laboratories that added million to revenue 
other revenue increases came from the effect of neogen s distribution which added over million of sales to the revenues of amvet and squire in the equivalent period prior to the acquisitions  and from triple crown product sales that increased over  cost of goods sold dollars in thousands increase increase cost of goods sold    cost of goods sold increased in  compared to an increase in revenues and in compared to a increase in revenues 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold was in  in and in food safety gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
changes in margins between the periods related principally to product mix with manufactured test kits generally having higher margins than products which are purchased on the outside for resale 
additionally margins for food safety products have continued to benefit from increased fixed asset coverage as revenue increases have outpaced increased expenditures for fixed costs

as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense remained at of revenues 
management plans to continue to expand the company s sales and marketing efforts in the future  but does not expect related expenses to increase as a percentage of sales 
the increase in general and administrative expense in was the result of additional expenses such as accounting and overall supervision necessary to service the company s higher levels of operations 
as a percentage of revenues general and administrative expense decreased to from in these costs are much more fixed in nature than many other company costs 
the increase in this category in as compared to fiscal was in part related to a credit related to the settlement of litigation which was included in this category in the year and to the costs related to the company s revenue growth of nearly in management believes that research and development is critical to the company s future and expects to continue to incur expenses at approximately the current percentage of revenue 
certain of the company s products such as those of acumedia  amvet  triple crown and squire require relatively less research and development expenditures 
management expects that research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues from sales of other products such as food safety test kits  drug detection and certain veterinary instruments and needles  will be between and annually 
during fiscal  the company s operating income increased by approximately  to of revenues following an increase of  to of revenues in these increases came principally from increases in sales of existing and newly acquired products while not incurring comparable increases in rates of expenditures for support of those sales 
other income dollars in thousands decrease decrease other income litigation settlement  interest and other total  other income decreased in principally from the effect of the decrease in interest earning assets which were used for the gene trak acquisition and from lower rates of interest 
other income decreased in principally due to the absence of the effect of the litigation settlement that was a significant factor in the increase of this category in additionally  was affected because the company had less interest earning assets following the cash purchases of amvet and squire and lower rates of interest in the second half of taxes on income dollars in thousands increase increase taxes on income    federal and state taxes on income increased in each of the years as a result of greater levels of income before taxes on income

upon completion  the total investment in this facility is expected to be approximately million 
goodwill increases result from the goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of qa life sciences and gene trak in july and august  respectively 
the increase in current liabilities is due to the normal variation of the timing of payments at year end

inflation and changing prices have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s operations 
neogen has been profitable from operations for its last quarters and has generated positive cash flow from operations during the period 
management believes  however  that the company s cash and marketable securities may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional technology and products that fit within the company s mission statement 
accordingly  the company may be required to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of the company s future capital needs
