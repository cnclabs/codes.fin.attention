critical accounting policies in the course of preparing the financial statements  management makes certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in the circumstances and the application of those policies 
the following policies are those deemed to be most critical 
inventory valuation policy inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory method 
cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is not present or for which an allocation of shared costs is required 
in addition  the company includes the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores in its costs 
the company regularly evaluates its compliance with the lower of cost or market principle 
items are evaluated by sku stock keeping unit and to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price  provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item 
additionally  the company reviews the aging of its inventory by sku 
the carrying cost of the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category 
since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both estimation and judgment of cost and market value  differences in these estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded asset 
each month  the company records an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the cost of lost or stolen inventory 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at least annually to reflect current circumstances 
inventory is physically counted at all locations at least once each year  at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements 
physical counts were taken at all stores and the distribution centers during january impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
this review includes the evaluation of individual under performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store 
future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life considering such factors as future sales levels  gross margins  changes in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  a charge is recorded to write down the cost of the assets 
since the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates  differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results 
during fiscal  the company will adopt the provisions of statement of accounting standards no  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
fas modifies previous guidance on the impairment of long lived assets 
among other provisions  it permits the use of a probability weighted estimation approach in evaluating future cash flows for a group of assets 
the impact of the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
deferred taxes the company currently has recorded million of deferred tax assets representing the difference between the timing of deductions taken for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes 
underlying the assumption that the benefit of those assets will be recoverable in some future period is the concept that the company will have future taxable income 
if future conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized  a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the assets to their estimated realizable value 
insurance the company is self insured with respect to medical and dental insurance coverage offered to its eligible employees  up to a maximum of  per claim 
above that amount  medical insurance coverage is in place 
in connection with the self insured portion  the company maintains a liability for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company s insurance carrier 
the amount of the liability is estimated based upon historical claims experience and upon information provided by the company s independent benefits broker regarding other similar insurance programs 
at february   the balance of the medical and dental liability was million 
beginning in fiscal  the company also maintains workers compensation insurance coverage with a deductible of  per claim 
at february   the company has a liability of  representing the estimated amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims under the insurance policy 
the amount of the liability reflects expected remaining workers compensation claims based upon historical claims experience and other information obtained by the company  including projections made by the underwriters of the company s insurance carrier 
as these claims are paid  the liability will be reduced 
furthermore  the liability will be adjusted if circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate that the future payments would be different than what was previously estimated 
prior to fiscal  the company s workers compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible 
since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various estimates  actual future requirements could vary from the recorded liabilities
