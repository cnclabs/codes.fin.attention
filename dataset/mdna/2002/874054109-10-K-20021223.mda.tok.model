item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of prepaid royalties  capitalized software development costs and other intangibles  inventories  realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns  price protection and doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenues are derived from publishing and distribution operations 
publishing revenues are derived from the sale of internally developed software titles or software titles licensed from third parties 
distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third party software titles  hardware and accessories 
publishing activities generally generate significantly higher margins than distribution activities  with sales of pc software titles resulting in higher margins than sales of cds or cartridges designed for video game consoles 
effective november   in accordance with the adoption of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and price protection when title and risk of loss pass to customers generally  upon receipt of products by customers 
prior to that date  we recognized revenue upon shipment 
in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the price is fixed and determinable  upon persuasive evidence of an agreement  our fulfillment of our obligations under any such agreement and a determination that collection is probable 
our payment arrangements with customers provide primarily day terms and to a limited extent with certain customers or day terms 
we may not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and allowances for certain customers or may be unable to determine that collection of receivables is probable 
in such circumstances  we defer revenue at the time of sale and recognize revenue when collection of the related receivable becomes probable or cash is collected 
returns and reserves we generally accept returns and grant price protection in connection with our publishing arrangements 
we establish a reserve for future returns of published titles and price protection based primarily on historical return rates  return policies and price protection policies  and recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and price protection 
our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders 
however  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers  which includes price discounts  credits and returns  when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 
the historical product return rate for our distribution business has been substantially less than for our publishing business 
if future returns significantly exceed established reserves  our operating results would be adversely affected 
prepaid royalties our agreements with licensors and developers generally provide us with exclusive publishing rights and require us to make advance royalty payments that are recouped against royalties due to the licensor or developer based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are amortized as cost of sales on a title by title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for that title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of prepaid royalties and charge to cost of sales the amount that management determines is probable that will not be recouped at the contractual royalty rate in the period in which such determination is made or if we determine that we will cancel a development project 
prepaid royalties are classified as current and non current assets based upon estimated net product sales within the next year 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize internal software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title 
capitalized software development costs represent the costs associated with the internal development of our publishing products 
amortization of such costs as a component of cost of sales is recorded on a title by title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for the title or the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs and will charge to cost of sales any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable or for projects that we will abandon 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income tax assets and liabilities are determined by taxable jurisdiction 
we do not provide taxes on undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries 
the total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for income tax purposes was approximately  and  for the years ended october  and  respectively 
it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance 
accordingly  no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or united states income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends to us 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf  and this eitf presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
we have early adopted eitf effective november  the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated condensed financial statements

effective november   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas in its entirety and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination shall be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas also addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets 
this statement provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill not be amortized  but be tested at least annually for impairment 
upon completion of the transitional impairment test  the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the reporting unit s carry amount and no impairment was indicated 
sfas requires an annual test for impairment of goodwill  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  the company determines the implied fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis and compares such values to the respective reporting unit s carrying amount 
the company performs its annual test for indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at october   the fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts and no impairment was indicated

forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions including  but not limited to  the following which could cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from results  performance or achievements  expressed or implied by such forward looking statements the market for interactive entertainment software titles is characterized by short product life cycles 
the interactive entertainment software market is characterized by short product life cycles and frequent introduction of new products 
new products introduced by us may not achieve significant market acceptance or achieve sufficient sales to permit us to recover development  manufacturing and associated costs 
historically  few interactive entertainment software products have achieved sustained market acceptance 
even the most successful titles remain popular for only limited periods of time  often less than six months 
the life cycle of a game generally consists of a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a decline in sales 
because revenues associated with the initial shipments of a new product generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product  any delay in the introduction of one or more new products could harm our operating results 
additionally  because we introduce a relatively limited number of new products in a given period  the failure of one or more of our products to achieve market acceptance could result in losses 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of titles 
our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended october   with grand theft auto for the playstation accounting for of our revenues  grand theft auto vice city for playstation accounting for of our revenues and max payne for the playstation accounting for of our revenues 
our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended october  for this period  grand theft auto for the playstation accounted for of our revenues  midnight club for the playstation accounted for of our revenues  smuggler s run for the playstation accounted for of our revenues  and max payne for the pc accounted for of our revenues  with each of the next three titles accounting for between and of our revenues 
our ten best selling titles accounted for of our revenues for the year ended october  each of grand theft auto  midnight club and the smuggler s run titles accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended october   with each of the next four titles accounting for between and of our revenues 
our future titles may not be commercially viable 
if we fail to continue to develop and sell new  commercially successful titles  our revenues and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal  with sales typically higher during the fourth and first calendar quarters  due primarily to the increased demand for games during and immediately following the holiday buying season 
our failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand will harm our business and operating results 
these fluctuations could also cause our stock price to decline 
other factors that cause fluctuations include delays in the introduction of new titles  the size and timing of product and corporate acquisitions  variations in sales of titles designed to operate on particular platforms  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles  sequels or enhancements of existing titles  availability of hardware platforms  the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors  product returns  the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand  and the timing of orders from major customers 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales and therefore our operating results would be harmed by a decrease in sales or a failure to meet our sales expectations 
the uncertainties associated with interactive entertainment software development  lengthy manufacturing lead times  production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 
in future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
the interactive entertainment software industry is cyclical  and we may fail to anticipate changing consumer preferences 
our business is subject to all of the risks generally associated with the interactive entertainment software industry  which has been cyclical in nature and has been characterized by periods of significant growth followed by rapid declines 
our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the popularity  price and timing of new software and hardware platforms being released and distributed by us and our competitors  international  national and regional economic conditions  particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending  changes in consumer demographics  the availability of other forms of entertainment  and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences  all of which change rapidly and cannot be predicted 
in order to plan for acquisition and promotional activities we must anticipate and respond to rapid changes in consumer tastes and preferences 
a decline in the popularity of interactive entertainment software or particular platforms could cause sales of our titles to decline dramatically 
the period of time necessary to develop new game titles  obtain approvals of manufacturers and produce cd roms or game cartridges is unpredictable 
during this period  consumer appeal of a particular title may decrease  causing sales to decline 
rapidly changing technology and platform shifts could hurt our operating results 
the interactive entertainment industry in general is associated with rapidly changing technology  which often leads to software and platform obsolescence and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
the introduction of new platforms and technologies can render existing software titles obsolete or unmarketable 
as more advanced platforms achieve market acceptance  consumer demand for software for older platforms declines 
obsolescence of software or platforms could leave us with increased inventories of unsold titles and limited amounts of new titles to sell to consumers  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are devoting development resources primarily on products designed for sony s playstation and microsoft s xbox 
if consumer demand for these platforms declines as a result of the next hardware transition cycle  we may experience lower than expected sales or losses from products designed for these platforms 
a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed or are currently developing software for use by consumers over the internet 
future increases in the availability of such software or technological advances in such software or the internet could result in a decline in platform based software and impact our sales 
direct sales of software by major manufacturers over the internet would materially adversely affect our distribution business 
our business is dependent on licensing and publishing arrangements with third parties 
our success depends on our ability to identify and develop new titles on a timely basis 
we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software 
these agreements typically require us to make advance payments  pay royalties and satisfy other conditions 
our advance payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully 
in addition  software development costs  promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers have increased significantly in recent years and reduce the potential profits derived from sales of our software 
future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers  and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments 
if we fail to satisfy our obligations under these license agreements  the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that may be burdensome to us 
returns of our published titles and markdown allowances may adversely affect our operating results 
we are exposed to the risk of product returns and markdown allowances with respect to our customers 
our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders  however  at our discretion  we may accept product returns for stock balancing or defective products 
in addition  we sometimes negotiate accommodations to customers  including price discounts  credits and product returns  when demand for specific products falls below expectations 
we generally accept returns and grant price protection in connection with our publishing arrangements 
we establish a reserve for future returns and markdown allowances for published titles based primarily on these return policies and historical return rates  and we report our revenues net of returns 
if return rates and markdown allowances for our published titles significantly exceed our reserves  our revenues will decline and we could incur losses 
the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 
we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony  microsoft and nintendo  each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms 
each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns  particularly for prime time television spots 
these companies may also increase their own software development efforts or focus on developing software products for third party platforms 
we also compete with domestic and international companies  large software companies and media companies 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  personnel and other resources than we do  and are able to carry larger inventories  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties than we can 
our titles  also compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures  television and audio and video products featuring similar themes  online computer programs and forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 
our distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment 
the intense competition that characterizes our industry is based primarily on breadth  availability and quality of product lines  price  terms and conditions of sale  credit terms and availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs 
our competitors include regional  national and international distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers and software publishers 
we may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the actions of our competitors  and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins 
increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 
retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources  and competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 
competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase  which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures just to maintain current levels of sales of our titles 
competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles frequently have greater bargaining power with retailers 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve the levels of promotional support and shelf space that such competitors receive 
rating systems for interactive entertainment software  potential legislation and consumer opposition could inhibit sales of our products 
trade organizations within the video game industry require interactive entertainment software publishers to provide consumers with information relating to graphic violence  profanity or sexually explicit material contained in software titles 
certain countries have also established similar rating systems as prerequisites for sales of interactive entertainment software in such countries 
in some instances  we may be required to modify our products to comply with the requirements of such governmental entities  which could delay the release of those products in such countries 
we believe that we comply with such rating systems and properly display the ratings received for our titles 
historically  our software titles received a rating of e age and older or t age and over  although many of our new titles including grand theft auto  grand theft auto vice city  max payne and state of emergency have received a rating of m age and over 
certain retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material  which may limit the potential market for our m rated products 
several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate the interactive entertainment software  motion picture and recording industries  including a proposal to adopt a common rating system for interactive entertainment software  television and music containing violence and sexually explicit material  and the federal trade commission has adopted rules with respect to the marketing of such material to minors 
consumer advocacy groups have also opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence and sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns 
if any groups were to target our m rated titles  we might be required to significantly change or discontinue a particular title which in the case of our best selling titles could hurt our business 
we cannot publish our console titles without the approval of hardware manufacturers 
we are required to obtain a license to develop and publish titles for each hardware platform for which we develop and publish titles 
our existing hardware console platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title by title basis 
as a result  the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms  along with our ability to time the release of these titles and  accordingly  our revenues from titles for these hardware platforms  may be limited 
if any manufacturer chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term  or if the manufacturer were to terminate our license for any reason  we would be unable to publish additional titles for that manufacturer s hardware platform 
license agreements relating to these rights generally extend for a term of three years 
the agreements are terminable upon the occurrence of a number of factors  including breach of the agreement by us  our bankruptcy or insolvency  or our entry into a relationship with  or acquisition by  a competitor of the manufacturer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new or maintain existing licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
we are dependent upon a license agreement with sony to publish titles for playstation the term of the license agreement expires in march and is automatically extended  unless terminated by one of the parties  for additional successive one year terms 
termination of such agreement would seriously hurt our business 
sony and nintendo are the sole manufacturers of the titles we publish under license from them 
games for the xbox must be manufactured by pre approved manufacturers 
each platform license provides that the manufacturer may raise prices for the titles at any time and grants the manufacturer substantial control over the release of new titles 
each of these manufacturers also publishes software for its own platforms and manufactures titles for all of its other licensees and may choose to give priority to its own titles or those of other publishers if it has insufficient manufacturing capacity or if there is increased demand 
in addition  these manufacturers may not have sufficient production capacity to satisfy our scheduling requirements during any period of sustained demand 
if manufacturers do not supply us with finished titles on favorable terms without delays  our operations would be materially interrupted  and we would be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of our product to sell to our customers 
if we cannot obtain sufficient product amounts  our revenues will decline and we could incur losses 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights or avoid claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties 
we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright  trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and distribution 
interactive entertainment software is susceptible to unauthorized copying 
unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary 
as the amount of interactive entertainment software titles in the market increases and the functionality of this software further overlaps  we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights or patents of others 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights 
although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others  it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others has or may occur 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming  costly and difficult to defend 
intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products  obtain a license or redesign our products  which could result in additional costs and delays 
we are dependent on third party software developers to complete certain of our titles 
we rely on third party software developers for the development of certain of our titles 
quality third party developers are continually in high demand 
software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future 
due to the limited number of third party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them  these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards  if at all 
we depend on third party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections 
in addition  the development cycle for new titles is long  typically ranging from twelve to twenty four months 
after development of a product  it may take between six to twelve additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms 
if developers experience financial difficulties  additional costs or unanticipated development delays  we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule 
our software is susceptible to errors  which can harm our financial results and reputation 
the technological advancements of new hardware platforms allow more complex software products 
as software products become more complex  the risk of undetected errors in products when first introduced increases 
if  despite testing  errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made  we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance  product returns  loss of revenues and damage to our reputation 
gross margins relating to our distribution business have been historically narrow which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating results 
as a result of intense price competition in the console hardware and software distribution industry  our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and we expect them to continue to be narrow in the future 
we receive purchase discounts from suppliers based on various factors  including volume purchases 
these purchase discounts directly affect our gross margins 
it may become more difficult for us to achieve the percentage growth in sales required to continue to receive volume purchase discounts 
we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 
a significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel and facilities 
in the event of a significant decline in revenues  we may not be able to exit facilities  reduce personnel  or make other significant changes to our cost structure without significant disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs 
management may not be able to implement such actions  if at all  in a timely manner to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and gross profit 
our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis 
our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
in most cases  we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers 
in certain product categories  limited price protection or return rights offered by manufacturers may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to purchase 
the console hardware industry experiences significant product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term hardware inventory shortages 
in addition  manufacturers who currently distribute their products through us may decide to distribute  or to substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  or directly to retailers we are subject to the risk that our inventory values may decline and protective terms under supplier arrangements may not adequately cover the decline in values 
the interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced generations of products  and evolving industry standards 
these changes may cause inventory to decline substantially in value or to become obsolete 
we are also exposed to inventory risk to the extent that supplier price protections are not available on all products or quantities and are subject to time restrictions 
in addition  suppliers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill price protection obligations 
a limited number of customers may account for a significant portion of our sales 
sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended october   of our revenues for the year ended october   and of our revenues for the year ended october  our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long term agreements or other commitments 
our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time 
the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers could harm our operating results 
bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could also hurt our business 
we are subject to credit and collection risks 
our sales are typically made on credit  with terms that vary depending upon the customer and the demand for the particular title being sold 
we do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our customers 
as a result  we are subject to credit risks  particularly in the event that any of our receivables represent sales to a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets 
if we are unable to collect on accounts receivable as they become due and such accounts are not covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade 
sales in international markets  primarily in the united kingdom and other countries in europe and the pacific rim  have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
sales in international markets accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended october   of our revenues for the year ended october  and of our revenues for the year ended october  we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade  including increased credit risks  tariffs and duties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays  and international political  regulatory and economic developments  all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results 
all of our international sales are made in local currencies 
we depend on skilled personnel 
our success depends on our ability to identify  hire and retain qualified management  creative  development  financial  marketing  sales and technical personnel 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel  our business and prospects would be negatively affected 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors and various factors affecting the interactive entertainment software industry may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations and possible impairment of the carrying values of our investments 
historically  fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results 
at october   we had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness 
we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant fiscal quarter or year end 
translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
for the year ended october   our foreign currency translation adjustment gain was  foreign exchange transaction gain for the year ended october  was a hypothetical change in applicable currency exchange rates at october  would result in a material translation adjustment 
in addition  we may be exposed to risk of loss associated with fluctuations in the value of our investments 
our investments are stated at fair value  with net unrealized appreciation and loss included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we regularly review the carrying values of our investments to identify and record impairment losses when events or circumstances indicate that such investments may be permanently impaired 
at october   we held  shares of common stock of gameplay 
com plc with a fair value of approximately and that is classified as a non current asset 
we recorded an unrealized loss of  net of taxes of as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
for the year ended october   we recorded a loss of  to reflect the other than temporary impairment of our investments relating to gameplay
