item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general netbank  inc is a bank holding company that wholly owns the outstanding stock of netbank  fsb  its wholly owned subsidiary  market street mortgage corporation market street  and nb partners  inc nb partners and its wholly owned subsidiary netbank partners  llp netbank partners  jointly  netbank 
netbank  fsb is a federal savings bank  and its subsidiary  market street  is a mortgage company that was acquired on june  nb partners and netbank partners are both involved in strategic partnering opportunities 
as of december   netbank had  accounts and billion in deposits 
on may   we effected a three for one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend paid to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  all references to share and per share amounts reflect the split 
financial condition at the beginning of  netbank s stated goal was to place renewed emphasis on the profitability of operations 
by the end of  income before extraordinary gain had increased from a million loss  or per share  in to million or per share income in total assets were billion as of december  as compared with billion as of december  the growth in the balance sheet was fueled by internal growth of our deposit accounts as well as through two acquisitions during the year ended december  total deposits increased from million as of december  to billion as of december  approximately million of the million increase in deposits resulted from our acquisition of  accounts from compubank on march  the remaining portion of the increase was the result of internal growth 
in addition  as part of our income diversification strategy  on june   we purchased market street  a retail mortgage lender based in clearwater  florida  and licensed to conduct business in states 
since the acquisition  market street has originated approximately billion of residential mortgages 
as of december   million of those mortgages were recorded as loans held for sale and a million liability was recorded related to loans in process 
other borrowed funds increased million  from million at december  to billion at december  the increase was the result of million outstanding under market street s million warehouse line with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and million in conventional fhlb advances extended to netbank  offset by the repayment of million in netbank fhlb advances 
as market street primarily originates fixed first mortgages  netbank purchased million in adjustable first and fixed second residential mortgages  commercial mortgages  home equity lines and leases during the year ended december  the purchases were offset by prepayments due to increased refinancing activity in a declining rate environment  resulting in a net increase of million in netbank s loan portfolio to billion at december  the securities portfolio increased million from million at december  to million at december  as netbank began to increase liquidity in anticipation of acquiring resource bancshares mortgage group  inc rbmg during the first quarter of rbmg is a wholesale mortgage banking company headquartered in columbia  south carolina focused on the purchase  sales and servicing of residential  single family mortgage loans through a nationwide network of independent brokers and correspondent banks 
the acquisition is motivated primarily by balance sheet synergies between the two companies 
netbank will gain access to higher yield assets and additional fee based income  while rbmg will enjoy a lower cost of funding 
capital resources remained fairly constant at december  at million  compared with million at december  we issued  new shares in conjunction with the acquisition of market street and repurchased approximately  shares under a stock repurchase program begun during as of december   the total number of shares held in treasury was  at an aggregate cost of  or per share

results of operations on june   netbank acquired market street in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  market street s results of operations are included from the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies netbank s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes the quality and reasonableness of its most critical policies enable the fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  netbank has identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
netbank s most critical accounting policies are those related to allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
as the majority of netbank s portfolio is purchased  an estimate of the loss inherent in the purchased portfolio is made and an allowance for loan losses is recorded by adjusting the premium associated with the purchased loans at the time of purchase 
management determines the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual and pools of loans  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans  the seller s reserve  and other pertinent factors 
any deterioration in a loan pool occurring after the date of purchase is charged to the provision for loan loss 
loans deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
provisions for loan losses  net of recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
gains on sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights gains or losses resulting from loan sales are generally recognized based on the difference between the net sale proceeds and the net book value of the loans sold 
deferred fees and costs are recorded as an adjustment of the book value and are included in the gain or loss on sale when the mortgage loan is sold 
gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are affected by the sale of  or the recording of retained mortgage servicing rights related to the specific pools of loans sold 
premium on loans purchased premiums on loans purchased from third parties are capitalized and amortized over the average life of the loan as an adjustment to yield 
such premiums are classified with the loan balance to which they relate for financial reporting purposes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general 
at the beginning of  netbank s stated goal was to place renewed emphasis on the profitability of operations 
by the end of  income before extraordinary gain had increased from a million loss  or per share  in to million or per share income in the increase in overall income before extraordinary gain was driven by a company wide focus on serving our existing customer base more efficiently  providing enhancements to products where the initial investment had already been made and cross selling products to turn less profitable customers into more profitable ones 
during the year ended december   we substantially reduced our marketing and infrastructure expenditures by continuing our focus on pay for performance type arrangements  introducing certain fees intended to encourage our existing customers to take advantage of less costly  on line services and customer self service tools on our web site 
in addition  we examined our relationship with each of our major vendors and asked those vendors to work with us to identify ways to cut costs 
we also diversified and enhanced our income stream through the acquisition of market street 
this acquisition allowed us to generate fee income related to the origination and sale of first mortgages  to reduce the risk of material write downs of premiums related to prepayment activity during periods of declining rates  and to participate in the increased refinancing activity during a period of declining rates 
interest income 
interest income related to our loan and investment portfolio for the year ended december  increased million  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of a higher average balance in both the securities and the loan portfolios due to account growth during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   offset by lower yields on both portfolios as interest rates declined and both loans and securities repriced during the year 
the average balance in the loan and securities portfolio was billion and million  respectively during the year ended december   as compared with billion and million during the year ended december  loan yields were for both the years ended december  and the yield on the investment portfolio was for the year ended december  as compared with for the year ended december  the mix of the loan portfolio remained relatively stable  with of our loan portfolio invested in first mortgages at both december  and interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was the million  or  increase in our deposit portfolio and a million  or  increase in other borrowed funds  primarily fhlb advances and the market street warehouse line 
this increase in volume was offset by constant decreases in interest rates throughout the year ended december   with the average rate paid on deposits decreasing from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  and the average rate paid on other borrowed funds decreasing from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  and is effected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to million  or of interest earning assets for the year ended december  net interest margin remained constant due to loan and securities yields decreasing due to the declining rate environment and deposits re pricing at approximately the same rate  thereby keeping the net interest spread constant 
provision for loan losses 
in connection with the purchase of loan portfolios  we assess the inherent loss in the portfolios at the date of purchase and record the necessary allowance by adjusting the premium associated with each portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual and pools of loans  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans  the seller s reserve  and other pertinent factors 
any deterioration in a loan pool occurring after the date of purchase is charged to the provision for loan loss 
during the year ended december   we recorded million as an addition to premiums related to allowance for loan losses for loans purchased during the year 
in addition  we also recorded a provision for loan losses of million primarily related to two portfolios of fixed second mortgages with high loan to value ratios and one pool of auto loans 
this compares to a provision of million recorded during the year ended december  primarily related to these same pools 
we periodically review the performance of our loan portfolio by reviewing chargeoffs  delinquency statistics  and industry statistics on a pool by pool basis for our purchased portfolio and a loan by loan basis for our originated loans 
if a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or a loan is noted  we record an additional allowance through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual and pools of loans  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and other pertinent factors 
non interest income 
for the year ended december   non interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of million in gains on sales of loans and loan servicing recorded during the year ended december  related to market street  a million increase in gains on sales of securities  and a million increase in fee income due to an increase in service charges resulting from the million increase in our deposit portfolio as well as new fee initiatives introduced during the fourth quarter of and the first six months of the initiatives included introduction of new fees that encouraged our existing customers to take advantage of our on line services such as on line bill payment  rather than more costly  labor intensive services such as writing checks 
non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all operating expenses including salaries and benefits  marketing  general and administrative expenses excluding interest expense  provision for loan losses and income taxes 
non interest expense increased million  or for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  approximately of this increase resulted from the recording of million in non interest expense related to market street subsequent to acquisition on june  the remaining million of the increase in non interest expense resulted from increases in salaries and benefits million  customer service million  data processing million  depreciation and amortization million  and loan servicing million  offset by a reduction in marketing expense million 
salaries and benefits increased as netbank s employee base grew from full time equivalents at december  to full time equivalents at december  an expansion necessary to support the increase in customer accounts from  accounts at december  to  accounts at december  customer service expense increased due to variable customer service expenses such as call center support which increased as the number of accounts increased during the year ended december  in addition  we experienced a million increase in cash item losses as compared with the year ended december  due to the increased number of accounts and depositors as well as uncollectible or fraudulent deposits associated with the compubank conversion 
data processing primarily increased due to variable charges tied to the number of deposit accounts 
depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with the core deposit intangible recorded as part of the acquisition of compubank accounts during the first quarter of  as well as increased amortization due to higher capitalized software balances recorded during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  loan servicing increased due to the increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  marketing expenses returned to a more normalized level as compared with december  when marketing expenditures were targeted at a higher level due to gains realized on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general 
during the first quarter of  we identified an opportunity to repurchase  at a substantial discount  some of our million in convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
we realized that the gains from this repurchase of the convertible notes would allow us to accelerate our marketing and infrastructure programs to attract a greater number of customers during this growth phase of our business model 
therefore  during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated notes outstanding for million in cash and  shares of netbank common stock and recorded an extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt of million  net of tax 
these gains are the primary reason for the million increase in net income for the year ended december  over the year ended december  because of these substantial gains  we were able to invest million in marketing expenses to attract customers  a increase over last year s marketing expenditures of million 
this increase in marketing expenditures allowed us to attract approximately  new accounts  which generated a million increase in customer deposits 
due to the increase in new accounts during december   we made additional investments in infrastructure and new product development to support those customers and maintain our current customer attrition rate of less than annually 
due to the extraordinary gains realized from the repurchase of debt  management increased marketing expenditures as well as infrastructure and product development investments  the primary reason for the decrease in operating income of million  or over the year ended december  interest income 
interest income related to our loan and investment portfolio for the year ended december  increased million  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of the increase in our loan portfolio from million at december  to billion at december   as well as better yields on our security portfolio  offset by slightly lower loan yields due to a larger percentage of first mortgages in our loan portfolio 
first mortgages typically produce comparatively lower yields than second mortgages  home equity lines  or commercial mortgages 
loan yields were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the yield on the investment portfolio was for the year ended december  as compared with for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase was the million  or  increase in our deposit portfolio and a million  or  increase in other borrowed funds  primarily fhlb advances 
the increase in interest expense was further the result of higher interest rates  with the average rate paid on deposits increasing from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  and the average rate paid on other borrowed funds increasing from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  and is effected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to million  or of interest earning assets for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income  or spread  was primarily the result of higher interest rates paid on customer deposits due to increased competition for retail deposits  as well as higher interest rates paid on other borrowed funds due to an inverted yield curve 
the inverted yield curve that existed throughout most of the year ended december   also negatively effected the yields on investment securities and loans 
provision for loan losses 
in connection with the purchase of loan portfolios  we assess the inherent loss in the portfolios and record the necessary allowance by adjusting the premium associated with each portfolio 
during the year ended december   we recorded million as an addition to premiums related to allowance for loan losses for loans purchased during the year 
in addition  we also recorded a provision for loan losses of million primarily related to originated loans and two portfolios of fixed second mortgages with high loan to value ratios 
this compares to a provision of million recorded during the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the increase in volume of our originated portfolio 
we periodically review the performance of our loan portfolio by reviewing chargeoffs  delinquency statistics  and industry statistics on a pool by pool basis for our purchased portfolio and a loan by loan basis for our originated loans 
if a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or a loan is noted  we record an additional allowance through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual and pools of loans  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and other pertinent factors 
non interest income 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in non interest income compared to million recorded during the year ended december  gains on sales of securities  which are included in this category were million during the year ended december   as compared with million for the year ended december  the remaining portion of the increase was due to an increase in service charges resulting from the million increase in our deposit portfolio as well as a new fee initiative introduced during the fourth quarter of the initiative included introduction of new fees that encouraged our existing customers to take advantage of our on line services such as on line bill payment  rather than more costly  labor intensive services such as writing checks 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses include all operating expenses including salaries and benefits  marketing  general and administrative expenses excluding interest expense  provision for loan losses and income taxes 
non interest expense increased million  or for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of planned increases in marketing and infrastructure as a result of the gains realized on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes 
these increases primarily fell into three categories marketing  which increased million  customer services which increased million  and data processing which increased million 
in addition  customer service was also impacted by a million non recurring charge during the fourth quarter of that resulted from a detailed review of all customer accounts including customer credit scoring procedures  hold policies  and overdraft policies which may be impacted by the impending economic slowdown 
consequently  we have closed certain accounts due to these tighter controls  written off customer debit balances greater than days old  and we have established what we believe is a required cash item loss reserve on our balance sheet 
customer service was also impacted by increasing incremental expenses such as postage  telephone and loan servicing fees commiserate with the increase in new accounts 
in addition  salaries and benefits increased million as a result of additional headcount as we continued to add employees to support the rapid growth of netbank s activities and customer base 
interest rate sensitivity we measure interest rate sensitivity as the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature  reprice  or repay within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would be in a better position than an institution with a negative gap to invest in higher yielding assets or have its asset yields adjusted upward 
this would result in the yield on its assets increasing at a faster pace than the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
during a period of falling interest rates  however  an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets adjusted downward at a faster rate than one with a negative gap 
this would tend to reduce or restrain the growth of its net interest income

since inception  the major component of our asset gathering strategy has always been to purchase high quality loans from other originating institutions 
with the purchase of market street during the year ended december   we modified this strategy to include the origination of high quality loans 
the origination capability allows us to participate in the fee income stream related to origination and reduces the risk of material write downs of premium related to prepayment activity during periods of declining rates 
however  as market street primarily originates fixed first mortgages  we continue to purchase other types of loans through bulk loan purchases 
both our loan acquisition and origination strategy continue to focus on single family residential mortgages  with some diversification during the year as we continue to slow our asset growth 
during the year  million  or of our purchases were first and second residential mortgages  bringing the total percentage of our loan portfolio secured by single family residential mortgages to as of december  at december    and  our loans receivable portfolio  including loans held for sale  totaled billion  billion  and million  or   and of total assets  respectively

allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
as the majority of our portfolio is purchased  we make an estimate of the loss inherent in the purchased portfolio at the date of purchase based on industry statistics and a review of the seller s reserve and record an allowance for loan losses by adjusting the premium associated with the purchased loans 
we periodically review the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual loans and loan pools  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various pools of loans  or individual loans  industry statistics and other pertinent factors 
if we note a decline in credit quality for a specific loan pool or a loan  we record an additional allowance through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
loans that we deem uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
we also add provisions for loan losses  net of recoveries on loans previously charged off  to the allowance 
although we use the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provisions for loan losses  additional provisions for loan losses may be necessary in the future should economic or other conditions change substantially 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the agency may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about the information available to them at the time of their examination

forward look the year ended december  was an exciting one for netbank 
we acquired and converted approximately  accounts from compubank and acquired all of the outstanding stock of market street  while managing substantial internal growth as well 
during the course of the year  our management never lost sight of our established goal increasing the core profitability of netbank 
while we were successful in achieving this goal income before extraordinary gain increased from a million loss  or per share  in to million or per share income in  we plan to continue to increase profitability during netbank is currently in the process of acquiring resource bancshares mortgage group  inc  a wholesale mortgage banking company focused on the purchase  sales and servicing of residential  single family first mortgage loans through a nationwide network of mortgage brokers and correspondent banks 
the shareholders of netbank and rbmg approved the transaction on february   subject to regulatory approval  and it is expected to close during the first quarter of the acquisition is motivated primarily by balance sheet synergies between the two companies 
netbank will gain access to higher yield assets and additional fee based income  while rbmg will enjoy a lower cost of funding both factors which equate to higher profitability 
as such  during we plan to focus on fully integrating both market street and rbmg s loan products into our on line offerings 
the goal is to make customers netbank deposit accounts the cornerstone of managing all of their personal financial services through netbank their mortgages  investments  credit card account  and insurance policies 
some of the products we have already developed  such as account consolidation  and the marketing structure that we have developed to cross sell other netbank products will facilitate the integration of both market street and rbmg s existing products  as well as new lending products we plan to introduce in the future 
in addition  we will continue to develop additional products and service enhancements designed to help us gain customers  add additional financial services for our customers  and continue to drive down account acquisition costs 
additional products may be added through either internal development or through acquisition 
service enhancements may be internally developed or acquired via marketing alliances 
as such  we will continue to target product and marketing alliances with other internet financial services providers as well as off line service providers and selectively review acquisition opportunities 
while we still intend to grow at rates higher than traditional thrifts  we plan to continue to temper our growth by continuing to carefully target our marketing initiatives and focusing on increasing the profitability of existing customers  rather than broad market advertising campaigns 
lastly  we plan to continue to focus on serving our customers with quality  efficient customer service through system enhancements and self service tools available through our web site

it is important to note that netbank s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the rbmg acquisition may not close

netbank may not be able to lower rbmg s cost of funding 
we may not be able to fully integrate market street and rbmg s loan products into our on line offerings

we may not be able to serve our customers as efficiently as we have in the past 
regulatory  interest rate  and other economic changes could interfere with our ability to conduct our business profitably 
in addition  you should consult the risk factors outlined in netbank s form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  for a complete discussion of risk factors inherent to our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal business is the originating and purchasing of loans funded by customer deposits and  to the extent necessary  other borrowed funds 
consequently  a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and fluctuations in interest rates  specifically the prime rate  will affect our future net interest income and cash flows 
this interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
the only derivative financial instruments that we enter into are short term forward commitments to protect against changes in the fair value of market street s commitments to fund mortgage loan applications in process the pipeline and mortgage loans held for sale the warehouse due to fluctuations in interest rates 
these forward commitments are designated as fair value hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
netbank is generally not exposed to significant losses nor does it expect to realize significant gains related to the pipeline or warehouse due to changes in interest rates  net of gains or losses on related hedge positions 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purchases 
our exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by our management 
netbank  fsb measures interest rate risk based on net portfolio value npv analysis 
npv equals the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
an npv ratio is determined by dividing npv by the present value of assets 
netbank  fsb measures interest rate risk by estimating npv ratio over a series of hypothetical interest rate scenarios or rate shocks 
the following table sets forth the estimated percentage change in netbank s  fsb npv ratio as of december  assuming rate shocks of to basis points limits and current npv ratios rate shock in basis points estimated december  npv ratios flat computation of prospective effects of hypothetical rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
