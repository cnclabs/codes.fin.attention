item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal years ended june    and revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  were  compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the components of revenues are net sales and royalties we earn on the sale of our products by others and contract revenues 
net sales increased by to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was due to increased oncaspar sales 
the increase in oncaspar sales was due to the lifting during the prior year of all of the fda distribution and labeling restrictions that were in place for a portion of fiscal during the year ended june   the fda gave final approval to manufacturing changes which we made to correct certain manufacturing problems  and all previously imposed restrictions were lifted 
net sales of adagen were  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  sales increased by to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  this was due to increased oncaspar and adagen sales 
the increase in oncaspar sales was due to the mid year lifting of fda imposed distribution and labelling restrictions which were in place during fiscal year ended june  net sales of adagen increased to  for the year ended june  as compared to  in fiscal the increase in adagen sales resulted from an increase in the number of patients receiving adagen treatment 
royalties for the year ended june  increased to  compared to  in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the commencement of sales of peg intron in combination with rebetol in the us and increased sales of peg intron in europe 
schering plough  our marketing partner for peg intron  began selling peg intron in the european union in june and in the us in february peg intron also received marketing approval for use in combination with rebetol for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c in the european union in march and in the us in august schering plough launched peg intron as combination therapy with rebetol in the us in october royalties for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended june  due to the approval of peg intron in the european union in late fiscal and in the united states during fiscal sales of adagen are expected to increase at rates comparable to those achieved during the last two years as additional patients are treated 
we anticipate oncaspar revenues to increase due to increased detailing of the product resulting from our reacquisition of marketing rights for the product from aventis at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we distributed and recorded the net sales of oncaspar  but the product was not marketed by us or aventis 
we expect royalties on peg intron to increase in future quarters with the continued roll out of the product in the us schering plough has reported that clinical trials of peg intron for additional indications are being conducted and will seek approval in additional countries for peg intron 
however  we cannot assure you that any particular sales levels of adagen  oncaspar or peg intron will be achieved or maintained 
contract revenues for the year ended june  decreased by  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was related primarily to a  milestone payment from our development partner schering plough which was earned as a result of the fda s approval of peg intron during the year ended june  contract revenues for the year ended june  increased by  as compared to the prior year as a result of a  milestone payment from schering plough in the fiscal year offset by a  milestone payment received in from schering plough for the fda s acceptance in february of the us marketing application for peg intron 
we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of  for the year ended june    for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were  for the year ended june    for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the prior year 
this increase was due to lower cost of goods sold during the previous fiscal year as certain finished goods  which had previously been reserved for due to previously disclosed manufacturing problems related to oncaspar  were cleared and sold in the prior year 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended june  was as compared to in this improvement was primarily due to the prior year s write off of oncaspar finished goods related to the previously disclosed manufacturer problems 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to the clinical advancement and related clinical trial costs for prothecan peg camptothecin and peg paclitaxel and increased payroll and related expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  in the increase was due to increased payroll and related expenses due to an increase in research personnel and increased contracted services related to clinical trials and preclinical studies for products under development  including prothecan and peg paclitaxel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by  to  as compared to  in the increase was primarily due to increased payroll and related expenditures for additional administrative personnel and costs related to the identification and review of potential strategic alliances to gain access to technologies and products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased by  to  as compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to a net charge of  recorded in the prior year  which was the result of a binding arbitration award in a lawsuit brought by a former financial advisor 
the decrease was partially offset by increased legal fees associated with patent filings and patent litigation costs 
other income expense 
interest income increased by  to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in interest bearing investments  primarily due to the issuance of  of convertible subordinated notes during june interest expense increased to  from  for the prior year due to the issuance of the  in convertible subordinated notes in june other income increased to  for the year ended june  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to a  payment from inhale in connection with the settlement of the patent infringement suit against inhale s subsidiary shearwater corporation  inc this one time payment was reimbursement for expenses we incurred in defending our branched peg patent 
other income expense increased by  to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income due to an increase in interest bearing investments 
income taxes 
for the year ended june   the company recognized a net tax benefit of approximately  primarily related to the reduction in the valuation allowance based on the company s net operating losses expected to be utilized to offset the estimated tax liability for the year ended june  we also recognized a tax provision which represents our anticipated alternative minimum tax liability based on our fiscal taxable income 
the tax provision was offset by the sale of a portion of our net operating losses to the state of new jersey 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately  of our state net operating loss carry forwards for proceeds of  for the year ended june  the company recognized a tax provision  which represents our anticipated alternative minimum tax liability based on our fiscal taxable income 
the tax provision was offset by the sale of a portion of our net operating losses to the state of new jersey 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately  of our state net operating loss carry forwards and recognized a tax benefit of  from this sale 
liquidity and capital resources total cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as of june  were  as compared to  as of june  the decrease in total cash reserves was primarily due to the strategic investment of approximately  in inhale therapeutics and micromet ag  and the payment of  for the reacquisition of oncaspar offset in part by approximately  in positive cash flow from operations 
we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government backed securities 
as of june   we had  of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
interest is payable on january and july of each year beginning january  accrued interest on the notes was approximately  as of june  which was paid on july  
the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock at any time on or before july  the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
on or after july   we may redeem any or all of the notes at specified redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the day preceding the redemption date 
the notes will mature on july  unless earlier converted  redeemed at our option or redeemed at the option of the note holder upon a fundamental change  as described in the indenture for the notes 
neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are subject to any financial covenants under the indenture 
in addition  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture from paying dividends  incurring debt or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
to date  our sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of our stock through public offerings and private placements  the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  sales of and royalties on sales of adagen  oncaspar  and peg intron  sales of our products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees and royalty advances 
the company has a capital expenditure commitment for the year ended june  of approximately million 
in january  we purchased million of newly issued inhale convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock is convertible into inhale common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in the event inhale s common stock price three years from the date of issuance of the preferred stock  or earlier in certain circumstances  is less than  the conversion price will be adjusted down  although in no event will it be less than per share 
in april  we purchased an million interest bearing note from micromet which is convertible into micromet common stock 
in june  we entered into an agreement with aventis to reacquire our rights to market and distribute oncaspar 
under this agreement we paid million to aventis 
as of june    shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into  shares of common stock 
accrued dividends on the converted series a preferred stock in the aggregate of  were settled by the issuance of  shares of common stock and cash payments of  the preferred shares outstanding at june  are convertible into approximately  shares of common stock 
dividends accrue on the remaining outstanding shares of series a preferred stock at a rate of  per year 
as of june   there were accrued and unpaid dividends totaling  on the  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding 
we have the option to pay these dividends in either cash or common stock 
our current sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of and royalties on sales of adagen  oncaspar  and peg intron  and sales of our products for research purposes and license fees 
based upon our currently planned research and development activities and related costs and our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our capital  debt service and operational requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products  to fund future operations and potential acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our operating leases 
our facilities lease expense in future years will increase over previous years as a result of a new lease agreement entered into in in march  we entered into a lease for a  square feet facility located in bridgewater  nj that will serve as our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of years  followed by one five year renewal option period 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately  throughout the five year term of the lease 
other commitments for operating leases total in april  we entered into a multi year strategic collaboration with micromet ag  a private company to combine our patent estates and complementary expertise in single chain antibody sca technology to create a leading platform of therapeutic products based on antibody fragments 
we have an obligation to fund of research and development expenses for activities relating to sca for the collaboration through september critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe based on our current business that there are no critical accounting policies  except for our accounting related to income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rated expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company has significant net deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating loss carryforward  and continues to analyze what the level of the valuation allowance is needed see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our other policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combination  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method no longer is permitted 
sfas requires that the purchase method be used for business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
the amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the statement  which was adopted by the company on july  sfas has no impact on our historical financial statements as we do not have any goodwill or intangible assets  which resulted from business combinations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
since the requirement is to recognize the obligation when incurred  approaches that have been used in the past to accrue the asset retirement obligation over the life of the asset are no longer acceptable 
sfas also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is increased at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie  accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
enterprises are required to adopt statement for fiscal years beginning after june  we are in the process of evaluating this sfas and the effect that it will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
enterprises are required to adopt sfas for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating this sfas and the effect that it will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard supercedes the accounting guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company is currently evaluating this standard 
risk factors our near term success is heavily dependent on schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron 
in the near term  our results of operations are heavily dependent on schering plough s sales of peg intron 
under our agreement with schering plough  pursuant to which we applied our peg technology to develop a modified form of schering plough s intron a  we are receiving royalties on worldwide sales of peg intron 
during the fiscal year ended june   royalties on sales of peg intron comprised approximately of our total revenues 
schering plough is responsible for conducting and funding the clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing the product worldwide on an exclusive basis 
schering plough received marketing authorization for peg intron in the united states in january and in the european union in may for the treatment of hepatitis c 
schering plough has also been granted marketing approval for the sale of peg intron and rebetol capsules as combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c in march in the european union and in august in the us if schering plough fails to effectively market peg intron or discontinues the marketing of peg intron for these indications  this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even though the use of peg intron as a stand alone therapy and as combination therapy with rebetol has received fda approval  we cannot assure you that schering plough will be successful in marketing peg intron or that schering plough will not continue to market intron a  either as a stand alone product or in combination therapy with rebetol 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by schering plough to the marketing of peg intron is not within our control 
if schering plough breaches or terminates its agreement with us  the commercialization of peg intron could be slowed or blocked completely 
our revenues will be negatively affected if schering plough continues to market intron a in competition with peg intron or if it cannot meet the manufacturing demands of the market 
schering plough has experienced problems manufacturing sufficient quantities of peg intron to meet market demand 
if schering plough breaches the agreement  a dispute may arise between us 
a dispute would be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the commercialization of peg intron  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not sustain profitability 
prior to the fiscal year ended june   we had incurred substantial losses 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we earned a profit for the fiscal years ended june  and  we cannot assure you that we will be able to remain profitable 
our ability to remain profitable will depend primarily on schering plough s effective marketing of peg intron  as well as on the rate of growth in our other product sales or royalty revenue and on the level of our expenses 
our ability to achieve long term profitability will depend upon our or our licensees ability to obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that our products will achieve market acceptance or will be commercialized successfully or that our operations will sustain profitability 
we are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with these regulations can be costly  time consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and abroad are subject to stringent governmental regulation 
the sale of any of our products for use in humans in the united states will require the prior approval of the fda 
similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
obtaining fda approval for a new therapeutic product may take several years and involve substantial expenditures 
adagen was approved by the fda in oncaspar was approved in the united states and in germany in  and in canada in  in each case for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are hypersensitive to native forms of l asparaginase 
oncaspar was approved in russia in april for therapeutic use in a broad range of cancers 
peg intron was approved in europe and the united states for the treatment of hepatitis c in may and january  respectively 
except for these approvals  none of our other products has been approved for sale and use in humans in the united states or elsewhere 
we cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain fda or other relevant marketing approval for any of our other products 
in addition  any approved products are subject to continuing regulation 
if we or our licensees fail to comply with applicable requirements it could result in o criminal penalties  o civil penalties  o fines  o recall or seizure  o injunctions requiring suspension of production  o orders requiring ongoing supervision by the fda  or o refusal by the government to approve marketing or export applications or to allow us to enter into supply contracts 
if we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested  it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products 
it could also limit the commercial use of our products 
any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced problems complying with the fda s regulations for manufacturing our products  and we may not be able to resolve these problems 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before they can be used in commercial manufacturing 
we or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we manufacture oncaspar and adagen  and schering plough is responsible for the manufacture of peg intron 
adagen and oncaspar use our earlier peg technology which tends to be less stable then the peg technology used in peg intron and our products under development 
due  in part  to the draw backs in the earlier technologies we have had and will likely continue to have these and other potential manufacturing problems with these products 
manufacturing and stability problems required us to implement voluntarily recalls for one adagen batch in march and certain batches of oncaspar in june during  we experienced manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to increased levels of white particulates in batches of oncaspar  which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
in november  as a result of manufacturing changes we implemented  the fda withdrew this distribution restriction 
during this period we agreed with the fda to temporary labeling and distribution restrictions for oncaspar and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
in july  the fda conducted an inspection of our manufacturing facility in connection with our product license for adagen 
following that inspection  the fda documented several deviations from current good manufacturing practices  known as cgmp  in a form report 
we provided the fda with a corrective action plan 
in november  the fda issued a warning letter citing the same cgmp deviations listed in the july form  but it also stated that the fda was satisfied with our proposed corrective actions 
as a result of the deviations  the fda decided not to approve product export requests from us for oncaspar until it determined that all noted cgmp deviations were either corrected or in the process of being corrected 
this restriction was removed in august since january  the fda has conducted follow up inspections as well as routine inspections of our manufacturing facility related to oncaspar and adagen 
following certain of these inspections  the fda issued form reports  citing deviations from cgmp 
we have or are in the process of responding to such reports with corrective action plans and are currently in discussion with the fda concerning some observations set forth in the form s 
we are aware that the fda has conducted inspections of certain of the manufacturing facilities of schering plough and those inspections have resulted in the issuance of form s citing deviations from cgmp 
if we or our licensees  including schering plough  face additional manufacturing problems in the future or if we or our licensees are unable to satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems  the fda could require us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products or to delay continuation of clinical trials 
if we or our licensees  including schering plough  cannot market and distribute our products for an extended period  sales of the products will suffer  which would adversely affect our financial results 
our clinical trials could take longer to complete and cost more than we expect 
we will need to conduct significant additional clinical studies of all of our product candidates  which have not yet been approved for sale 
these studies are costly  time consuming and unpredictable 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a phase iii clinical trial is being conducted for peg intron for one cancer indication 
schering plough is also in early stage clinical trials for peg intron in other cancer indications 
schering plough is currently conducting late stage strategic clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis c in japan 
clinical trials are also being conducted for peg intron as a long term maintenance therapy copilot and as combination therapy with rebetol in patients with chronic hepatitis c who did not respond to or had relapsed following previous interferon based therapy 
we are currently conducting early stage clinical trials of two other peg products  prothecan currently in phase ii and peg paclitaxel currently in phase i 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we or the other sponsors of these clinical trials are unable to accrue sufficient clinical patients in such trials during the appropriate period  such trials may be delayed and will likely incur significant additional costs 
in addition  fda or institutional review boards may require us to delay  restrict  or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the cost of human clinical trials varies dramatically based on a number of factors  including o the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  o the extent of development and financial support from corporate collaborators  o the number of patients required for enrollment  o the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of the product candidate  and o the difficulty in obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians 
all statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future  which could affect the cost of our clinical trials 
any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical studies could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we rely on corporate collaborators or academic institutions to conduct some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
we cannot assure you that these trials will commence or be completed as we expect or that they will be conducted successfully 
if preclinical and clinical trials do not yield positive results  our product candidates will fail 
if preclinical and clinical testing of one or more of our product candidates do not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the desired indications  those potential products will fail 
numerous unforeseen events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following o the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  o potential products may not have the desired effect or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved  o results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  and o after reviewing test results  we or our corporate collaborators may abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be promising 
clinical testing is very costly and can take many years 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval  which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in june  we reported that schering plough completed its phase iii clinical trial  which compared peg intron to intron a in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia or cml 
in the study  although peg intron demonstrated clinical comparability and a comparable safety profile with intron a  the efficacy results for peg intron did not meet the protocol specified statistical criteria for non inferiority  the primary endpoint of the study 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products  they may not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance of any kind 
the degree of market acceptance will depend on many factors  including o the receipt  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  o the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially competitive products  o the availability of third party reimbursement  and o the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of drug candidates  as well as their advantages over existing technologies and therapeutics 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
we depend on our collaborative partners 
if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
we rely heavily and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical companies  for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to many of our product candidates 
if we lose our collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and financial performance may suffer 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked completely 
we cannot assure you that our collaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
our collaborators could develop competing products 
in addition  our revenues will be affected by the effectiveness of our corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products 
we cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we are dependent upon a single outside supplier for each of the crucial raw materials necessary to the manufacture of each of our products and product candidates 
we cannot assure you that sufficient quantities of our raw material requirements will be available to support the continued research  development or manufacture of our products 
we purchase the unmodified compounds utilized in our approved products and products under development from outside suppliers 
we may be required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certain unmodified compounds 
we do not produce the unmodified adenosine deaminase used in the manufacture of adagen or the unmodified forms of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar 
we have a supply contract with an outside supplier for the supply of each of these unmodified compounds 
if we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any unmodified compound  including unmodified adenosine deaminase or unmodified l asparaginase  on reasonable terms  or at all  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product  the fda and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in our clinical trials 
this testing could delay or stop development of a product  limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
if we are unable to demonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound  we will likely be required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conducted for the compound 
the marketing of an fda approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted 
even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound  the fda or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material 
there is one fda approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme  or ada  used in adagen 
during we obtained fda approval of the use of the ada enzyme obtained from bovine intestines from cattle of new zealand origin 
new zealand currently certifies that it s cattle are bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease free 
beginning in september  the united states department of agriculture or usda will require all animal sourced materials shipped to the united states from any european country to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is bse free 
we currently have more than a year s supply of ada enzyme in inventory and are investigating the ability for our supplier which processes our ada enzyme supply in germany to comply with or obtain a waiver of this requirement 
we cannot guarantee that such certificate or waiver will be available 
if our supplier is unable to supply us with ada enzyme  it is likely that we will be unable to produce or distribute adagen once we utilize our current inventory of ada enzyme 
the united states and foreign patents upon which our original peg technology was based have expired 
we depend on patents and proprietary rights  which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products 
research corporation technologies  inc held the patent upon which our original peg technology was based and had granted us a license under such patent 
research corporation s patent contained broad claims covering the attachment of peg to polypeptides 
however  this united states patent and its corresponding foreign patents have expired 
based upon the expiration of the research corporation patent  other parties will be permitted to make  use or sell products covered by the claims of the research corporation patent  subject to other patents  including those which we hold 
we have obtained several patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking peg to therapeutic compounds 
we cannot assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent infringement or that competitors will not develop alternative methods of attaching peg to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents 
we are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the united states and other countries with respect to the application of peg to proteins and other compounds 
we cannot assure you that the expiration of the research corporation patent or other patents related to peg that have been granted to third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies both in the united states and in other countries 
we have been licensed  and been issued  a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and we have other patent applications pending to protect our proprietary technology 
although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition  we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us  will afford us adequate protection from competing products  or will not be challenged or declared invalid 
in addition we cannot assure you that additional united states patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us 
the scope of patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain  and our patents and patent applications are subject to this uncertainty 
to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base  we may need to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties 
if we are unable to obtain such licenses  our product development efforts may be delayed or blocked 
we are aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our peg and sca technology patents 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patent and other rights against such organizations 
we expect that there will continue to be significant litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding patents and other proprietary rights 
we have become involved in patent litigation  and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
we may incur substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in defending suits against us related to intellectual property rights 
such disputes could substantially delay our product development or commercialization activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to protect our proprietary technology 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements  and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
we have limited sales and marketing experience  which makes us dependent on our marketing partners 
prior to our reacquisition in june of marketing rights to oncaspar for the united states and certain other countries  adagen  which we market on a worldwide basis to a small patient population  was the only product for which we engaged in the direct commercial marketing and therefore we do not have significant experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
for some of our products  we have provided exclusive marketing rights to our corporate partners in return for milestone payments and royalties to be received on sales 
to the extent that we enter into licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our future products  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that such third parties devote to our products 
in addition  to the extent we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to increase the size of our internal sales force 
in any sales or marketing effort  we would compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against other such companies 
we may acquire other companies or products and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we may expand and diversify our operations with acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating any such company with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from any acquisition include those associated with o unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired company  o conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  o coordinating our new product and process development  o diversion of existing management relating to the integration and operation of the acquired company  o hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and o increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
we may need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs  and this financing may not be available when we need it 
our current development projects require substantial capital 
we may require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization of potential products 
in addition  we may seek to acquire additional products  technologies and companies  which could require substantial capital 
we do not expect to achieve significant sales or royalty revenue from adagen and oncaspar 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain significant revenue from peg intron 
additional funds from other sources may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or one or more of our proposed acquisitions of technologies or companies which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
while we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o the level of revenues we receive from our fda approved products and product candidates  o continued progress of our research and development programs  o our ability to establish additional collaborative arrangements  o changes in our existing collaborative relationships  o progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance for our products  o the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments  and o our ability to market and distribute our products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to o delay  reduce the scope or eliminate one or more of our development projects  o obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or o license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would harm our research and development programs and our business 
risks related to our industry we face rapid technological change and intense competition  which could harm our business and results of operations 
the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may result in our products and technologies becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
we know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention  diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experiences and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs  as well as obtaining fda and other regulatory approval 
if we cannot compete effectively  our business and financial performance would suffer 
we may be sued for product liability 
because our products and product candidates are new treatments with limited  if any  past use on humans  their use during testing or after approval could expose us to product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of million for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to fda approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after fda approval 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of our other products in the future 
also  this insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims  and a product liability claim may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
sales of our products could be adversely affected if the costs for these products are not reimbursed by third party payors 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the united states 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in addition  government and private third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
our ability to commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of the products and related treatments will be available from third party payors 
if we or any of our collaborators succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  we cannot assure you that third party payors will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in addition  lifetime limits on benefits included in most private health plans may force patients to self pay for treatment 
for example  patients who receive adagen are expected to require injections for their entire lives 
the cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients to self fund further treatment 
furthermore  inadequate third party coverage may lead to reduced market acceptance of our products 
significant changes in the health care system in the united states or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
risks related to our subordinated notes and common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile which may significantly affect the trading price of our notes 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range  and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors  including o the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o announcements of technical innovations or new products by us  our corporate partners or our competitors  o the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements  o regulatory approvals  o government regulation  o developments in patent or other proprietary rights  o public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  o litigation  o acts of war or terrorism in the united states or worldwide  and o general market conditions in our industry 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have especially affected the market price of the stock of many high technology and healthcare related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
nonetheless  these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our notes are subordinated 
our convertible subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes 
we are not prohibited from incurring debt  including senior indebtedness  under the indenture 
if we were to incur additional debt or liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
as of june   we had no senior indebtedness outstanding 
we may be unable to redeem our notes upon a fundamental change 
we may be unable to redeem our notes in the event of a fundamental change 
upon a fundamental change  holders of the notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes 
any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions  or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
if a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes  we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt 
if we do not obtain a consent  we could not purchase or redeem the notes 
our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in such circumstances  or if a fundamental change would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness  the subordination provisions of the indenture would restrict payments to the holders of notes 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event whether by means of an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger  combination  reclassification  recapitalization or otherwise in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock that o is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange  or o is approved  or immediately after the transaction or event will be approved  for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar united states system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices 
the term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the notes or our common stock 
our obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
a public market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained 
the initial purchasers of the notes  although they have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes  are not obligated to do so and may discontinue this market making activity at any time without notice 
in addition  market making activity by the initial purchasers will be subject to the limits imposed by the securities act and the exchange act of  as amended 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any market for the notes will develop or  if one does develop  that it will be maintained 
if an active market for the notes fails to develop or be sustained  the trading price of the notes could be materially adversely affected 
events with respect to our share capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market  or the availability of such shares for sale  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
an adverse effect on the price of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price of the notes 
we had  shares of common stock outstanding as of june  the following securities that may be exercised for  or are convertible into  shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding as of june  o options 
stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share  of this total   were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share as of such date 
o series a preferred stock 
 shares of our series a preferred stock are outstanding  which were convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as of such date 
o convertible subordinated notes 
notes which will convert to  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of as of such date 
the shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options and upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes are currently registered with the sec 
the shares of common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the series a preferred stock are eligible for sale without any volume limitations pursuant to rule k under the securities act 
the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders or discourage a takeover 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in may   our board of directors authorized shares of series b preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series b preferred stock to holders of the common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series b preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as a result of the initial offering of the notes  our long term debt is  this indebtedness has affected us by o significantly increasing our interest expense and related debt service costs  and o making it more difficult to obtain additional financing 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy the annual debt service payments that will be required under the notes 
this may require us to use a portion of the proceeds of the notes to pay interest or borrow additional funds or sell additional equity to meet our debt service obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result  which would negatively impact our future prospects 
the market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the notes 
our notes have not been rated 
as a result  holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt 
historically  the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such securities 
if the notes are traded  they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price  depending on  among other things  prevailing interest rates  the markets for similar securities  general economic conditions and our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt 
such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of  and trading markets for  the notes  independent of our financial performance or prospects 
in addition  certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt  which may further suppress demand for such securities 
we cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions 
any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was negative for all periods presented  other than the years ended june  and  because we incurred net losses in the periods prior to the year ended june  the dollar amounts of the deficiencies for these periods and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended june  and are disclosed below dollars in thousands year ended june  ratio of earnings to fixed charges n a n a n a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges n a n a    earnings consist of net income loss plus fixed charges less capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs and that portion of rental expense we believe to be representative of interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities and time deposits 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at june  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in four years or less
