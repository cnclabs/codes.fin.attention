item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development 
overview our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in the first quarter of  we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices  resulting in lower revenues and net income during this period 
however  in the summer of and continuing through  prices improved 
for the months of april through october  we had certain natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of this price environment 
see the commodity price swaps and options discussion about hedging on page despite this limitation  our realized natural gas price for each month in the year was higher than the same month of any previous year 
in the final months of and into early  the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices 
we benefited from this market with our realized natural gas price reaching per mcf in december and per mcf in january when the nymex futures market was near its high on the last day of december  we entered into a series of price collars that protected us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in october these price collar arrangements boosted revenue by million  increasing the average realized natural gas price by per mcf 
the table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of index represents the henry hub index price 
the price is the natural gas price realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar arrangements in per mcf natural gas prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market fell through the table below contains the west texas intermediate index price index and our realized crude oil prices by month for in per bbl crude oil prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index we reported earnings of per share  or million  for this is up from the per share  or million  reported in the improvement is a result of the stronger commodity price environment during the year and the impact of the natural gas price collar arrangements  which combined to push our realized natural gas price up to per mcf 
additionally  natural gas production was up and crude oil sales volumes were up from last year 
overall  on a mcf equivalent basis  our production grew more than over a production increase was a result of our drilling successes in and  and the remaining increase resulted from the acquisition of cody company  which was effective august  a discussion of our results from recurring operations can be found in the results of operations section  beginning on page before taking into account selected items  net income for was million  or per share  and million  or per share for in august  we acquired the stock of cody company  the parent of cody energy llc cody acquisition for million consisting of million of cash and  shares of common stock valued at million 
substantially all of the proved reserves of cody company are located in the onshore gulf coast region 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
as such  the company reflected the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value in the company s balance sheet effective august  and the results of operations of cody company beginning august  in  these acquired properties contributed bcfe of production  million of operating revenue and million of operating expenses including million of dd a expense 
additional costs included million of interest expense 
these properties contributed million in operating cash flow to the purchase price totaling approximately million was allocated to specific assets and liabilities based on certain estimates of fair values  resulting in approximately million allocated to property and million allocated to working capital items 
this million was comprised of non cash common stock consideration of million and a non cash deferred tax gross up of million and acquisition related fees and costs of million 
the deferred tax gross up pertains to the deferred income taxes attributable to the differences between the tax basis and the estimated fair value of the acquired oil and gas properties 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells and an success rate in total capital expenditures were million for  including million in cash and million in common stock paid for cody company  compared to million in capital spent in drilling activity increased million  with the largest activity increase coming in the gulf coast region  where we continued to develop the etouffee  augen and lake pelto prospects in south louisiana and initiated new exploration in south texas 
we increased our spending for seismic data  both d and d  and lease acquisition costs both in the gulf coast and rocky mountains in order to evaluate and expand our drilling opportunities for and beyond 
the largest portion of this spending occurred in december total equivalent production for was bcfe  an increase of over of this increase  resulted from drilling activity and the remaining was a result of the production from the acquired cody company properties 
at the end of  our debt to total capitalization ratio was  up slightly from the end of this result was achieved despite expending million as cash consideration in the cody acquisition which was sourced primarily by the issuance of million in private placement notes 
during  we improved our debt to total capitalization ratio from at the end of to at the close of this improvement was a result of several significant accomplishments 
we sold million shares of common stock in may for net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repurchase all of our preferred stock 
the remaining proceeds  along with another million from employee stock option exercises  were used to reduce debt and pay dividends 
from year end to year end  we reduced debt by million 
we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit  concentrating on the highest expected return opportunities  and from synergistic acquisitions 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the price of natural gas and oil  our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
however  in the summer of  our realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high levels and by january  we realized the highest prices in the company s history 
then in  our realized natural gas price declined throughout the year to a low of per mcf in december 
a mild winter and the economic recession may be contributing factors in the pricing volatility 
the primary sources of cash during were funds generated from operations  proceeds from the issuance of notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of stock 
funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures  including the acquisition of cody company in august  and dividend payments 
we had a net cash outflow of million during the net cash inflow from operating activities of million combined with the increase in debt of million to substantially fund the million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures 
cash proceeds from the sales of non strategic assets and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional million of cash flow 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in and cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in these improvements were primarily a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent to increased natural gas and oil production 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in included the million cash portion of the cody company acquisition 
additionally  capital spending for drilling and facilities increased million  or  from last year to million 
we drilled gross wells  which represents a increase over cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in included the impact of issuing million in a private placement of notes in july used to partially fund the cody company acquisition 
partially offsetting this debt increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility and the may prepayment of million in debt that was due in may cash flows provided by financing activities in included million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock  both in a block trade and through the exercise of employee stock options 
of the proceeds  million was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
additional cash used in financing activities included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay dividends to stockholders 
cash flows used by financing activities in included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks  the revolving term of which runs to december the available credit line under this facility  currently million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
accordingly  oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation 
since the current price environment remains volatile  management can not predict how future price levels may change the banks long term price outlook 
to reduce the impact of any redetermination  we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
at year end  this excess capacity totaled million  or of the total available credit line 
management believes it has the ability to finance  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance 
please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  we have a period of days to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line 
the revolving credit agreement also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the adjusted credit line within the first days of any adjustment 
our interest expense is expected to be approximately million  including interest on the million weighted average fixed rate notes used to partially fund the acquisition of cody company 
in may  a million principal payment was made on the notes 
this amount had been reflected as current portion of long term debt on the balance sheet 
additionally  the final million payment on these notes that was due in may was paid in may using existing capacity on the revolving credit agreement 
capitalization our capitalization information is as follows as of december  in millions long term debt current portion of long term debt total debt stockholders equity common stock net of treasury stock preferred stock total equity total capitalization debt to capitalization during  dividends were paid on our common stock totaling million 
we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition and capital requirements 
in may  we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the holder for million 
since this stock had been recorded at a stated value of million on our balance sheet  we realized a negative dividend to preferred stockholders of million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering primarily to fund this transaction 
after repurchasing the preferred stock  the excess proceeds were used to reduce debt 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expenses total the amount includes the million common stock component of the cody acquisition and excludes the million deferred tax gross up 
see note  cody acquisition 
total capital and exploration expenditures for increased million compared to  primarily as a result of the million cody acquisition 
the remaining increase of million was due primarily to increased drilling activity as well as increases in leasehold acquisitions costs consistent with our future drilling plans 
the drilling program included an over increase in net wells drilled and a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses  including costs of obtaining seismic data that supports future drilling programs 
we plan to drill gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from million in  which was our largest capital program to date 
expected spending in includes million for drilling and dry hole exposure  million for lease acquisition and million in geological and geophysical expenses 
in addition to the drilling and exploration program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types on contracts note agreements and leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt     operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      the million shown as scheduled for payment in represents the december  balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
typically  we are able to replace this credit agreement with a new one as this comes due 
see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of operating leases can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no capital leases 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three most significant policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets when adopted 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk in a number of ways 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as natural gas price collar arrangements to reduce the impact of declining pricing on our revenue 
under a price collar arrangement  there is also risk that the index prices will rise above the ceiling price and the company will not be able to realize the full benefit of the market improvement 
we covered of our production in with natural gas price collar arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months 
if we had not had these collars in place in  our realized natural gas price would have been per mcf higher 
in  we covered of our natural gas production with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several months 
the gains from the price collars improved our annual realized natural gas price by per mcf 
successful efforts method of accounting we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
under this method  acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
exploration costs  including seismic purchases and processing  exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
during  we drilled exploratory wells and of them were unsuccessful  adding million to exploration expense 
this success rate for exploratory wells is not unusual  and as we focus more on our exploration program  we are exposed to the risk of dry hole expense 
development costs  including the costs to drill and equip development wells  and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 
we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows 
this may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
we determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields 
the impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 
the quality and quantity of available data  
the interpretation of that data  
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and 
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimates of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets when adopted 
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks  including 
blowouts  cratering and explosions  
mechanical problems  
uncontrolled flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  
fires  
formations with abnormal pressures  
pollution and other environmental risks  and 
natural disasters 
the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase these risks 
any of these events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as appalachia 
other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we generate tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounts to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the appalachian region and rocky mountains during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is estimated to be per mmbtu in in and  we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in and an estimated million in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and the notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   the calculated ratio for was to in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
conclusion our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms 
the average produced natural gas sales price received by us has changed from year to year as follows increased over to per mcf increased over to per mcf increased over to per mcf decreased from to per mcf increased over to per mcf the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in with wide price swings in day to day trading on the nymex futures market 
given this continued price volatility  we can not predict with certainty what pricing levels will be in the future 
because future cash flows are subject to these variables  there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures 
while our plan now includes million in capital and exploration spending  we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements  including  if necessary  reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or common stock dividends 
we believe our capital resources  supplemented with external financing if necessary  are adequate to meet our capital requirements 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information 
see forward looking information on page recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after june   sfas also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas also requires unallocated negative goodwill in a case where the purchase price is less than fair market value of the acquired assets to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain  rather than deferred and amortized 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the company does not believe that the adoption of these statements will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb also approved for issuance sfas asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets such as wells and production facilities 
sfas guidance covers the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the company will adopt the statement effective no later than january   as required 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in august  the fasb also approved sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas replaces sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
sfas requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally are to be applied prospectively 
at this time  the company cannot estimate the effect of this statement on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

because they are not a part of our normal business  we have isolated their effects in the table above 
these selected items for were as follows 
the change in derivative fair value related to the adoption of sfas on january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

a severance tax refund of million million pre tax was received in the third quarter for taxes previously paid in louisiana that recently qualified for the severance tax relief program as deep wells 

a total impairment of million million pre tax recorded in two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired in the third quarter since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
also  one natural gas processing plant in the rocky mountains area was written down to fair market value 
in the fourth quarter  the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired 

as a result of the enron bankruptcy  we recorded million million pre tax of bad debt expense primarily related to physical natural gas sales made to enron in november these selected items for were as follows 
a million impairment million after tax was recorded on the beaurline field in south texas as a result of a casing collapse in two of the field s wells 

as a result of repurchasing all of the preferred stock at less than the book value  we recorded a million negative stock dividend in may 
miscellaneous net revenue  primarily from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract  was recorded in the first quarter million after tax 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

as a result of bankruptcy proceedings of two of our customers  we recorded million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter million after tax 

we announced the closure of the regional office in pittsburgh in may and recorded costs of million million after tax 
these costs were recorded in the income statement categories that will receive the future savings benefit million in operations  million in exploration and million in administration 
these selected items for were as follows 
we had a year cogeneration contract under which we sold approximately of our western region natural gas per year 
the contract was due to expire in  but during we reached an agreement with the counterparty under which the counterparty bought out the remainder of the contract for million 
this transaction  completed in december  accelerated the realization of any future price premium that may have been associated with the contract and added million of pre tax other revenue million after tax 
we simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity of western region gas production through april at similar prices to those in the old contract 
the natural gas sales price stated in this new contract was significantly below year end market prices in the region 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairments totaling million on two of our producing fields in the gulf coast region million after tax 
the chimney bayou field was impaired by million due to a significant reserve revision on the broussard middleton r well in connection with a decline in its natural gas production accompanied by a marked increase in water production 
the broussard middleton r was the only producing well in this field 
the lawson field was impaired by million due to an unsuccessful workover on one of its wells 

we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas assets  most notably the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region sold to enervest effective october million after tax 

we recorded a million reserve against other revenue for certain wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the section tight gas sands credit following an industry tax court ruling million after tax 
late in  the ferc issued a rule proposal that may ultimately restore the eligibility for some or all of the wells in question 
for an update on the ferc s actions  please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
and compared the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above 
net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million rise in natural gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production  and the million increase in crude oil sales revenue 
natural gas revenue and our realized price were bolstered by a million gain on natural gas price collar arrangements used during see further discussion in item a 
these improvements were partially offset by a decline in brokered natural gas volume that reduced operating revenues by million 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to per mcf in natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in august natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf  or  to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during the past three years 
natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf  or  to bcf  as a result of lower than anticipated success of the oriskany drilling program in the region in late and into total natural gas production was up bcf  or  in crude oil prices fell per bbl  or  to  resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of approximately million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year doubled to  mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
this production increase was a result of our drilling success in south louisiana increase and the acquisition of cody company increase 
brokered natural gas revenue decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas rose  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
the volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by  reducing revenues by million 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a net margin of million in compared to a net margin of million in excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in  other operating revenues increased million to million 
this increase in is primarily the result of a settlement received as a result of a lawsuit and increased revenue from the sale of natural gas liquids 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations  excluding the selected items related to the impairment of long lived assets and bad debt in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in pittsburgh during  increased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost decreased million  or  primarily due to the million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales in this was partially offset by a million increase due to higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the cody company properties acquired in august additionally  increased staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded drilling program 
on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in as a result of the increased production discussed above 

exploration expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the following 
a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions 

a million increase in dry hole costs 
although the drilling success rate improved from in to in  we drilled a total of gross wells in  a increase over we recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast region versus only two in we also recorded four exploratory dry holes in the rocky mountains area and seven in the appalachian region for a total of  up from a company total of seven in 
a million increase for salaries  wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program 

depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense  excluding the selected item related to the sfas impairment in each year  increased million  or  over natural gas equivalent production increased  increasing dd a expense by million 
the increase in the per unit expense from per mcfe to per mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost gulf coast region including the newly acquired cody properties and resulted in an million increase to dd a expense for 
general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily as a result of increased staffing during the transition period following the cody company acquisition and other staffing increases that support our larger operations 
additional cost increases were realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology updates and related software maintenance 

taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense decreased million due to a lower weighted average interest rate realized in this was despite the new notes issued to partially fund the acquisition of cody company in august income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
our effective tax rate decreased in reflecting a shift of activity between states 
and compared the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account the selected items discussed above 
net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million rise in natural gas sales due to the increase in gas prices  and the million increase in brokered natural gas sales revenue 
operating revenues were reduced by a million loss on natural gas price collar arrangements used during see further discussion in item a 
price and production volume increases in crude oil also contributed to the higher operating revenues 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing revenues by million 
natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was down bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production difficulties in the beaurline field and delays in bringing new production on line in south louisiana 
natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during and natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf to bcf  as a result of the sale of certain non strategic assets in the appalachian region effective october   and a decrease in drilling activity in the region 
total natural gas production was down bcf  or  generating a revenue decrease of million in crude oil prices rose per bbl  or  to  resulting in an increase to operating revenues of approximately million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year increased slightly to mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
brokered natural gas revenue increased million  or  over the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas rose  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
the volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by  reducing revenues by million 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a net margin of million in excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in  and the sales contract buyout and the section tax credit provision in  other operating revenues increased million to million 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations  excluding the selected items related to the impairment of long lived assets in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in pittsburgh during  increased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost increased million  or  primarily due to the million impact of higher purchased natural gas prices 
this was partially offset by a million reduction to purchased natural cost  the result of fewer brokered sales this year compared to the prior year 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of costs associated with the expansion of the gulf coast regional office  both in staffing and office facilities 
additionally  operational costs for surface equipment and compressor maintenance were up in the rocky mountains area where we drilled more net wells in compared to on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in 
exploration expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the following 
a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to increased drilling activity in all regions 

a million increase in delay rental costs over last year largely due to delays in scheduled drilling projects in the gulf coast region 

a million increase for salaries  wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program 

a million increase in dry hole costs 
although the drilling success rate improved from in to in  we recorded two exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast region versus only one in 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense  excluding the selected item related to the sfas impairment in each year  increased million  or  over a decrease in total natural gas equivalent production caused the expense to remain just slightly above last year s level  despite the increase in the per unit expense to per mcfe 

general and administrative expenses remained at the same level as in 
taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower average levels of borrowing on the revolving credit facility 
income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
no significant asset sale activity occurred in gain on the sale of assets was million for these gains are the result of the non strategic asset divestitures  primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region to enervest effective october item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
oil and gas prices declined substantially in and early  moved higher through and into before declining back to year end levels in october because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include 
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 

the level of consumer product demand 

weather conditions 

political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 

the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 

the price of foreign imports 

actions of governmental authorities 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations 

the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

overall economic conditions 
these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets 
currently we are focusing on protection from natural gas price declines  particularly in light of our capital spending plans 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management overseas our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
commodity price swaps and options hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling mmcf  representing of the company s natural gas production 
we did not have crude oil swap arrangements covering our production in during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling mmcf  representing less than of the company s natural gas production 
the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was mbbls at a price of per bbl  which represented approximately of our total oil production for during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling  mmcf  representing of the company s natural gas production 
the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was mbbls at a price of per bbl  which represented approximately one third of our total oil production for the natural gas price swap arrangement that we entered into during the third quarter of covered a portion of production over the period of october through september however  the counterparty declared bankruptcy in december based on the terms of the natural gas swap contract  this action resulted in the cancellation of the contract 
at the time of cancellation  the contract s value was less than million 
as of the years ending december   and  we had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production as follows natural gas price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmcf contract price in millions as of december  none as of december  natural gas price swaps on production in full year full year full year financial derivatives related to natural gas production reduced revenues by million in and million in we had no open oil price swap contracts outstanding on our production at december st of or financial derivatives related to crude oil reduced revenue by million during  but had no impact on results 
hedges on production options in december  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of costless collars 
under the costless collar arrangements  if the index rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the applicable index falls below the floor  the counterparty pays us 
the natural gas price hedges include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production 
these hedges were in place for the months of february through october and covered  mmcf  or  of our natural gas production for the year 
all indexes were within the collars during february and april  some fell below the floor during the period of march  and all indexes were below the floor from june through october  resulting in a million cash revenue for the year 
these gains contributed per mcf to our average realized natural gas price for during  we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a portion of our natural gas production 
there were seven collar arrangements based on separate regional price indexes with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
these collars were in place during the months of april through october during this period  if the index rose above the ceiling price  we paid the counterparty 
if the applicable index fell below the floor price  the counterparty paid us 
these collars covered a total quantity of  mmcf  or of our annual production 
in april and may  the index prices all fell within the price collar and no settlements were made 
in june  all of the indexes rose above the ceiling prices and remained above the ceiling for the duration of the transaction resulting in a million reduction to our realized revenue for the year 
if these hedges had not been in place  our average realized natural gas price for would have been per mcf higher 
again in december of  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our future production through the use of natural gas price collar arrangements 
as of december   we had open natural gas price collar arrangements to hedge our production as follows natural gas price collars volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmcf ceiling floor in millions as of december  natural gas collars on production in first quarter of  second quarter of  as of december  natural gas costless collars on production in first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  the natural gas price hedges open at december   noted above  included several collar arrangements based on nine price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production 
these hedges are in place for the months of january through april and cover approximately of our anticipated natural gas production during this period 
a premium totaling million was paid to purchase these collar arrangements 
hedges on brokered transactions we use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered transactions 
typically  we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a variable price based on the market index price 
however  in some circumstances  some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the contract 
after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of our customers or suppliers  we may use price swaps to effectively convert these fixed price contracts to market sensitive price contracts 
these price swaps are held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes 
we entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of  mmcf in and  mmcf in related to our brokered activities  representing and respectively  of our total volume of brokered natural gas sold 
we did not use price swaps on brokered transactions in as of the years ending december  and  we had no open natural gas price swap contracts on brokered transactions 
financial derivatives related to natural gas reduced revenues by less than million in and had no impact on revenue in we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
adoption of sfas we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas on january  under sfas  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge 
under sfas  effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas was sold at the henry hub index 
any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 
when we adopted sfas  we had two types of hedges in place 
the first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural gas sold in the gulf coast region through september based on the index price strip  the impact of this hedge on january  was to record a hedge loss of million and a charge to other comprehensive income of million 
correspondingly  a hedge liability for million was established 
this instrument was cancelled in december with the bankruptcy of the counterparty 
no balance related to this hedge remains in other comprehensive income 
the second type of hedge outstanding at january  was a natural gas price costless collar agreement 
we had entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of february through october the collars had two components of value intrinsic value and time value 
under sfas  both components were valued at the end of each reporting period 
intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar 
if the index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar  the intrinsic value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume 
in accordance with the initial sfas guidance  intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain if the index is below the floor 
starting in under amended guidance on sfas  any changes in the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet  rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to be effective 
these natural gas price collars were considered to be highly effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation  since they were tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold 
also under sfas  the time value component  a market premium discount  was marked to market through the income statement each period 
since these collar arrangements were executed on the last business day of  the net premium value at adoption on january  was zero 
as of december   we had a series of nine natural gas price collar arrangements in place 
in accordance with the latest guidance from the fasb s derivative implementation group  we test the effectiveness of the combined intrinsic and time values and the effective portion of each will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion will be recorded as a gain or loss in the current period 
as of december   we have recorded million of other comprehensive income  a million unrealized hedge gain and a million hedge asset
