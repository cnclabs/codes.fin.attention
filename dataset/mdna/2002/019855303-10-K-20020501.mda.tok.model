item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those under risk factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a media  direct marketing and marketing services company targeting generation y  the more than million boys and girls in the united states between the ages of and our business integrates direct mail catalogs  print media  websites  on campus marketing programs and promotional events  and features a portfolio of brands that are well known among generation y consumers and advertisers 
we reach a significant portion of generation y consumers through our various media assets  direct marketing activities and marketing services programs  and  as a result  we are able to offer advertisers targeted access to the youth market 
we were incorporated in january  launched our alloy website in august and began generating meaningful revenues in august following the distribution of our first alloy catalog 
since then  we have grown rapidly  both organically and through the completion of strategic acquisitions 
we generate revenue from two principal sources merchandising  and sponsorship and advertising 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe  however  the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition merchandise revenues are recognized at the time the products are shipped to customers net of an allowance for sales returns  which is determined in accordance with our return policy and based on historical experience and forecasted trends  and net of any promotional price discounts 
we are subject to seasonal fluctuations in our merchandise sales and results of operations 
we expect its net sales and operating results generally to be lower in the first half of each fiscal year  as compared to the second half of each fiscal year 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus with respect to issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the purpose of this issue discussion was to clarify the classification of shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the consensus reached was that all shipping and handling billed to customers is revenue 
we adopted the provisions of this pronouncement in the third quarter of fiscal  and have presented its consolidated statements of operations in accordance with this issue 
furthermore  eitf issue no 
requires that if shipping costs or handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales  these costs and the line items which include them on the consolidated statements of operations should be disclosed 
we include these costs in selling and marketing expenses in its consolidated statements of operations 
these costs were million  million and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
sponsorship revenues consist primarily of advertising provided for third parties in our media properties 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized as the contracted advertising is delivered pursuant to the terms of each arrangement  and when any of our other obligations are performed  provided that collectability is deemed probable  as determined by us 
delivery of advertising is completed either in the form of the display of an impression  or over the economic life of a print catalog for printed advertisements in this medium 
associated advertising costs are recognized as incurred  and any direct response advertising costs are recorded over the economic life of each catalog offering  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
billings recorded in advance of advertising delivery are deferred until the impressions are delivered 
other revenues consist of book development publishing revenue and other service contracts related to certain of the businesses acquired since the revenues and related expenses earned and incurred in connection with publishing activities are recognized upon publication of such property 
any amounts received prior to publication are treated as advances  and classified as a current liability 
costs paid prior to publication are deferred and classified as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
contract revenues are recognized upon the delivery of the contracted services and when no significant company performance obligation remains 
billings recorded in advance of provision of services are deferred until the services are provided 
in the case of our newspaper advertising placement service  revenue is reported net of amounts paid to suppliers in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the consensus in this issue requires reporting of revenue on a net basis when a company acts as an agent or a broker  and not as a principal  and does not assume the risk and rewards of ownership of goods 
catalog costs catalog costs consist of catalog production and mailing costs 
catalog costs are capitalized and charged to expense over the expected future revenue stream  which is principally three to four months from the date the catalogs are mailed 
catalog costs are included within selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill relating to acquisitions completed prior to june  was being amortized on a straight line basis over lives ranging from three to five years 
pursuant to sfas  there was no goodwill amortization recorded for all acquisitions completed after june  effective february   and in accordance with sfas  goodwill will cease to be amortized 
as of january   our intangible and other assets consist of trademarks  mailing lists  noncompetition agreements  websites and marketing rights 
trademarks currently have indefinite lives  however  the other identified intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from three to five years 
these assets were recorded pursuant to our business acquisitions during fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues year ended january  statements of operations data net merchandise revenues sponsorship and other revenues total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net realized loss gain on marketable securities and investments provision for income taxes charge for early retirement of debt net loss non cash charge attributable to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock issued preferred stock dividends and accretion of discount net loss attributable to common shareholders fiscal years ended january  fiscal  january  fiscal and january  fiscal revenues merchandise revenues 
net merchandise revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and increased from for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in merchandise revenues in fiscal was due primarily to the increased size of our generation y database to which we marketed our merchandise offerings and our expanded merchandise offerings  which were enhanced by the inclusion of merchandise sales from our ccs catalog and website for the full fiscal year versus from july in fiscal  and the inclusion of merchandise sales from our dan s comp catalog and website from late september when the dan s comp acquisition closed 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to similar factors which included merchandise sales from our ccs catalog and website beginning in july in fiscal sponsorship and other revenues 
sponsorship and other revenues increased from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal due primarily to the selling efforts of our expanded in house advertising sales force 
increased website traffic at our websites  increased total catalog circulation  and magazine property development provided more advertising inventory to sell in fiscal relative to fiscal our advertising and sponsorship sales efforts were further enhanced in fiscal by the sales forces and services provided by private colleges universities  acquired in april  cass communications  acquired in august  and youth  acquired in november sponsorship and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the full year of sales force efforts in fiscal versus only six months of effort in fiscal as this unit commenced activity in july  along with the increased traffic to our websites and expanded catalog circulation in fiscal cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the merchandise sold by us plus the freight cost to deliver the merchandise to the warehouse  together with the direct costs attributable to the sponsorship and advertising programs we provide and the publications we develop and produce 
our cost of goods sold increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and to million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increase in merchandise sales to our growing customer base 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to the inclusion of lower margin ccs merchandise sales from july when our ccs acquisition closed  offset by an increased overall percentage of higher margin sponsorship and other revenues generated in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to from in fiscal due to the full year inclusion of lower margin ccs merchandise sales and the lower margin dan s comp merchandise sales from september when this acquisition closed  offset by an increased overall percentage of higher margin sponsorship and other revenues generated in fiscal operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs  our call center and fulfillment operations expenses  freight costs in shipping to our merchandise customers  salaries of our sales and marketing personnel  marketing costs  and expenses related to the development  maintenance and marketing of our websites 
these selling and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  due to the increased costs incurred in marketing  selling and shipping to our expanded database in greater volume  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  and increased spending on website development and maintenance 
these selling and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  due to the increased costs of enlarged catalog circulation  fulfilling an increased number of merchandise orders  more extensive website promotion and development  and the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling and marketing expenses decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  after declining from for fiscal to in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from our more targeted merchandise marketing to our enlarged generation y database  reduced general advertising and marketing activity  and greater sales force efficiency in selling sponsorship and advertising services packages 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to more targeted merchandise marketing to more productive names in our generation y database  fulfillment efficiencies associated with higher order volumes  and reduced general advertising and marketing activity 
fulfillment expenses rose from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and to million for fiscal  but as a percentage of total revenues fell from for fiscal to for fiscal  and to for fiscal as increased scale and improved forecasting have generated fulfillment efficiencies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative  finance and management personnel  as well as support services and professional service fees 
these expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  and to million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was driven by an increase in compensation expense for additional personnel to handle our growing business  together with expenses incurred as a result of becoming a public company after our initial public offering in may  such as professional fees  insurance premiums and public relations costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  our general and administrative expenses decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal to for fiscal as we have spread our overhead expenses across an enlarged revenue base 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow as we hire additional personnel and incur additional expenses related to the growth of our business and our operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal and  for fiscal these costs resulted from our acquisition activities  which commenced in fiscal all of our acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as further discussed in recent accounting pronouncements below  the financial accounting standards board fasb has adopted statements in july regarding business combinations and intangible assets 
the statements eliminated goodwill amortization for acquisitions completed after june and eliminate amortization of all goodwill and require an annual impairment review of goodwill based on fair value commencing in our fiscal year accordingly  future periods will be impacted by these statements for the elimination of amortization and potential impairments of goodwill to be recognized 
loss from operations as described above  we continue to invest heavily to build our consumer brands  grow and market to our customer database  enhance and attract visitors to our websites  increase the number of our employees to support a growing operation  and make strategic acquisitions 
for these reasons  our loss from operations increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  while the loss decreased in fiscal to million as we generated greater efficiencies in our direct marketing operations and benefited from increased scale in our sponsorship activities 
interest income  net interest income net of expense includes income from our cash and cash equivalents and from investments and expenses related to our financing obligations 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we generated net interest income of million  million and  respectively  due to the investment of proceeds raised in our initial public offering and our subsequent issuances of common and preferred stock 
realized loss gain on marketable securities and investments and charge for early retirement of debt in fiscal  we unwound our collars on  shares of liberty digital ldig common stock and sold  shares of ldig 
the series of transactions resulted in a gain of  in fiscal  we sold  shares of liberty digital common stock resulting in a loss on sale of approximately million 
we also wrote off a minority investment in a private company in fiscal resulting in a loss on investment of million 
as a result of the early retirement of our outstanding promissory notes upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  we incurred a one time extraordinary charge of income tax expense in fiscal  we were subject to income tax expense of  due to operating income generated at the state level

the significant increase in sponsorship and other revenues recognized in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal reflects the seasonal peak sales of this business for back to school and holiday  together with the inclusion of cass communications revenues from august and youth s revenues from late november our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues has ranged between approximately and with the higher percentages occurring in quarters that have a relatively higher percentage of sponsorship and other revenues 
the level of our selling and marketing expenses is generally correlated with our catalog circulation and merchandise selling cycle which peaks in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year and troughs in the first and second quarters 
general and administrative expenses have been rising as a result of increasing personnel  increasing operating costs of our growing business and costs related to our being a public company 
as a percentage of revenues  our selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses tend to decline in our fiscal third and fourth quarters due to seasonally higher order volumes and order values relative to catalogs circulated  and the leverage that we have on our fixed expense base when our revenues seasonally peak 
we expect our quarterly revenues  margins and results of operations to fluctuate significantly in the future 
in addition  the results of any quarter do not indicate results that should be expected for a full fiscal year 
if our revenues  margins or operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  then the price of our common stock could decline 
seasonality our historical revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in consumer purchasing patterns 
sales of apparel  accessories  footwear and action sports equipment through our websites and catalogs have been higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters which contain the key back to school and holiday selling seasons  than in our first and second fiscal quarters 
we believe that advertising and sponsorship sales will follow a similar pattern with higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters as marketers more aggressively attempt to reach our generation y audience during these major spending seasons 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities as we have generated negative cash flow from operations prior to fiscal at january   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our principal commitments at january  consisted of accounts payable  accrued expenses and obligations under operating and capital leases 
in fiscal  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sales of our series a and series b convertible preferred stock in february and june  respectively  in november  we raised approximately million from the sale in a private placement of  shares of our common stock  and in january  we raised approximately million of net proceeds from the sale in a private placement of  shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
subsequently  in february  we raised approximately million  net of expenses and underwriters discounts  in an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as a result of more efficient database marketing  greater media sales force productivity and general expense control  offset by growth in operating assets  primarily accounts receivable from our sponsorship and advertising sales activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the principal use of cash for each of these fiscal years was to fund our losses from operations and to finance growth of non cash working capital to support our growing business 
reference is made to note of the consolidated financial statements wherein all of our significant commercial commitments are discussed 
we do not currently have any debt instruments  all commitments consist of lease obligations and standby letters of credit 
as of january   there were no amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
there were also no current commitments for capital expenditures 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal due primarily to the use of million of cash to fund our acquisitions of private colleges universities  cass communications  dan s comp  youth and estudentloan  and million of capital expenditures 
cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal resulted from million provided by net sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by million used in connection with business acquisitions  primarily to repay debt obligations of the acquired ccs business  million of capital expenditures and million invested in a private company 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million resulted primarily from the investment of million in initial public offering proceeds in marketable securities  million in business acquisitions and million in capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities totaled million primarily from the net proceeds raised in the issuance of our common stock in two private placement transactions and of our series a and series b convertible preferred stock  together with proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
as a result of the issuance of our series a and series b convertible preferred stock  we recorded a beneficial conversion feature of million and accretion and dividends of million in fiscal which together increased the net loss attributable to common shareholders by million in the year 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily from the net cash proceeds of our sale of  shares of our common stock to a subsidiary of liberty digital 
cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily the result of our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock offset by the repayment of million of promissory notes 
our liquidity position as of january   consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and  as adjusted for the net proceeds of our underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock in february  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect that our liquidity position will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional capital 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  you may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when we need it or  if available  financing may not be on terms we consider favorable 
if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services 
in addition  we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures 
any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
these standards change the accounting for business combinations by  among other things  prohibiting the prospective use of pooling of interests accounting and requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life created by business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
the new standards generally will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal and for purchase business combinations consummated after june  upon adoption  we will stop amortizing goodwill 
based on the current level of goodwill and its associated amortization  this would reduce annual amortization expense by approximately million 
because goodwill amortization is nondeductible for tax purposes  the impact of stopping goodwill amortization would be to increase our annual net income by approximately million 
in addition  we are in the process of evaluating certain intangible assets to determine whether they are deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
we expect that only acquired trademarks and trade names have indefinite useful lives 
as noted above  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
an independent third party valuation report as of january  indicated that there is no impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
accordingly  we do not expect any impact upon adoption of fas if  however  we conclude that an impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life is necessary in a future period  any required charge would reflected as an operating expense in the period such impairment is deemed to exist 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
this statement retains the requirements of fasb statement no 
to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and to measure such impairment as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
goodwill is specifically excluded from the provisions of this statement 
the statement further provides guidance for cash flow estimations under certain situations 
additionally  the statement clarifies accounting for disposals other than by a sale  as well as for long lived assets held for sale 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement and will adopt the required accounting and reporting as of february  in july  the eitf reached a consensus with respect to issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the purpose of this issue discussion was to clarify the classification of shipping and handling revenues and costs 
the consensus reached was that all shipping and handling billed to customers is revenue 
we adopted the provisions of this pronouncement in the third quarter of fiscal  and have presented our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with this issue 
furthermore  we reclassified our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended january  and to conform with this consensus as we previously netted shipping and handling revenues with the related costs and included the residual amount as selling and marketing expenses 
the impact of this reclassification resulted in an increase of net merchandise revenues of  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively  offset by an equivalent increase in selling and marketing expenses for these periods 
furthermore  eitf issue no 
requires that if shipping costs or handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales  these costs and the line items which include them on the consolidated statements of operations should be disclosed 
we include these costs in selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
these costs were   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the eitf is also discussing issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue deals with the accounting for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed 
the eitf is considering how to determine the units of accounting in an arrangement and how to account for the components as well as the direct costs incurred in connection with an arrangement 
the key consideration is the determination of objective measures of fair value 
while this issue was not applicable to our historical transactions  future results may be impacted by applicable arrangements that are within the scope of this issue 
no final consensus has been reached with respect to these matters 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this report on form k may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding our current expectations and beliefs regarding our future results or performance 
such statements are subject to certain factors  risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  events and performance to differ materially from those referred to or implied by such statements 
in addition  actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated  depending on a variety of factors  which include  but are not limited to  achieving and maintaining profitability  expanding and utilizing our database  our ability to build brand recognition  and our ability to increase our advertising customers and programs 
information with respect to important factors that should be considered is contained in the risk factors that may affect future results section below 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in management s expectations  except as required by law 
risk factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
since our inception in january  we have incurred significant net losses 
we have never reported positive net income for a full fiscal year  and we may never do so 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we expect to generate positive net income in fiscal  there is no assurance that we will do so 
our business may not grow in the future 
since our inception  we have rapidly expanded our business  growing from revenues of million for fiscal to million for fiscal our continued growth will depend to a significant degree on our ability to increase revenues from our merchandising businesses  to maintain existing sponsorship and advertising relationships and to develop new relationships  to integrate acquisitions  and to maintain and enhance the reach and brand recognition of our existing media franchises and new media franchises that we create or acquire 
our ability to implement our growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond our control including i the continuing appeal of our media and marketing properties to generation y consumers  ii the continued perception by participating advertisers and sponsors that we offer an effective marketing channel for their products and services  iii our ability to select products that appeal to our customer base and to market such products effectively to our target audience  iv our ability to attract  train and retain qualified employees and management and v our ability to make additional strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
we may fail to use our generation y database and our expertise in marketing to generation y consumers successfully  and we may not be able to maintain the quality and size of our database 
the effective use of our generation y consumer database and our expertise in marketing to generation y are important components of our business 
if we fail to capitalize on these assets  our business will be less successful 
as individuals in our database age beyond generation y  they may no longer be of significant value to our business 
we must therefore continuously obtain data on new individuals in the generation y demographic in order to maintain and increase the size and value of our database 
if we fail to obtain sufficient new names and information  our business could be adversely affected 
moreover  there are other generation y focused media businesses that possess similar information about some segments of generation y 
we compete for sponsorship and advertising revenues based on the comprehensive nature of our database and our ability to analyze and interpret the data in our database 
accordingly  if one or more of our competitors were to create a database similar to ours  or if a competitor were able to analyze its data more effectively than we can  our competitive position  and therefore our business  could suffer 
our success depends largely on the value of our brands  and if the value of our brands were to diminish  our business would be adversely affected 
the prominence of our alloy  ccs and dan s comp catalogs and websites and our related consumer magazines among our generation y target market  and the prominence of our cass communications  youth and private colleges universities brands and media franchises with advertisers are key components of our business 
if our consumer brands or their associated merchandise and editorial content lose their appeal to generation y consumers  our business could be adversely affected 
the value of our consumer brands could also be eroded by misjudgments in merchandise selection or by our failure to keep our content current with the evolving preferences of our audience 
these events would likely also reduce sponsorship and advertising sales for our merchandise and publishing businesses and may also adversely affect our marketing and services businesses 
moreover  we anticipate that we will continue to increase the number of generation y consumers we reach  through means which may include broadening the intended audience of our existing consumer brands or creating or acquiring new media franchises or related businesses 
misjudgments by us in this regard could damage our existing or future brands 
if any of these developments occur  our business would suffer 
our revenues and income could decline due to general economic trends  declines in consumer spending and seasonality 
our revenues are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending or advertising seeking to stimulate that spending 
advertising expenditures and consumer spending all tend to decline during recessionary periods  and may also decline at other times 
accordingly  our revenues could decline during any general economic downturn 
in addition  our revenues have historically been higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  coinciding with the start of the school calendar and holiday season spending  than in the first half of our fiscal year 
therefore  our results of operations in our third and fourth fiscal quarters may not be indicative of our full fiscal year performance 
our inability to acquire suitable businesses or to manage their integration could harm our business 
we expect to expand our reach by acquiring complementary businesses  products and services 
we compete with other media and related businesses for these opportunities 
therefore  even if we identify targets we consider desirable  we may not be able to complete those acquisitions on terms we consider attractive or at all 
we could have difficulty in assimilating personnel and operations of the businesses we have acquired and may have similar problems with future acquisitions 
these difficulties could disrupt our business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may issue additional equity securities  potentially on terms which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we must effectively manage our vendors to minimize inventory risk and maintain our margins 
we seek to avoid maintaining high inventory levels in an effort to limit the risk of outdated merchandise and inventory writedowns 
if we underestimate quantities demanded by our customers and our vendors cannot restock  then we may disappoint customers who may then turn to our competitors 
we require our vendors to meet minimum restocking requirements  but if our vendors cannot meet these requirements and we cannot find alternative vendors  we could be forced to carry more inventory than we have in the past 
our risk of inventory writedowns would increase if we were to hold large inventories of merchandise that prove to be unpopular 
competition may adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to decline 
because of the growing perception that generation y is an attractive demographic for marketers  the markets in which we operate are competitive 
many of our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors in this market  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer user bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these advantages allow our competitors to spend considerably more on marketing and may allow them to use their greater resources more effectively than we can use ours 
accordingly  these competitors may be better able to take advantage of market opportunities and be better able to withstand market downturns than us 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be materially and adversely affected and our stock price will decline 
we rely on third parties for some essential business operations  and disruptions or failures in service may adversely affect our ability to deliver goods and services to our customers 
we depend on third parties for important aspects of our business  including some of our call center and fulfillment operations 
we have limited control over these third parties  and we are not their only client
