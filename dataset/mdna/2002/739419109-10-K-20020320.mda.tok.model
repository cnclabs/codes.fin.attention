item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview practiceworks  inc practiceworks or we is an information management technology provider for dentists  orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons 
our offerings include practice management applications  ongoing maintenance  support  and training  and internet based services  including electronic data interchange  or edi  services  business to business e commerce services  and website development and hosting 
these applications and services are designed to automate the provider s practice  resulting in greater efficiency  lower costs and higher quality care 
as of march   we had an installed base of approximately  providers  including  dentists   orthodontists and  oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the united states and an additional  providers outside the united states 
prior to march   we operated as a division of vitalworks inc vitalworks  formerly infocure corporation 
on march   vitalworks completed the pro rata distribution spin off of all of the outstanding shares of practiceworks common stock to vitalworks stockholders 
vitalworks currently owns none of our outstanding common stock 
acquisitions a substantial part of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions 
from july  through december   vitalworks completed acquisitions that were attributed to us in the spin off 
subsequent to the spin off we have completed acquisitions through given the significant number of acquisitions in each of the periods presented  the results of operations from period to period may not necessarily be comparable 
on march   we completed the acquisition of softdent  llc  a practice management software subsidiary under dentsply international  inc dentsply 
softdent  llc  now one of our subsidiaries  was the successor to the software technology and business of infosoft  inc infosoft 
infosoft developed and provided dental practice management software systems  which we now market as our softdent software product 
the acquisition of infosoft strengthened our presence in the dental segment of the healthcare information systems market by adding approximately  dentists to our installed customer base and providing a significant increment to our edi revenues 
the acquisition afforded us opportunities for future conversion of the acquired customer base to newer technology offered by us  the potential revenue from our connectivity  imaging and other enhancement offerings and the cost savings realized from eliminating duplicative services and redundancies in staffing 
additionally  at the time of acquisition  infosoft was party to approximately independent value added reseller var agreements 
we elected not to renew the agreements with a number of the var s and we completed transactions to terminate the agreements and or restructure the relationships with respect to of these var s 
the estimated fair value of the total consideration  including var transactions  was approximately million  represented by  shares of our series a convertible redeemable preferred stock valued at million net of discount of million  cash consideration of million  notes payable of approximately million  and transaction costs of million 
we recorded total goodwill of million 
during the second quarter of  we completed two acquisitions that were also accounted for as purchases 
in connection with these acquisitions  we paid cash consideration aggregating million  issued a non interest bearing note payable in the amount of approximately  and assumed net liabilities of approximately  the purchase prices were allocated based on preliminary estimates of fair values to tangible and intangible assets  developed technology and total liabilities assumed 
we recorded goodwill of approximately million  inclusive of approximately  in transaction costs 
additionally  on august   we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of medical dynamics  inc medical dynamics  a dental practice management company  for which the aggregate consideration was approximately million represented by approximately  shares of practiceworks common stock   shares of practiceworks series b convertible redeemable preferred stock   shares of vitalworks common stock and  in cash 
additionally  we assumed million in liabilities and incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
the purchase price was allocated based on an independent valuation of fair values to tangible and intangible assets and total liabilities assumed 
we recorded goodwill of approximately million 
vitalworks issuance of its common stock made in conjunction with completion of the spin off has been accounted for as an equity contribution 
vitalworks acquired six dental practice management companies that were accounted for as purchases during the year ended december  the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was million in cash and million in vitalworks common stock 
goodwill of approximately million was recorded for these transactions 
vitalworks acquired four dental practice management companies that were accounted for as purchases during the year ended december  the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was million in cash and million in vitalworks common stock 
goodwill of million was recorded for these transactions  the five companies listed below the pooled companies were acquired in transactions accounted for as poolings of interests during the year ended december  these mergers provided for the exchange of substantially all of the outstanding equity interests of such companies for shares of vitalworks common stock 
company shares of vitalworks common stock issued omsystems  inc  ardsley  mis  inc  kevin kozlowski  inc  d b a human touch software  unident corporation  infologic  inc  because these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests  the financial statements included in this annual report were retroactively restated to reflect them 
as a result  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows are presented as if the pooled companies had been included for all periods presented see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and non recurring charges due to the significant number of acquisitions we have completed  we announced and implemented restructuring plans in  and to integrate and consolidate the acquired operations into our existing facilities 
we record the costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
liabilities incurred as a result of exiting an activity of acquired companies are recorded in accordance with the guidance of eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
change in business model during the fourth quarter of we made significant changes in our strategic business model including the decision to transition to a subscription based pricing model for the majority of our products 
under the subscription model  revenue for use of our software is recognized ratably over the contract period  typically months  as opposed to recognition at the time of sale under our traditional license model  while the costs of directly related sales activities  together with general and administrative and other direct and indirect costs are expensed currently 
we began offering subscription services in the second quarter of as a result  we experienced significant variations in revenue and net income in and as compared to largely attributable to the transition to the subscription model 
significant accounting policies revenue recognition we base our revenue recognition policies for sales of software on the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenue from maintenance and support services and subscriptions  which typically have contracts varying from one to three years in length  is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from e services is recognized as the service is provided 
revenue from the sale of software licenses is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from hardware sales is recognized upon product shipment 
revenue from training and implementation services is recognized as the service is provided 
amounts invoiced and cash payments received in advance of product or service revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
capitalized costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed costs incurred  such as planning  designing  coding and testing  for computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred prior to establishing the technological feasibility of a product 
technological feasibility is generally achieved when the detailed program design or a working model has been completed 
for the period between the establishment of technological feasibility and the time a product is available for general release  such costs are capitalized 
capitalized software costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated lives of the related products generally months 
capitalized costs for each project are reviewed periodically to determine that the estimated useful lives are appropriate and carrying values are recoverable based on estimated future cash flows and revisions to estimated lives or impairment charges are recorded as necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of consideration given in purchase business combinations over the estimated fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired 
separately identifiable acquired intangible assets primarily represent capitalized software  long term customer relationships  and customer contracts 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations 
sfas no 
also changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill and states the following criteria should be considered in determining the recognition of intangible assets whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other rights  or whether the intangible asset is separable or divisible from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  returned or exchanged 
for acquisitions completed by the company subsequent to june   the fair value of assets and liabilities and the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets are supported by an independent third party valuation  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and requires goodwill and other acquired intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life to no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  concurrent with our change in business model  we revised the estimated useful life of our goodwill from years to three years 
pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
 on july   for acquisitions completed after june  and on january   for all other acquisitions the goodwill will not be amortized 
we continue to amortize separately identifiable acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives over periods ranging from three to years 
the adoption of sfas no 
and provisions of sfas no 
had a positive impact of not requiring goodwill amortization for acquisitions completed subsequent to june   which would have aggregated million  or per share on a pre tax basis  for the period after july  additionally  we will adopt the remaining provisions of sfas no 
effective january  and no longer amortize any goodwill 
we recorded million  or per share on a pre tax basis  related to goodwill amortization in other intangible assets also include deferred loan costs that are amortized over the life of the respective loans at rates that approximate the interest method 
consolidated results of operations segment and market information we report our results from operations in two segments recurring revenue and non recurring revenue 
recurring revenue includes maintenance and support services  subscription services of our software and support and e services including electronic data interchange  or edi  transactions  and royalties and other revenues from e commerce and other internet based services 
non recurring revenue includes one time sales of licenses and systems and fees for training and implementation services 
currently  less than of our revenue and net loss is generated outside the united states 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in thousands year ended december  percent of total year ended december  percent of total dollar change percent change recurring    non recurring    total    total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased as a result of organic growth of million in the core elements of our business and revenues of million attributable to acquisitions  consisting primarily of million attributable to the infosoft acquisition completed in the first quarter of recurring revenue 
recurring revenue is derived from contractual arrangements for maintenance and support services  subscription services of our software and support and from e services 
recurring revenue for the year ended december  increased primarily as a result of increased e services revenue of million  of which million is attributable to acquisitions  organic growth in subscription revenue of million  and growth in maintenance revenue of million attributable primarily to acquisitions 
the increases in subscriptions and e services revenue are largely volume related and include the effects of increased numbers of upgrade and new customers entering into subscription agreements as well as the expansion of e services offered to existing customers 
non recurring revenue 
non recurring revenue includes one time sales of licenses and systems and fees for training and implementation services 
non recurring revenue for the year ended december  increased as a result of a million increase in training and implementation revenue  increased software sales of million  a  increase in other revenues  offset by a decrease in hardware revenue of  increased training and implementation revenue is attributable to growth in our core business as upgrade and new customers implement  primarily by subscription  our newest practice management applications 
increases in net software sales are substantially attributable to acquisitions 
the increase in software sales generated by acquisitions was offset by a reduction in software sales in the core business which  together with the reduction in hardware sales  is the expected result of lower unit sales of one time licenses and systems as we transition to subscription pricing for the majority of our products 
the decrease in hardware revenues is the expected outcome of the decision in not to offer hardware sales in certain business lines and the development of relationships with former var s of infosoft and others to supply hardware and hardware services to our customers in exchange for a referral fee 
costs and expenses in thousands year ended december  percent of sales year ended december  percent of sales dollar change percent change purchases for resale    selling  general and administrative excluding non recurring charges research and development    depreciation and amortization    restructuring   spin off and other non recurring charges   interest expense   benefit provision for income taxes   purchases for resale 
purchases for resale includes costs of processing  forms and postage for edi claims and statements and other e services  purchases of hardware  outsourced hardware maintenance  third party software and other items for resale in connection with the sales of new systems and software 
purchases for resale for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   increased in the aggregate due to the growth in e services  principally related to acquisitions  offset by reduced hardware costs attributable to fewer hardware units sold in certain business lines 
as a percentage of sales  purchases for resale increased compared with the prior year principally due to changes in the sales mix resulting from the reduced level of one time software licenses and the increased level of edi services 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a 
sg a expense includes salaries and benefits  product maintenance and support  variable commissions and bonuses  marketing  travel  communications  facilities  insurance and other administrative expenses 
sg a expense excludes research and development  depreciation and amortization  restructuring and non recurring charges 
sg a expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   increased primarily as a result of the infosoft acquisition  completed in the first quarter of  and the smaller acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of excluding the effects of these acquisitions  sg a expense decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due principally to the net effect of payroll and facilities cost reductions resulting from the august restructuring 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits  supplies  facilities and other administrative expenses associated with ongoing programs that focus on advancing our core practice management and other technologies  developing new products and enhancing the quality and performance of our classic products 
research and development expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a higher proportion of software development costs qualifying for capitalization and  to a lesser extent  cost reductions from restructuring efforts 
we capitalize development costs incurred from the time a new product reaches technological feasibility until it is available for general release 
excluding acquired capitalized software costs  software costs capitalized for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to  of software costs capitalized for the year ended december  the higher level of capitalized costs in compared to reflects the state of development of a variety of projects  including new e services applications and major upgrade versions of several practice management applications that are part of our core product offerings that are scheduled to be released during the first and second quarters of we believe our current commitment levels for research and development will enable us to provide the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position of leadership in our existing market and develop new technologies for new markets 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to the additional goodwill amortization expense from acquisitions  principally infosoft 
goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  in addition  depreciation expense of  was recorded during related to additional assets that were attributed to us in the spin off 
the remainder of depreciation and amortization expense related to depreciation of fixed asset additions and amortization of additional capitalized software development costs 
restructuring 
during the year ended december   we recorded costs of  associated with the restructuring plan entered into to consolidate substantially all of our domestic operations into our atlanta facility and to eliminate approximately employees on a net basis 
the closed facilities had operating leases with various expiration dates through the other costs will be substantially paid in the first half of we expect savings between approximately million and million annually to be realized as a result of the plan beginning in the second quarter of these costs were offset by a  reduction in the plan s accrued restructuring costs relating to the re negotiation of terminated facility leases and the reduction in severance payments resulting from the early departure of employees eligible to receive these payments 
during the year ended december   we incurred restructuring charges of million  consisting of million related to compensation costs for terminated employees  million for terminated facility and other costs and  related to the plan  principally severance 
spin off and other non recurring charges 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in non recurring charges relating primarily to professional fees  printing and similar costs in connection with the completion of the spin off from vitalworks 
during the year ended december   we recorded non recurring charges of million  consisting primarily of million related to inventory impairment  million for charges related to the spin off and  related to assets that were abandoned in the restructuring 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased slightly in comparison to the same period of principally related to increased borrowings associated with acquisitions  the amortization of loan costs incurred due to the spin off and scheduled increases in the interest rate margin on the finova credit facility  offset somewhat by the downward trend in short term interest rates during benefit provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we generated pre tax losses for financial reporting purposes of approximately million and net operating losses nol s for tax purposes of approximately million 
the financial reporting losses differ from the losses for tax purposes primarily due to book versus tax differences in goodwill amortization  including non deductible amounts 
similarly  the effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due to the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization  state taxes and the recognition of a valuation allowance 
for tax purposes approximately million of these nol s were generated prior to the spin off and remained with vitalworks 
the remaining million of these losses for tax purposes generated subsequent to the spin off are attributable to us  will be available to offset any future taxable income we generate and will expire at various dates through in connection with the medical dynamics acquisition  we acquired nol carryforwards totaling approximately million that expire at various dates through these nol carryforwards are subject to limitations resulting from the change in ownership provisions included in the federal tax code 
we applied the limitation provisions and estimate that approximately million of these nol carryforwards could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
the total of all these nol carryforwards create a gross deferred tax asset of approximately million before valuation allowance 
additionally  certain of the assets and liabilities transferred to us in the spin off had temporary differences between their book and tax bases that carried over to us 
our deferred tax assets at december  relating to temporary differences were approximately million 
total deferred tax assets at december   including the nol carryforwards and temporary differences in the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities aggregate million 
as of december   we had recorded a total valuation allowance of approximately million to reduce the total deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
future realization of the deferred tax asset related to the nol of medical dynamics will reduce goodwill and other intangible assets arising from the acquisition since it is fully reserved 
we reported net deferred tax assets at december  of approximately million essentially representing amounts attributable to us based solely on reversing temporary differences as recorded by vitalworks through the spin off date 
we have prepared projections that indicate that our nol s would be absorbed prior to their expiration 
however  we have not recorded the benefit of the nol utilization in the financial statements since projections over multiple years are inherently imprecise 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized based on our financial projections  sales backlog  continued quarter over quarter operational improvements across all business lines for each of the fiscal quarters of  and available tax strategies 
these factors indicate we will generate taxable income within the next one to two years sufficient to realize the tax benefits represented by these future deductible temporary differences 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   and a net loss of million for the year ended december  accrued and accretive dividends on preferred stock 
for the year ended december   we recorded accrued and accretive dividends related to the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock of million to recognize accrual of the dividend and amortization of the million estimated valuation discount 
we also recorded accrued and accretive dividends of  to recognize accrual of the dividend and amortization of the million estimated valuation discount for the series b convertible redeemable preferred stock 
in addition  we recorded accretive dividends of  related to the series c convertible redeemable preferred stock 
there were no preferred instruments outstanding in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in thousands year ended december  percent of total year ended december  percent of total dollar change percent change recurring    non recurring    total    revenue 
for the year ended december   recurring revenue increased largely due to an additional million of revenue  principally maintenance and support  generated by acquisitions made in december and march and april the increase also includes an increase in edi revenue of million for the year ended december   resulting from an increase in the number of practices using this service  and to a lesser extent  revenue related to new subscription contracts 
non recurring revenue  primarily one time sales of licenses and systems decreased as a result of lower unit sales in due to our transition to a subscription pricing model and higher sales resulting from some customers preparing for potential year computer issues 
costs and expenses in thousands year ended december  percent of sales year ended december  percent of sales dollar change percent change purchases for resale    selling  general and administrative excluding non recurring charges research and development   depreciation and amortization    restructuring   spin off and other non recurring charges   interest expense   benefit provision for income taxes   purchases for resale 
for the year ended december   the decrease in purchases for resale as a percentage of revenue reflects the increase in higher margin edi transactions and software maintenance contracts and a decrease in lower margin hardware sales 
we expect to continue to experience decreasing hardware sales in light of our hardware outsourcing arrangements 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a 
of the increase in  approximately million was related to the sg a costs of the december and the acquisitions 
legal and professional fees increased approximately  due to costs related to potential acquisitions and other transactions that were not completed 
we also incurred marketing expenses related to the new subscription pricing model of approximately  during the third quarter of we also increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  the basis for this additional provision was derived from our analysis of the negative effects on collection experience as a result of closing and consolidating offices and reducing staff in conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring plan 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased primarily due to an increase in software development costs eligible for capitalization related to products we will be offering in the future and a decrease in the costs related to products that will be discontinued in the future 
for the year ended december    was capitalized related to software development costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the change in the estimated useful life of goodwill from years to three years during the fourth quarter of and also to acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of and during restructuring 
on august   we announced our intention to terminate approximately employees and to close or consolidate facilities as part of our restructuring plan 
as a result  in the third and fourth quarter of we incurred costs of million related to severance and other termination benefits and facility closure costs and other charges of million 
the remaining closed facilities have operating leases with expiration dates through all other costs were paid during in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan of restructuring and reorganization  which was completed in the second quarter of to consolidate certain facilities and eliminate staffing redundancies involving approximately employees related to acquisitions completed during the restructuring costs for the plan consisted of contingent consideration of  payable to former stockholders of entities whose products were discontinued as part of the restructuring and severance and termination benefits of  and facility closure and other costs of  we recorded approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively for the plan 
spin off and other non recurring charges 
in the year ended december  we recorded charges of million related to our decision to discontinue hardware sales and support for certain of our business lines in connection with new hardware outsourcing agreements and  related to fixed assets which are being disposed of as a result of our decision to consolidate our office locations 
we also incurred costs of million related to the spin off  consisting principally of professional service fees 
in the year ended december   we recorded  in impairment charges related to capitalized software as a result of the change in product strategy announced in the fourth quarter of and merger costs of  in the completion of the acquisitions accounted for as poolings  and  in compensatory stock awards related to the accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award 
interest expense 
interest expense increased due to increases in the amount of the outstanding balances under our credit facility and other debt agreements due principally to acquisitions 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the change from a provision for income taxes to a benefit for income taxes is due to the generation of net operating losses for the year ended december  versus net operating income for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  the variances from the federal statutory rate are due to the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization  state taxes and the recognition of valuation allowance 
we reported net deferred tax assets of million in our financial statements as of december   related to differences between the book and tax basis of our assets 
management has assessed the past financial history  when adjusted for non recurring items such as restructuring charges  as well as our sales backlog and budgeted sales and believes that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income within the next two to three years more than sufficient to realize the tax benefits associated with future deductible temporary differences 
net loss income 
as a result of the above factors  our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund acquisitions  working capital  software development costs  and capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million including the effect of deferred revenue and customer deposits of million 
net cash used by operating activities was  in  an improvement from million used in  but a decrease from cash flow provided from operations of million in the net cash used by operating activities for includes cash payments of million for costs related to our spin off  without which operating cash flow would have been million 
the decline in operating cash flow in from is a direct result of our change in business model in the first quarter of to offer subscription pricing for the majority of our products 
the decrease in cash used in operations between and results from the continued success of the change in business model and the significant growth in the percentage of our revenue which is recurring in nature  operating savings accomplished through successful integration of the completed acquisitions in each of the three years  and increased customer deposits and deferred revenue from the growth of our business 
in addition  cash flow has been assisted by the new business model and the increasing number of recurring transactions that are paid by credit card or automatic bank draft and also from continued improvement in our accounts receivable collection effort  as evidenced by the significant decrease in day s sales outstanding from in and in to in for each of the three years ended the majority of our cash used for investing has been for acquisitions 
the remainder of our investing activities has consisted of capital expenditures for equipment  software development costs and other intangibles 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of million in related to property and equipment and million capitalized software and we plan to fund these additions from operating cash flows 
in the first quarter of we completed a small acquisition and funded the purchase price of approximately million from our current cash balance 
during our financing activities have consisted of the sale of our common stock and preferred stock the proceeds of which were used to fund our acquisitions and operations 
during and our financing activities represent borrowings attributed to us and cash advances from vitalworks to complete acquisitions attributed to us in the spin off and to retire previously outstanding debt that was attributed to us 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a credit facility with finova capital corporation finova under which we incurred approximately million of indebtedness to repay vitalworks long term indebtedness relating to our business 
the finova credit facility contains restrictions and covenants  including limitations on our leverage  a minimum net worth requirement  a minimum current ratio requirement and a minimum liquidity requirement 
management believes that the covenants that have the greatest likelihood of potentially restricting our operations are quarterly tests for minimum net worth and minimum liquidity 
minimum net worth has been defined to include our convertible redeemable preferred stock 
the minimum net worth requirement was approximately million for the quarter ended december  and future requirements range from a low of approximately million for the quarter ending march   to a high of approximately million for the quarter ending june  minimum liquidity has been defined as cash and cash equivalents  plus million assumed available under our previously outstanding equity line discussed below 
the minimum liquidity requirement was approximately million for the quarter ended december  and future requirements range from a low of approximately million for the quarter ending march  to a high of approximately million for the quarter ending june  the levels for the quarterly tests for minimum net worth and liquidity have been computed based on discussions with the lender regarding our business plan 
the credit facility prohibits payment of cash dividends on  or redemption of  our capital stock 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate which  through december   was a margin equal to plus a base rate equal to the higher of the prime rate as announced from time to time by citibank na and a weighted average of the rates on overnight federal fund transactions plus basis points 
at december   the base rate was 
subsequent to january   the margin increased to 
during the fourth quarter of  finova agreed to defer the scheduled principal payments that were originally due during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of principal payments of per quarter commence in the second quarter of  and the remaining outstanding balance under the facility will be due in full on june  we were in compliance with all of the loan covenants at december  in connection with the spin off  on march   we entered into an equity line agreement with crescent international ltd 
crescent allowing us to issue and sell  and requiring crescent to purchase  upon our request  shares of our common stock for consideration of up to million minus applicable fees and expenses 
however  in no event could we have required crescent to purchase more than million at one time 
this agreement was cancelled in december  as management believes it will have sufficient cash from operations or other viable alternatives to meet its needs as discussed below 
our minimum liquidity covenant now excludes the previously assumed million availability 
in connection with the spin off  on march   we issued  shares of our series c convertible redeemable preferred stock for million less transaction costs to crescent in a private placement 
the series c convertible redeemable preferred stock that has a liquidation preference of million is not redeemable for one year after issuance 
thereafter  the holders can convert all or a portion of the shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock based on a floating conversion price that is a function of our common stock s closing price or approximately  shares at december  
in no event will the holders of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock be entitled to obtain  in the aggregate for all conversions  more than of our common stock upon conversion 
we will have the right to either redeem in cash at a premium or require the conversion of the shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock  provided certain conditions are met 
the redemption premiums will increase proportionately each year from of the liquidation preference during the first year after issuance of the preferred stock to of the liquidation preference following the fourth anniversary year of issuance 
if the series c convertible redeemable preferred stock has not been converted after four years  the holders may require us to redeem the shares at of the liquidation preference which  after the holder s conversion of  shares on march   is million 
if the price of our common stock decreases  we may be required to redeem the shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock at a significant premium in order to prevent a dilutive conversion of the series c convertible redeemable preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
we may not have the necessary funds to redeem any shares of the series c convertible redeemable preferred stock or be permitted to do so under the finova credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition of infosoft  we issued  shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock 
these preferred shares have a stated redemption value of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends  a liquidation preference of million  accrue dividends at an annual rate of  are convertible into practiceworks common stock at a conversion price of or approximately million shares  at december  and are redeemable after five years if not converted 
in addition  the holders of the shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock may require the redemption in cash of their shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock at any time following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
we may not have the necessary funds to redeem any such shares of our convertible redeemable preferred stock or be permitted to do so under the finova credit facility 
on august   we issued shares of our series b convertible redeemable preferred stock to the stockholders of medical dynamics as part of the merger consideration 
these preferred shares have an initial liquidation preference of million  accrue dividends at an annual rate of and are convertible into our common stock at the then applicable conversion price or approximately  shares at december  
if declared  dividends are payable quarterly in arrears at the company s option  in cash or common stock 
if not declared  dividends accrue to the conversion price 
these preferred shares are redeemable at the option of the holder after five years 
the redemption price of the series b convertible redeemable preferred stock will be equal to million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in december  we completed the private placement of approximately  shares of our common stock to institutional investors  certain directors of the company and crescent 
proceeds to the company totaled approximately million and will be used to fund the restructuring plan and for general corporate operating purposes 
assuming our preferred stock issuances are not converted  our future contractual cash obligations  excluding interest and dividends  are as follows in thousands finova   other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases      preferred stock  a  total      a gives effect to the conversion of  shares of series c preferred stock in march we believe that cumulative cash flow from operations and future financing opportunities will provide sufficient cash flow to meet any contractual cash and redemption obligations 
we intend to seek refinancing for any amounts that we are unable to repay from operating cash flows 
new financing alternatives are routinely evaluated to determine their practicality and availability in order to provide the company with sufficient and timely funding at the least possible costs 
however  if refinancing is not available or available on favorable terms  we may not be able to increase our marketing and sales expenses and grow our businesses or effectively compete in any of our markets  which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated future operating cash flow and access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements needs for working capital  capital investment  acquisition and other financing requirements both in the short term  which means the next twelve months  and in the long term  which means a reasonable period of time thereafter
