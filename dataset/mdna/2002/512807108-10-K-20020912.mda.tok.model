item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations lam research corporation is a leading supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications  cmp and post cmp wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns 
over the past three business cycles  the severity of the semiconductor business cycle has increased 
demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors  customer capacity requirements  and our ability to develop and market competitive new products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal   and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
total revenue our total revenues were million   million and  million for fiscal year   and  respectively 
total revenue of  million in fiscal reflected the adoption of sab as of the beginning of that year 
the decrease in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began to see signs of a downturn 
excess inventory of telecommunication products  diminished personal computer sales and a slowing economy caused semiconductor companies to sharply reduce capital expenditures and delay or cancel equipment orders 
these order reductions had a negative impact on the level of our systems shipments starting in the june quarter 
revenues decreased across nearly all product lines in fiscal while the overall industry slowed  our customers continued to make selective purchases to support development of processes needed for smaller device feature sizes and for copper and new materials integration  as well as the transition to mm size wafers 
revenue in fiscal and fiscal reflected a period of expansion in our served markets driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for increased capacity 
in addition  our customers were transitioning to smaller geometries and new materials such as copper 
proportionally  more of our revenue growth can be attributed to our etch family of products 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective june   based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
refer to our discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information about our revenue recognition policy 
based on the guidance provided by sab  we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation 
systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment 
regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows year ended june  june  june  north america europe asia pacific japan a modest recovery in demand for wafer fabrication equipment during the last half of fiscal supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter   compared to the prior quarter  as current manufacturing activity by our customers has improved 
gross margin gross margin was million  million and million in fiscal year   and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross margins were  and in fiscal year   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal stems from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes 
additionally inventory write downs of approximately million and a patent litigation settlement charge of million  in the second fiscal quarter of  and inventory related net restructuring charges  after recoveries  of million unfavorably impacted gross margins in fiscal the decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in the second half of fiscal  due to the industry slowdown 
during the last quarter of fiscal  we experienced a favorable gross margin progression due to better capacity utilization of both our factory and field service resources and from the impact of cost reduction programs 
excluding restructuring reserve recovery  gross margin for the june quarter was of total revenue  compared to of total revenue in the march quarter 
our current outlook is for gross margin as a percent of revenue to rise sequentially in the first fiscal quarter   due to higher revenues and increased production efficiencies 
research and development r d expenses were million  million and million in fiscal year   and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenue  r d expenses were  and for fiscal year  and  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of lower sales volume 
the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal results from controlled spending on general r d programs  consistent with the downturn in the business cycle 
the increase in r d expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by expanded levels of investment in advanced etch and cmp clean applications  including developing the technology necessary to support smaller geometries  new insulating materials  copper based devices and mm size wafers 
we believe that in order to remain competitive  we must continue to invest substantially in r d 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs 
we expect to continue making sizeable investments in advanced etch and cmp clean applications and in enhancing our existing products during fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses excluding restructuring charges recoveries were million  million and million in fiscal year   and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses excluding restructuring charges recoveries were  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal is largely due to manpower reductions  lower incentive payments to employees  shutdown days and other cost reduction programs 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  is primarily the result of lower sales volume 
the increase in absolute dollars for fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by infrastructure expansion needed to sustain higher sales  marketing  and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal sg a increased as a percent of revenue in fiscal  largely due to the decline in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring charges we have developed restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities including downsizing and reorganizations and business exit activities related to discontinued product lines 
accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan  the nature of our extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a restructuring event does not necessarily exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
in april  we announced plans to reduce our global workforce up to during the fourth quarter of fiscal the june plan 
the reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level of decline in our revenues due to the forecasted contraction of our served market from calendar year levels 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the june plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan 
we began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately prior to june  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities  and charges for inventories of an etch product line that has been discontinued 
in addition  we consolidated our fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote off the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also recovered million from certain of our etch product line inventory  previously segregated and written off 
below is a table summarizing activity relating to the june plan lease severance payments abandoned other and on vacated fixed discontinued exit benefits facilities assets inventory costs total in thousands fiscal year provision     cash payments  non cash charges   balance at june    recovery of assets cash payments  non cash charges reversal of restructuring charge

prior to the date of the financial statements  management  with the proper level of authority  approved and committed to the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit 
the termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced 
the majority of the severance and benefits reserve balance of million as of june  is anticipated to be utilized by december lease payments on vacated facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements 
we estimated  given the prevailing real estate market conditions  that it would take approximately months to sub lease our vacated buildings in fremont  california 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
we wrote off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately million  as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned 
in addition  certain demonstration equipment and etch product line inventory were abandoned and written off 
other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated with capital improvements to the vacated facilities 
our business outlook in mid to late summer of  indicated further deterioration in semiconductor sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a lower outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our revenues 
consequently  in august  we announced a new plan the september plan to further reduce our fixed cost infrastructure  including an approximate reduction in force 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the september plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan 
we began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduced our workforce by approximately employees  worldwide prior to september  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  write offs for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities  and charges for inventories of selected  older etch product lines that were discontinued 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal we also recovered million from certain of our older etch inventories  previously segregated and written off and million from facilities leases

the termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced 
the majority of the severance and benefits reserve balance of million as of june  is anticipated to be utilized by december lease payments on vacated facilities relates to months of rent or the remainder of the lease term  if less after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements 
we estimated  given prevailing real estate market conditions  that it would take approximately months to sublease the vacated facilities in fremont  california 
we wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately million  as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned 
additionally  we exited selected  older etch product lines and wrote off the related discontinued manufacturing inventory 
the continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year and its impact on our near term financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan the december plan 
in december  we publicly announced our intention to reduce global employment by approximately and further consolidate our facilities 
during the second fiscal quarter  the december plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan 
we began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduction of our workforce by approximately employees  worldwide prior to december  we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
below is a table summarizing activity relating to the december plan lease severance payments abandoned and on vacated fixed benefits facilities assets total in thousands fiscal year provision     cash payments   non cash charges    balance at june     severance and benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated employees

we wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately million  as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned 
additionally  certain fixed assets of approximately million associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and written off 
as summarized above  restructuring activities have had a significant impact on our operating results 
as discussed under recent accounting pronouncements below  the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
had fas been applicable when we undertook our restructuring activities  the timing and amount of the charges recognized may have been different than those reported 
fas is applicable to restructuring activities initiated on or after december  with early adoption encouraged 
fas does not apply to our previous restructuring activities 
asset impairment charges during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment to be disposed of exceeded its fair value less cost to sell 
fair value was assessed using the market values of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment 
impairment occurred due to rapid technological changes brought about by the semiconductor industry s move to copper and mm applications 
in accordance with fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million 
a million write down to fair value of certain laboratory tools is included in r d expenses and million of write downs to fair value of demonstration equipment are included in sg a expenses 
remaining equipment with carrying values totaling million is reviewed quarterly for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next months 
patent litigation settlement on december   we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october under the terms of the settlement agreement  varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash million in december and the balance of million to be paid quarterly over the next years and issued a warrant with a fair value of million that entitled varian to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as part of the full and final settlement  varian and lam agreed to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims relating to the litigation 
in connection with the settlement  we recorded a charge of million in the quarter ended december   which represents approximately of the total value of the settlement 
the remaining portion of the total value of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents  million  is being amortized ratably over quarters 
the imputed value of the warrant was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the key assumptions used in the valuation model were an expected life of years  anticipated stock price volatility of and a risk free interest rate of 
purchased technology for research development during the second quarter of fiscal  we made an equity investment in  and purchased a portfolio of cmp intellectual property rights and research and development technology from strasbaugh 
we recognized a one time charge to income of million for the purchase of in process research and development technology and recorded a million investment in preferred stock and intangible assets 
our equity interest in strasbaugh  representing approximately of strasbaugh s total capital stock  is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five years 
based on our analysis of strasbaugh s current and expected financial performance  we determined in the third quarter of fiscal that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other than temporary impairment and recorded a million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value 
our equity in the income loss from strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
the income loss has not been material  and  therefore  has not been itemized in other income  net  on the accompanying statements of operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor equipment industry from oliver design  inc oliver 
we recognized an expense for the purchase of research and development technology of approximately million and capitalized million related to acquired patents  which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years 
the technology is being used in a next generation product development project and has no future alternative use 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  was million  million and million in fiscal year   and  respectively 
the increase in net other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates in fiscal  the non taxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to lam stock  and the decrease in foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by higher interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we applied emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 in accounting for our equity derivatives indexed to our own stock 
in accordance with eitf  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset 
the cumulative change was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement  if any  will be non taxable 
we adjust the carrying value of these derivative instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period  with the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or lose in our statement of operations 
for additional information about our accounting for these equity derivatives  refer to our discussion of investments in derivative financial instruments indexed to lam research corporation stock  included in critical accounting polices in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
based on a june  stock price of  the fair value of the equity derivatives was million  which resulted in a non taxable loss of million for fiscal tax expense benefit our effective annual income tax rate was  excluding the loss on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal year  and and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the cumulative loss from the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock is non taxable 
the fiscal year rate reflected the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior periods 
during the first quarter of fiscal  income tax benefit was recorded using a tax rate estimate  income tax benefit in subsequent fiscal quarters was recorded using a tax benefit rate estimate 
the increase in the tax benefit rate results from the tax benefit of the r d credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and our continued and substantial investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for r d tax benefits 
deferred tax assets we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards of million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of million  million and million and deferred tax liabilities of million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and we believe that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted profitability 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
outsourcing we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these capabilities 
we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products  to market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly with our customers  what we sell 
most other activities in the company are in support of product development  marketing and selling and customer service 
consequently  over the last months  we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties 
accordingly  during fiscal  we entered into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  facilities management and information technology functions 
we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs may provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down  in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to requirements generated by the cyclical nature of our business 
implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business 
related party transactions during fiscal year  our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to million dollars at simple interest 
at june   the entire principal amount  million  and accrued interest was outstanding 
the loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable  in full  together with accrued interest  at any time  but no later than may  subsequent events the convertible subordinated notes  notes  matured on september  and were repaid in full 
this resulted in a cash outlay of approximately million 
at the end of august  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock with a market value of million per share by physically settling certain put and call option contracts equity derivative contracts  which gave us the right to repurchase the shares for million per share from independent third parties 
by settling the equity derivative contracts  we were able to repurchase the shares at a discount of million per share from their fair market value 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized an increase in treasury stock of million 
from june  through the settlement date  the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by million to million as a result of changes in the fair value of our common stock over the same period 
this reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value will be included in our earnings for the quarter ending september  critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first 
in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition  the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision  we will recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications 
revenue related to spare parts sales  system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective june   based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to fiscal year  the company s revenue recognition policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment 
as a result of our change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the cumulative effect of the change on our financial statements  the deferred revenue balance upon adopton of sab  as of june   was million  consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of june  of this amount  we recognized revenue of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
at june   the deferred revenue balance  including million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment  was approximately million 
investments in derivative financial instruments indexed to lam research corporation stock in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf issue no 
 determination of whether share settlement is within the control of the issuer  for the purposes of applying eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
eitf addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock equity derivatives by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity  temporary equity and assets and liabilities 
under eitf  equity derivatives that were issued prior to september   and classified as permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be re classified as assets or liabilities 
to qualify as permanent equity  all the following criteria must be met the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares  the company must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract  the contract must contain an explicit limit on the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement  there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral  there can be no make whole provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder 
equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value  and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contract classification occurs 
equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations 
lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to our own stock 
application of eitf requires these instruments be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period  the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or loss on our statement of operations 
our equity derivatives are collateralized by restricted cash of million and may not be settled in unregistered shares 
in accordance with eitf  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of these put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset 
the june  cumulative effect adjustment  a gain of million per diluted share  was based on a june  stock price of 
the cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement will be non taxable 
based on a june   stock price of  the million fair value of the equity derivatives resulted in a non taxable loss of million for the year ended june  the loss is recorded in other income expense in the june condensed consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the options is recorded in other current assets 
see subsequent events included herein item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information concerning the settlement of our equity derivatives 
refer to item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about our investments in equity derivative financial instruments 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market using standard costs  which approximate actual cost 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers  we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products 
standard costs are generally re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs  generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead for manufactured products 
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to fully absorb spending at average utilization volumes 
all intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
the assembly outsourcing initiative has and will continue to alter the composition of reported cost of sales 
over time  proportionately more costs will comprise purchased materials and less will represent manufacturing labor and overhead  reflecting the substitution of our assembly activities with the purchase of completed modules and integrated units from new outsource assembly vendors 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirements over the next to months based on estimated customer product orders is written down to its estimated market value  if less than cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  general semiconductor market conditions  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
installation and warranty typically  part of marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes installing and providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we generally record actual labor and material expenses for installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue recognition 
we also provide a contractual performance warranty on our systems  the period of which runs concurrent with the system installation process  generally months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer 
we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system  customer  and geographic region  modified for any known differences such as a new  simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements 
where customer and system specific installation and warranty reserves are established  all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 
actual warranty expenses incurred on a system by system basis  and overall  may differ from our original estimates 
while we consistently monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
accordingly  actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time  additional probable and estimable liabilities recorded 
we do not maintain general or unspecified provisions or reserves  all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 
historically  including the most recent months ended june  all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  the company provides customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services  with a term of more than one month  are recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
at june   warranty reserves were million  compared to million at june  employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option plans we account for our stock purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and make pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  were followed 
our employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option 
because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future estimated taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our current valuation allowance covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options 
when these tax benefits are realized  the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value 
recent accounting pronouncements impairment or disposals of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas supersedes fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations 
we are required to adopt fas at the beginning of fiscal fas is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between fas and eitf relates to fas s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
fas is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations 
consolidation of certain special purpose entities in june  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements consolidation of certain special purpose entities the proposed interpretation or exposure draft that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of special purpose entities spe 
the proposed interpretation will apply to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with an spe 
the exposure draft provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a spe  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the proposed interpretation may result in our having to consolidate the operating results of a spe or similar entity  which is a lessor under one of our operating lease agreements 
the fasb expects to issue the interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year the effective date of these proposed new rules on our current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending june  and sooner on any new leases entered into after the new rules effective date which utilize spes or equivalent lease structures 
implementation of this exposure draft  when and if it becomes a final accounting rule  could require us to consolidate the activities of the spe and recognize the asset and related liability 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in may  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation that would require a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the proposed interpretation would also require a company the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the proposed interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent measurement of the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the proposed interpretaton would also incorporate  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others which is being superseded 
implementation of this exposure draft  when and if it becomes a final accounting rule would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  and would be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the proposed interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash compared with million at june  subsequent event the notes  principal amount of million  matured on september   and were redeemed in cash 
the proceeds we used to redeem the notes came primarily from short term investments that had matured subsequent to june  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal net loss for the year of million adjusted for non cash charges of million  resulted in positive cash flow of million  which was partially offset by uses of working capital totaling million 
non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization  patent litigation settlement  restructuring charges  deferred income taxes  impairment charges and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in company stock 
significant changes in current assets and liabilities resulted from improved accounts receivable turnover and the continued use of programs to selectively sell accounts receivables  which resulted in a million improvement 
additionally  highly controlled purchasing processes combined with lower shipments and inventory write downs for excess  obsolete  and older generation products reduced inventory by approximately million 
accrued liabilities declined by million due to reduced compensation and warranty liabilities 
deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell million  in line with equipment delivery trends 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  down from million in significant uses of cash in fiscal included net purchases of short term investments of million and limited capital expenditure projects of million 
additionally  restricted cash increased million  mostly due to collateral requirements of our interest rate swap agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated million 
we repurchased million of common stock and reissued million of treasury stock through the employee stock purchase program 
principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations were million 
property and equipment was million at june   compared to million at june  the decrease in property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to minimum expenditures for capital projects during fiscal  write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities  and impairments of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment 
at june   our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt retirements  lease payments  other long term liabilities  and outsourced functions are as follow debt and other outsourcing long term operating and consignment liabilities leases contracts in thousands through june     through    and thereafter  total    the notes  principal amount of million  mature on september  and are included in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet as of june  debt financing includes two convertible subordinated notes and a yen denominated term loan 
details of the convertible notes are description convertible subordinated notes  notes convertible subordinated notes  notes offering date may august offering amount million million maturity date june  september  offering expenses million incurred at the time of offering  ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the notes 
remaining unamortized balance of million and million at june  and june   respectively 
million incurred at the time of offering ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the notes 
remaining unamortized balance of million and million at june  and june   respectively 
interest rate terms payable on june and december of each year  commencing december payable on september and march of each year  commencing march conversion rights convertible into lam common stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share subject to anti dilution adjustments convertible into lam common stock at any time prior to close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share subject to anti dilution adjustments redemption terms redeemable at lam option  beginning june  with at least days and no more than days notice  at redemption prices starting at and at diminishing prices thereafter  plus accrued interest 
redeemable at lam option  beginning september  with at least days notice  at redemption prices starting at and at diminishing prices thereafter  plus accrued interest  if the closing price of lam common stock is at least of the conversion price for at least trading days ending within a period of consecutive trading days ending within trading days prior to the notice of redemption security notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a three year yen denominated term loan for approximately billion million at june  with a syndicate of financial institutions  in order to fund our japanese subsidiary operations 
the entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity  june   and has a floating interest rate based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor  which at june   was per annum 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the company s notes  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the transaction swapped fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the london interbank offered rate libor based interest rate  resulting in interest expense savings of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  should month libor interest rates rise above approximately per annum in future periods  incremental interest expense to the company may be incurred 
under the terms of the transaction  we must provide collateral to match any mark to market exposure on the swap 
the amount of collateral required totals a minimum of million plus an amount equal to the mark to market exposure on the swap 
therefore  the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark to market exposure on the swap instrument 
generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise 
at the end of fiscal we have million in restricted cash on our balance sheet classified as a long term asset related to this transaction 
the swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions of fas this discussion should be read in conjunction with note e of our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
on december   we signed a final settlement agreement with varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october under the terms of the settlement agreement  varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash million in december and the balance of million to be paid quarterly over the next years 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above includes our cash obligations at june   related to the varian settlement 
we lease most of our administrative  r d and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through generally  all of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont  california headquarters and certain operating leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods 
certain of our other facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 
lease agreements relating to certain buildings at our fremont  california campus  require us to provide guaranteed residual values totaling million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in the preceding table million in  million in and million in 
the lessor associated with one of these lease agreements is a spe or equivalent structure 
presently  we account for this lease as an operating lease while the spe owns and accounts for the leased assets and related liabilities 
the fasb has issued an exposure draft consolidation of certain special purpose entites  a proposed interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of spes 
implementation of this exposure draft  when and if it becomes a final accounting rule  could require us to consolidate the activities of the spe and recognize the asset and related liability 
additionally  one of our lease agreements includes collateral restrictions that require us to maintain a certain amount of cash  million at june   in restricted specified interest bearing accounts 
these restricted cash accounts must be maintained through march unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of required cash collateral is reduced  as the underlying obligation is paid down by the lessor 
during the second half of fiscal  we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities maintenance and information technology functions 
these outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum outsourcing obligations at june  under these arrangements 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the assumption of leases  assets and employees 
consignment inventories  which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses  are not reported as inventory until title is transferred or our purchase obligation is determined 
at june   vendor owned inventories held at lam and not reported as inventory were approximately million 
in fiscal  we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties the third parties for the purchase and sale of our common stock 
our board of directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties options to purchase up to million shares of our common stock 
these call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into common stock of the convertible subordinated notes previously issued by us  and which became due september  as part of the program  the board of directors also authorized us to enter into the sale of put options with the same third parties covering up to million shares of our common stock 
we anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call options from those same third parties 
pursuant to the authorization described above  as of june   we have acquired call options to purchase million shares of our common stock  the weighted average exercise price of these options is 
the call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is per option share the difference between  which is the conversion price of the notes issued in august  and the weighted average exercise price of the call options 
we also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering million shares of our common stock  giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
on june   all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired 
as of june   we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering million shares of our common stock  giving the third party the right to sell to us shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
the call and put options are european style options exercisable upon expiration  all of the options expire no later than september   which is the business day following the date on which the notes must either be converted or retired 
upon option exercise  we have the ability  at our discretion  to permit the options to be physically settled ie  shares would be delivered to us against payment of the exercise price  settled in cash ie  by a payment from one party to the other of the value of the option being exercised or net settled in shares ie  by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised 
certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counter party to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments 
we can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate third party 
while the options are only exercisable at expiration  the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain events in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares  including without limitation our material breach of the agreement  default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition  reduction in our s p credit rating below b or a drop in the price of our common stock to less than per share 
we account for these derivative financial instruments  indexed and potentially settled in our stock  under the provisions of eitf at june   the instruments had a net fair value of million and are included in other current assets 
if the average stock price is below during any period  the required number of shares to net settle the company s obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share eps calculation 
see subsequent events included herein item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information concerning the repayment of our notes that matured september  and the settlement of our equity derivatives 
given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  we believe that maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in r d and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles 
based upon our current business outlook  our levels of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june   combined with cash conservation activities  are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations  investments  capital expenditures  settlement in cash of our notes which matured on september  and settlement of equity derivative contracts through at least the end of calendar year in the longer term  liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues  and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products 
risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally  and the equipment industry specifically  the extent that customers use our products and services in their business  customer acceptances of equipment  the size and timing of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays in our shipments  installations and or acceptances  our ability in a timely manner to develop  introduce and market new  enhanced and competitive products  our competitors introduction of new products  legal or technical challenges to our products and technology  new or modified accounting regulations  changes in average selling prices and product mix  exchange rate fluctuations  and exposure on interest rate swap agreements 
we manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we derive our revenue primarily from the shipment and acceptance of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
our systems can range in price from approximately  to million per unit 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenues  and a high percentage of those expenses are relatively fixed  a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter 
our operating results for a quarter may suffer substantially if we ship fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter  our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments  we do not receive anticipated purchase orders in time to enable shipment or acceptance of equipment during a given quarter  one or more customers delays or cancels anticipated shipments and or installations  shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing or transportation difficulties  or our suppliers or outsource vendors fail to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations 
further  because most of our manufacturing and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont  california facility  natural  physical  logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility including labor disruptions  earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 
variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results in december  the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments 
prior to sab  we generally recognized new systems revenue on the date the equipment was shipped to customers 
under sab  we now generally recognize revenue for new equipment on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns 
in late fiscal  increased demand for our products drove revenue growth throughout fiscal and early fiscal in the later part of the december quarter  we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were considering reductions in equipment purchases during the first half of calendar year these signs were confirmed in calendar year  as semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity 
the resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility are expected to continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments  revenues and operating results 
we will continue to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at alignment of our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams  which sometimes result in restructuring charges 
even during periods of reduced revenues  we must continue to invest in product research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
we depend on new products and processes for our success 
for this reason  we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop  manufacture  and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products 
due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products  we strive to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully  or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace  which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry 
we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
future technologies  processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete  leaving us with non competitive products  or obsolete inventory  or both 
we may be unable in a timely manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
in addition  in connection with the development of new products  we will invest in pilot production inventory 
our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence  which would adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to risks associated with the introduction of new products we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products  which may affect our ability to sell our products 
furthermore  our own introduction of new products represents significant investments of our resources and their success  or lack thereof  could have a material effect on our financial results 
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products  and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in demand for our products  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
generally  each of our key suppliers has a one year blanket purchase contract under which we may issue purchase orders 
we may renew these contracts periodically 
each of these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years  and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers 
several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to lam  where practical our intent is to establish alternative sources 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products  lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 
our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect we are expanding the role that outsource providers play in our business 
we anticipate that these outsource providers will play keys roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions 
although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts  it is possible that one or more of these providers will fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the expanded role of outsource providers will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers 
any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results 
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor s equipment  making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier s processing equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application 
accordingly  we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s equipment 
we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide  and to invest in product and process research and development 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry 
in addition  there are smaller  emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently  or expect to  offer 
we anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics 
if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop  it could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 
in addition  competitors with higher levels of financial resources than we have may deeply discount or give away products similar to those we sell 
for these reasons  we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
in particular  while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements  we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully  or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive 
accordingly  we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets  competition may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results  financial condition  and or cash flows 
our future success depends on international sales non us sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 
international sales are subject to risks  including  but not limited to foreign exchange risks  changing import export requirements  foreign trade disputes  and economic  political  banking and currency problems in the relevant region 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on yen denominated sales and assets  and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future 
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products 
these regulations could require us to alter our current operations  to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
our failure to control the use  sale  transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 
our ability to manage potential growth or decline  integration of potential acquisitions and potential disposition of product lines and technologies creates risks for us current conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry challenges our management to control spending on operating activities 
if we experience rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services  we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls  management processes  information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training  managing and appropriately sizing our work force 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to perform such actions successfully 
in the future  we may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies  which no longer fit our long term strategies 
managing an acquired business  disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others 
our success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth  decline  integration of potential acquisitions  disposition of product lines or technologies  or reduction in personnel or that our management  personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations 
any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products  augment our market coverage and distribution ability  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  the amortization of related intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  and or the price of our common stock 
the market for our common stock is extremely volatile  which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years 
the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors  including but not limited to the following general market  semiconductor  or semiconductor equipment industry conditions  global economic fluctuations  variations in our quarterly operating results  variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast  announcements of restructurings  technological innovations  reductions in force  departure of key employees  consolidations of operations or introduction of new products  government regulations  developments in  or claims relating to  patent or other proprietary rights  disruptions with key customers or suppliers  or political  economic or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions 
in addition  the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
recent volatility in the price of our common stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors 
these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following volatile periods in the price of stock  many companies become the object of securities class action litigation 
if we are sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs  and it could divert management s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 
risk associated with our interest rate swap agreement we aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations 
to minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our notes  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
we entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our notes  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate  by swapping fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the libor based interest rate 
if month libor based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings 
however  a rise in month libor based interest rates above approximately per annum in future periods could result in incremental levels of interest expense 
the potential anti takeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders in  we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock  held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january   and thereafter 
in connection with the adoption of the rights plan  our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws  including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals 
our rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers 
the rights plan  however  is not intended to prevent a takeover 
rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine  which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam 
the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including causing the loss of voting control 
moreover  section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders  as defined by that statute 
intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement  unfair competition or other claims against us 
additionally  from time to time  other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  our bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers  directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam 
in such cases  it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
however  we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
in september  tegal corporation sued us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents tegal holds 
specifically  tegal identified our xle and exelan products as infringing the patents tegal is asserting 
litigation is inherently uncertain  and we may fail to prevail in this litigation 
however  we believe that the tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial position 
see part i item of this form k for a discussion of the tegal lawsuit 
we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights  which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secret protection  we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise  continuing our development of new systems  increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base  and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers 
however  we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances  or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently 
we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications 
however  other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications 
in addition  the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations at june   and june  june  june  th ere fair af ter total value total in thousand s cash equivalents fixed rate  average rate short term investments fixed rate   average rate auction rate preferreds variable rate  average rate restricted cash fixed rate   average rate total investment securities   average rate long term debt fixed rate   average rate variable rate  average rate total long term debt    average rate we mitigate default risk by targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
we have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate million and million convertible subordinated notes 
however  we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our billion million at june  yen denominated bank term loan because the lending rates under that term loan vary with tibor 
we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for this reason  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our yen denominated assets 
the changes in the fair value of these contracts are adjusted to fair value and recorded in other income and expense 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was million 
the unrealized loss on the contracts on june   was million
