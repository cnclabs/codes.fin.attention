same store sales for averaged  per week on a base of restaurants  representing an increase of over the method of computing same stores sales based on including restaurants open for more than months was adopted effective with the third quarter of under the previous method of reporting same store sales  which was based on restaurants open for more than months  the weekly same store sales average decreased by 
in and remained the same in compared to the respective prior years 
management estimates the average check per guest  excluding alcoholic beverage sales  was for  representing a decrease of approximately compared to menu prices for increased an estimated compared to management estimates that the average check per guest in totaled  representing an increase of approximately over menu prices for increased by an estimated compared to the company estimates that customer traffic guest counts on a same store basis for was equal to levels achieved in and decreased by approximately in compared to management believes that increases in check averages resulting from certain menu changes made in late proved to be excessive for the size and economic characteristics of its small and mid market locations those with less than million people and contributed to guest count declines experienced by the company during the last three quarters of beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company revised its menus and feature programs in certain of the restaurants in these markets in order to reduce the guest check average and improve customer traffic trends 
as noted above  both of these objectives were accomplished during and the company reported positive same store sales results for both the third and fourth quarters of management implemented modest price increases during august and october of on selected menu items in an effort to improve sales and profitability 
these changes positively impacted sales performance during the last half of and same store sales for the first two months of continue to show improvement when compared to the corresponding periods of however  customer traffic on a same store basis has decreased during the first two months of by approximately compared to the corresponding periods of management anticipates that  through menu management and continued emphasis on providing professional service  these trends will be reversed during the last half of restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  have been relatively consistent during the past three years  totaling for  for and for restaurant operating margins totaled in  in and in the most variable component of restaurant operating expenses during these years was cost of sales  which as a percentage of sales totaled  and during  and  respectively 
the increase during related primarily to a significant increase in the company s cost of beef  a commodity that is contracted for annually and which comprises approximately of the company s cost of sales 
the increased cost of beef more than offset the benefit of the nominal menu price increases noted above during the decrease in cost of sales during resulted from management s continued emphasis on increased efficiencies in this area and the menu price increases which were implemented during the year  as noted above 
management believes that continuing to increase sales volumes in the company s restaurants is a significant factor in improving the company s profitability and intends to maintain a low new restaurant development rate of one to two new restaurants per year to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants while maintaining its pursuit of operational excellence 
further  the company s criteria for new restaurant development target locations with high population densities and high household incomes which management believes provide the best prospects for achieving outstanding financial returns on the company s investments in new restaurants 
the company has executed a new beef contract with more favorable pricing which became effective in march management believes that the impact of the new beef prices  modest menu price increases and other cost control and reduction measures should more than offset increases in in certain other restaurant costs and expenses  including increases in insurance premiums 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include supervisory costs as well as management training costs and all other costs above the restaurant level  totaled  in   in and  in decreases in management training and relocation costs  which comprise approximately to of total general and administrative expenses  and certain other employee benefit related expenses allowed the company to maintain total general and administrative expenses for at the prior year level by partially offsetting increases in other expenses related to the growth of the company 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in due to the small decrease in expenditures and the higher sales levels achieved 
general and administrative expenses increased only slightly in compared to however  as a percentage of sales  these expenses decreased to in from in decreases in management training  relocation and procurement costs and certain other employee benefit related expenses contributed to the modest increase in total general and administrative expenses for by partially offsetting increases in other expenses related to the growth of the company 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for are expected to increase slightly as compared to pre opening expense because the company expenses all pre opening costs as incurred  pre opening expenses were higher in  when two restaurants were opened  than in and  when only one restaurant was opened in each year 
other income and expense net interest expense decreased by  during compared to and increased only slightly in compared to the reduction in was primarily due to favorable interest rates on balances outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit 
other  net expense of  for   for and  for was the result of expenses associated with the retirement of facilities and equipment replaced in connection with various capital maintenance projects which more than offset miscellaneous income categories 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at december  relate primarily to  of tax credit carryforwards and  of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
the recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not likely to be generated in such amounts 
due to the losses incurred in through and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management has been unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets will be realized and has maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  since the provision for income taxes for and results from federal alternative minimum tax amt and state income taxes payable 
in  the company was able to reduce its amt liability by the use of amt net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards were all utilized in  however  and were not available for and the effective tax rate of for is significantly higher than the federal statutory rate because the amt rate is applied to the company s pre tax accounting income after adding back certain tax preference items as well as certain permanent differences and timing differences in book and tax income 
because the company maintains a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  no benefit is recognized in the current year s income tax provision with respect to the amt credit carryforward or other tax assets generated for the year 
further  because of the application of amt  the company at its current taxable income level is unable to take advantage of the sizable tax carryforwards which it has accumulated 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital for the past three years has been for the development and maintenance of its j 
alexander s restaurants 
in addition  the company has an annual sinking fund requirement  due on june   in connection with its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures and may make purchases of up to  of its common stock under a repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors 
from june through march   the company has repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately  the company has met its capital needs and maintained liquidity primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of its bank line of credit and through other sources discussed below 
capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
cash flow from operations exceeded capital expenditures in and also represented and of capital expenditures for and  respectively 
the remaining capital expenditures along with other needs for the and years were funded by use of the company s line of credit and  for  by the sale of common stock as discussed below 
in  the company plans to construct and open one restaurant 
management estimates that the cost to purchase property for  and build and equip this restaurant and for capital maintenance for existing restaurants will be approximately million for in addition  the company may incur capital expenditures for the purchase of property and or construction of restaurants for locations to be opened in any such expenditures are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites 
while a working capital deficit of  existed as of december   the company does not believe this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company 
certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  thus virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
as of december   debentures in the principal amount of  had been purchased by the company for use toward satisfying the annual sinking fund requirement of  for this issue for in  the company s board of directors established a loan program designed to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
under the program participants were allowed to borrow an amount equal to the full price of common stock purchased 
the plan authorized million in loans to employees 
purchases of stock under the plan totaled  during  with the remainder purchased in the employee loans  which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity  are payable on december   unless repaid sooner pursuant to terms of the plan 
the company maintains a bank line of credit of million which is expected to be used as needed for funding of capital expenditures and to provide liquidity for meeting working capital or other needs 
at december   borrowings outstanding under this line of credit were  the line of credit agreement  which was last amended on august   contains covenants which require the company to achieve specified levels of senior debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and to maintain certain other financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december  and  based on a current assessment of its business  believes it will continue to comply with these covenants during the credit agreement also contains certain limitations on capital expenditures and restaurant development by the company generally limiting the company to the development of two new restaurants per year and restricts the company s ability to incur additional debt outside the bank line of credit 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit is currently based on libor plus a spread of two to three percent  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
this agreement expires on july   but includes an option to convert outstanding borrowings to a term loan prior to that time 
in the event of conversion  the principal would be repaid in equal monthly installments 
because the line of credit is scheduled to mature within six months of december    representing six months principal payments if the total credit line balance were converted to a term loan  has been reflected as a current liability in the december  balance sheet 
while management believes its existing credit facility will be adequate to meet its financing needs during  it is actively evaluating proposals for long term real estate financing and believes that such financing will be available on acceptable terms in an amount sufficient to reduce or fully repay the current line of credit as well as provide for payment of  related to the remaining balance of its convertible debentures 
the company presently intends to obtain such financing  but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so 
interest rates on financing of this nature are expected to be significantly higher than those currently being paid on balances outstanding under the company s line of credit 
if the company is unsuccessful in obtaining long term real estate financing  then it can exercise the option to convert its credit facility to a term loan  as described above 
in march the company developed a plan for raising additional equity capital to further strengthen its financial position and  as part of this plan  completed a private sale of  shares of common stock to solidus  llc  an affiliate of one of the directors of the company  for approximately million 
in addition  on june   the company completed a rights offering wherein shareholders of the company purchased an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share  which was the same price per share as stock sold in the private sale 
the private sale and the rights offering raised total net proceeds to the company of approximately million which were used to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
the company believes that raising additional equity capital and repaying a portion of its outstanding debt benefited the company by reducing its debt to equity ratio and reducing interest expense and that it will provide greater flexibility to the company in providing for future financing needs 
from through  the company operated restaurants in the quick service restaurant industry 
the discontinuation of these quick service restaurant operations included disposals of restaurants that were subject to lease agreements which typically contained initial lease terms of years plus two additional option periods of five years each 
in connection with certain of these dispositions  the company remains secondarily liable for ensuring financial performance as set forth in the original lease agreement 
the company can only estimate its contingent liability relative to these leases  as any changes to the contractual arrangements between the current tenant and the landlord subsequent to the assignment are not required to be disclosed to the company 
a summary of the company s estimated contingent liability is set forth as follows wendy s restaurants leases  mrs 
winner s chicken biscuits restaurants leases  total contingent liability related to assigned leases  there have been no payments by the company of such contingent liabilities in the history of the company 
as of march   the company had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  the company is not a party to any financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note f  leases and note k  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those which involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company had  of gross deferred tax assets at december   consisting principally of  of tax credit carryforwards and  of net operating loss carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will ultimately be realized 
due to losses incurred from through and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of its costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management has been unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets will be realized and has maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  since as a result  the company currently provides for income taxes only to the extent that it expects to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax on current taxable income 
it is possible  however  that the company could generate profits in the future at levels which would cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all or a portion of its various net deferred tax assets 
upon reaching such a conclusion  management would record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause the company s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the various carryforwards was fully utilized 
impairments of long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets most typically assets associated with a specific restaurant might be impaired  management compares the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted cash flows it expects that restaurant to generate over its remaining useful life 
in calculating its estimate of such undiscounted cash flows  management is required to make assumptions relative to the restaurant s future sales performance  cost of sales  labor  operating expenses and occupancy costs  which include property taxes  property and casualty insurance premiums and other similar costs associated with the restaurant s operation 
the resulting forecast of undiscounted cash flows represents management s best estimate based on both historical results and management s expectation of future operations for that particular restaurant 
to date  all of the company s long lived assets have been determined to be recoverable based on management s estimates of future cash flows 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 
business combinations sfas and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   and that the use of the pooling of interest method is no longer allowed 
sfas requires that upon adoption  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
identifiable intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of  including the required impairment tests 
as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill of approximately  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was  for the fiscal year ended december  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on the company s consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas provides a single framework for evaluating long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale and addresses the principal implementation issues 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company will adopt sfas as of december  and does not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s revenues and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
revenues and net income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter due to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season 
in addition  certain of the company s restaurants  particularly those located in south florida  typically experience an increase in customer traffic during the period between thanksgiving and easter due to local residents who live in these markets for only a portion of the year 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre opening costs 
risks associated with forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all references are to fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
the forward looking statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to certain matters involve risks and uncertainties  including anticipated financial performance  business prospects  anticipated capital expenditures  financing arrangements and other similar matters  which reflect management s best judgment based on factors currently known 
actual results and experience could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
forward looking information provided by the company pursuant to the safe harbor established under the private securities litigation reform act of should be evaluated in the context of these factors 
in addition  the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in market interest rates to have a material affect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors 
such commitments generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef  seafood and produce vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
