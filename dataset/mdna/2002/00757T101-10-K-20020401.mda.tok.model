item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates general ans discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon ans consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of our neuromodulation products and custom manufactured oem products at hdi is recognized when the goods are shipped to our customers 
we record  as a reduction in revenue  a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on these product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
we also design and develop products at hdi under fixed price development agreements with third parties 
each development agreement reflects the terms and conditions of the project  including project objectives  product specifications  responsibilities for tasks  licenses and fields of use of intellectual properties  manufacturing rights and compensation to be paid to hdi  amongst other terms and conditions 
a typical development project will take one to two years to complete and is undertaken in accordance with the design controls of the fda s qsr and similar international standards 
we recognize revenue and profit under the development agreements using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a development agreement can be made 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed under a development agreement  then future profit margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
in certain cases  hdi will undertake a development project on a cost plus basis 
in this event  we periodically invoice the customer for actual time and material expended on the project at predetermined hourly billing rates and mark ups 
page bad debt we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of the receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances or write offs may be required 
inventory our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based upon forecasted demand for our products 
if the demand for our products is less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
intangible assets goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and other identifiable intangible assets  such as patents  purchased technology  tradenames and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
warranty obligations our products are generally covered by a one year warranty 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products and business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
currently  product liability claims are the only litigation to which we are a party 
while historically our product liability claims have not resulted in significant monetary liability beyond our insurance coverage  an adverse judgment beyond our insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
overview on november   the fda approved the pre market approval pma application for our genesis ipg 
this approval enables us to commercially market the genesis ipg in the united states  which we formally commenced in january and to participate in of the neurostimulation market to treat chronic pain of the trunk and limbs 
industry analysts estimate that the worldwide ipg market is growing at a annual rate and will approach million in until our launch of the genesis ipg  only one other company marketed an approved ipg device in the united states 
page on january   we acquired the assets primarily intellectual property consisting of patents and know how of implantable devices limited partnership idp and esox technology holdings  llc esox  two privately held minnesota companies  for  shares of ans common stock 
based on the closing price of ans common stock on december   the value of the stock issued to acquire the assets was million 
idp was formed in to commercialize certain implantable infusion technologies developed at the university of minnesota 
we entered a license agreement with idp in to license rights to implantable infusion pump technologies developed by idp and esox for applications in pain and cancer therapy 
under the license agreement  we were obligated to pay idp royalties on worldwide sales of implantable infusion pumps using idp technology 
the january  acquisition canceled the license agreement  thereby eliminating our future royalty obligations  and expanded our rights to use the pump technologies in all applications through our acquisition of the intellectual property 
we completed development of our accurx fully implantable constant rate infusion pump in late using technology we licensed from idp 
we received ce mark approval to distribute the pump internationally and commenced sales internationally during the second quarter of fiscal we also received an investigational device exemption ide from the fda to initiate clinical trials in the united states 
the clinical trials include patients and are being conducted in fifteen sites 
the trials commenced in the first quarter of and are progressing according to plan 
the data gathered during the trials will be used to support our pma application 
also on january   we completed the acquisition of hi tronics designs  inc hdi or hi tronics  a privately held contract developer and original equipment manufacturer oem of electro mechanical devices headquartered in budd lake  new jersey 
we acquired hdi through a stock for stock merger in which we issued  shares of ans common stock 
the transaction is accounted for on a pooling of interests basis and accordingly  prior year results have been restated 
hdi developed and is the manufacturer of our genesis ipg and is also the oem manufacturer of the transmitter used with our renew radio frequency spinal cord stimulation system 
hdi was founded in and has developed more than sixty medical devices for some of the leading medical device companies in the fields of cardiology  neurology and orthopedics 
the core strength of hdi is in developing highly sophisticated electronic circuits with very low power requirements  utilizing both discrete and highly integrated technology 
we believe this competency  when combined with our own strengths in lead design and packaging  will allow us to develop more sophisticated products in compressed  development cycle timetables 
in addition  the merger will result in vertical integration benefits in manufacturing that should enhance margins on our current and future products 
as a result of hdi s fiscal year ending on a different date than the company s  for the one month period ended december  the results of operations of hdi have been charged directly to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the period ended december  during the month of december  hdi recorded net revenue of  and a loss before income tax benefit of  the net loss for the one month period ended december  was  results of hdi for this one month period were negatively impacted by a problem with a component supplied by a vendor 
this resulted in substantially lower than normal revenue since the products using the component could not be manufactured and delivered 
the component problem was quickly resolved with the vendor and shipments of products using the component commenced in late january in june  we entered into an agreement under which we would develop and manufacture products and systems for use in deep brain stimulation dbs for sofamor danek 
see note product development agreement of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received a payment of million upon execution of the agreement that was being recognized into income as revenue based upon the estimated completion of the development project 
during the year ended december   we recognized million into income as revenue 
the remaining  was recognized into income as revenue during january due to the termination of the agreement with sofamor danek as a result of the merger of sofamor danek and medtronic  inc in connection with the termination  we also received an additional payment of million from sofamor danek  which was recognized into income as revenue during january page results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net income of million or 
per diluted share in compared to  or 
per diluted share in the results for include a pretax expense of  for costs associated with our acquisition of hdi on january  these costs were expensed instead of capitalized because the acquisition is accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
total net revenue of million for the year ended december  increased from the comparable level of million 
this growth was attributable to both continued strong sales of our advanced neuromodulation products used to treat chronic pain  which increased to million  and higher sales at hdi  which increased to million 
on november   we received approval from the fda to begin marketing our genesis ipg in the united states and the first implants occurred in late december we formally launched the genesis ipg in the united states in january the launch of the genesis ipg could temporarily impede growth in sales of renew systems  which could affect the rate of our overall revenue and profitability growth 
although genesis and renew are targeted towards patients with different types of pain and genesis is not intended to replace renew in the neuromodulation market  some pain specialists may recommend genesis to their patients when they would have otherwise recommended renew  and consquently  genesis may substitute for some sales of renew 
although it is too early in the process to accurately predict the future impact of this factor  management believes that it is possible that sales of renew may plateau or even decline modestly  at lease during the first several months of genesis sales 
because neuromodulation devices have gained acceptance as a viable  efficacious and cost effective treatment alternative for relieving chronic intractable pain and improving neurological function  we are continuing our efforts to expand our product offerings in the high growth market of neuromodulation 
today  we are a market share and technology leader in the radio frequency stimulation segment of the neuromodulation market  which industry analysts expect to approach million in  and we are now only the second market participant in the totally implantable stimulation segment which industry analysts expect to approach million in over the last three years  to position us to participate in the other larger and more rapidly growing segments of the neuromodulation market  we continued to aggressively invest in development projects for our technology platforms  including our ipg for spinal cord stimulation  ipg for deep brain stimulation and a fully implantable constant rate infusion pump 
some of the fruits of our development efforts were realized during when we received ce mark approval and began commercialization of our genesis ipg and accurx constant flow implantable infusion pump in international markets during the first half of and when we received fda approval of our genesis ipg in november and subsequently launched it in the united states in january in  we plan to continue our development efforts on advanced technology platforms for stimulation and drug delivery therapies 
gross profit increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue discussed above and an improvement in gross profit margins 
gross profit margin increased to in compared to in  due to higher sales of the renew radio frequency spinal cord stimulation system  which contributes higher margins than hdi product sales  a reduction in specialty distributor sales where we recognize lower margins than sales through commissioned sales agents and operational efficiencies from higher manufacturing volumes 
total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in  and as a percentage of total net revenue  increased to in from in in  we continued to invest in our product development pipeline and in infrastructure to enhance our sales and marketing capabilities 
page research and development expense increased to million in  or of total net revenue  from million during  or of total net revenue 
this increase in the absolute dollar amount in compared to was the result of higher consulting expense and test material expense 
during  these expenditures were directed toward development of our ipg stimulation system platforms for spinal cord stimulation  our next generation radio frequency stimulation system platform  our proprietary constant rate infusion pump and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation 
marketing expense  as a percentage of total net revenue  increased from in to in  and the absolute dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commission expense from increased product sales and a change from distributors to commissioned sales agents in certain united states territories  higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions in reimbursement and direct sales personnel  higher expense for education and training of new implanters and higher expense for new product introductions 
general and administrative expense decreased to million during from million in and as a percentage of total net revenue  decreased to in from during the decrease in this expense during was principally the result of lower salary expense from a reduction in certain salaries of the former owners of hdi effective as of january when we acquired hdi 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in primarily due to additional amortization expense for patents we acquired from esox on january  other income decreased to an expense of  in from income of  in primarily as a result of an expense in of  for costs associated with the acquisition of hdi and lower interest income due to lower yields on invested funds 
income tax expense increased to million in from  in  and the overall effective tax rate was in compared to in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  results in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of 
in addition  approximately  of the  of costs incurred in the acquisition of hdi are not deductible for tax purposes  which also contributed to the higher effective tax rate during compared to the us statutory rate of 
comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net income of  or 
per diluted share in compared to million or 
per diluted share in the results benefited from million of revenue recorded in connection with our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
total net revenue of million for the year ended december   was million below the comparable level of million due to million of net revenue in the period associated with our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
excluding the development agreement revenue  net revenue increased to million in from million in this increase in net revenue was the result of higher unit sales volume of our renew systems  which increased million or to million 
sales at hdi also increased million or to million 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in due to the decrease in total net revenue discussed above and a decrease in gross profit margins 
gross profit margin decreased to in from in due to higher revenue from hdi  whose oem sales contribute lower gross margins than our proprietary neuromodulation products and the contract revenue in from our development agreement with sofamor danek  which contributed higher gross margins 
gross profit margin from sales of the neuromodulation products remained approximately the same at in the period compared to in the period 
page total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total net revenue  increased to in from in research and development expense decreased in absolute dollars to million in  or of total net revenue  from million during  or of total net revenue 
this decrease in absolute dollars during compared to was the result of lower consulting expense 
during  these expenditures were directed toward development of our ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation  our next generation radio frequency stimulation system  our proprietary constant rate infusion pump and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation 
marketing expense  as a percentage of total net revenue  increased from in to in  while the absolute dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commission expense from increased product sales and a change from distributors to commissioned sales agents in certain united states territories  higher expense for education and training of new implanters and higher convention expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million during to million in and as a percentage of total net revenue  increased to in from during the increase of  in absolute dollar expense during was principally the result of higher legal expense  property tax expense  investor relations expense and consulting expense 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased slightly to million in from million during due to expense for additional patents we licensed 
other income decreased to  in from  in primarily as a result of lower interest income due to lower funds available for investment 
income tax expense decreased to  in from million in due to lower income before income taxes in compared to  as the period included the million termination payment from our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
this represents effective tax rates of in and in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  resulted in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital increased to million from million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  page we increased our investment in inventories to million at december   from million at december  this increase from year end was primarily the result of three factors 
first  we increased our investment in consignment inventories as a result of adding fifteen commissioned sales agents during to whom we provide approximately  in consignment inventory each 
second  we purchased raw material and produced finished goods inventory for our accurx drug pump to support its launch internationally and for clinical trails in the united states 
third and most significantly  we purchased raw materials and produced finished goods of our genesis ipg to support our international launch during and to prepare for our launch in the united states in january we spent million during for capital expenditures  non competes and license fees for additional patents and intellectual property we are licensing 
of these expenditures  million was spent for manufacturing tooling and equipment for new products we developed  including the genesis ipg and accurx drug pump   was spent for computer equipment and office furniture   was spent for license fees and non competes and  was spent for leasehold improvements 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our current levels of operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we currently have no credit facilities in place 
if we decide to acquire complementary businesses or product lines  or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances that require substantial capital  we intend to finance those activities by the most attractive alternative available  which could be bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in   in and million in net cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in net income of  million in from  in and a million decrease in the amount of cash used for changes in working capital components million in to million in 
for compared to  net cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in to  in  a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease in compared to was primarily the result of a million decrease in net income  in from million in due to the period including the million pretax termination payment from our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
in however  we reduced the cash used for changes in working capital components from million in to million in  a reduction of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in while investing activities provided cash of  in in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities million and capital expenditures million for additional manufacturing tooling and equipment  office furniture and equipment  non compete agreements and licensing fees for patents  while maturing certificates of deposit and sales of marketable securities provided cash of million 
in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities and certificates of deposit with maturities over days million and capital expenditures million for additional manufacturing tooling and equipment  office furniture and equipment and licensing fees for patents  while maturing certificates of deposit and the sale of marketable securities provided cash of  in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities  and capital expenditures million for leasehold improvements and furnishings and equipment for our newly leased plano  texas facility  manufacturing tooling and equipment and licensing fees for patents  while we received net proceeds of million from the sale of our facility to atrion corporation and  from the sale of marketable securities 
page net cash provided by financing activities was  in and million in  while financing activities in used cash of million 
during  we used  to reduce certain debt obligations  while we received approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
during  we used  to reduce certain debt obligations  while we received million of cash from the exercise of stock options million  the private placement of common stock  and proceeds from a long term note payable 
during  we used million to repay our mortgage debt when we sold our facility to atrion corporation and million for share repurchases  while we received approximately  from the exercise of stock options 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend  new market  potential market applications  and similar expressions and variations are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following failure of our genesis ipg to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we formally introduced our genesis ipg device in the us in january we believe that the potential for growth in the ipg segment of the neuromodulation market is much greater than in the rf segment 
accordingly  our ability to generate increased revenue and profitability  and thus our general success  will depend  in large part  on the market s acceptance of our new ipg device 
as a new entrant into the ipg market  there are many reasons we might not achieve market acceptance on a timely basis  if at all  including the following competing products  technologies and therapies are available  and others may be introduced  that gain greater and faster doctor and patient acceptance than our ipg device  and our only competitor in the ipg market has had its ipg product on the market for some time and enjoys significant brand awareness among pain specialists 
if industry analysts are correct that the ipg segment of the neuromodulation will grow at a much faster rate than the rf segment  our failure to successfully market and sell our ipg device could negatively affect our revenue growth rate and our profitability 
page our main competitor has significantly greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to successfully compete in the neurostimulation market 
the medical device market is highly competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
medtronic  inc is the largest and strongest competitor in the medical device sector  and is currently our sole competitor in the neurostimulation market 
medtronic is a large publicly traded company and enjoys several competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater name recognition  greater resources for product research and development  sales and marketing  distribution  patent protection and pursuing regulatory approvals  a greater number of established relationships with health care professionals  customers and third party payors  and multiple product lines and the ability to bundle products together or offer discounts  rebates or other incentives to secure a competitive advantage 
medtronic  and possibly other future competitors  will continue to develop new products that compete directly with our products  and its greater resources may allow it to respond more quickly to new technologies  new treatment indications or changes in customer requirements 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against medtronic or against similar future competitors 
any adverse changes in coverage or reimbursement amounts by medicare  medicaid  workers compensation programs or private insurers  including insurance companies and hmos  may limit our ability to market and sell our products 
in the united states  our products are generally covered by medicare  medicaid and other third party payors  such as workers compensation programs  insurance companies and hmos  which reimburse patients for all or part of the cost of the products 
third party payors carefully scrutinize whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
if the neuromodulation market continues to grow  third party payors may cut back their coverage of neuromodulation devices in an effort to control increasing costs 
if medicare or other third party payors decide to eliminate  or reduce coverage amounts on patient reimbursements for our products  this could limit our ability to market and sell our products in the us  which would materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
international market acceptance of our products may also depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals may negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought 
if patients choose non invasive alternatives to our products  our sales could be negatively impacted 
we sell medical devices for invasive or minimally invasive surgical procedures 
if patients choose non invasive alternatives to our products  this could negatively affect our sales 
patient acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including the failure of non invasive therapies to help the patient  the degree of invasiveness involved in the procedures used to implant our products  the rate and severity of complications from the procedures used to implant our products and any adverse side effects caused by the implanting of our products 
page patients are always more likely first to consider non invasive alternatives to treat their pain 
the first tier of therapies along the treatment continuum available to patients includes over the counter medications and physical therapy 
if these therapies fail  patients generally try the second tier of therapies  which includes non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  tens therapy application of electrical impulses on the skin  psychological therapy and nerve blocks injections that provide temporary pain relief 
if these therapies were unsuccessful  patients might then try the third tier of therapies  which includes narcotic and opiod drugs  neurolysis destruction of the affected nerve and thermal procedures 
if first  second and third tier pain therapies are not effective  patients might then consider whether to use our products or undergo more invasive surgical procedures 
if doctors do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales could be negatively impacted and we may be unable to increase our revenues and profitability 
our products are based on evolving concepts and techniques in pain management 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products compared to alternative therapies and competing products  and on training pain specialists in the proper use of our products 
in order for us to sell our products  we must successfully educate and train pain specialists so that these pain specialists will understand our products and feel comfortable recommending and endorsing them 
we may not be able to accomplish this  and even if we are successful in educating and training pain specialists  there is no guarantee that we will obtain their recommendations and endorsements 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may take advantage of our ideas and compete directly against us 
we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate us patent protection for new products or ideas  or prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation may be necessary to enforce them  which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of the attention of our management and key technical employees 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to develop new products or enhance their existing products 
this could harm our competitive position  decrease our market share or otherwise harm our business 
other parties may sue us for infringing their intellectual property rights 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the medical technology industry regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we may be forced to defend ourselves against allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these rights are invalid or unenforceable 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we would be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be non exclusive  and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
page failure to obtain necessary government approvals for new products and for new applications for existing products would mean we could not sell those new products  or sell our existing products for those new applications 
our products are medical devices  which are subject to extensive government regulation in the united states and in foreign countries where we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive either k clearance or pma from the fda with respect to each application for which we intend to market it 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months from the date the application is complete  but may take longer 
additionally  k clearance can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
the pma process is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years from the date the application is complete  however  completing the pma application is a process that can take numerous clinical trials and require the filing of amendments over time 
the result of these lengthy approval processes is that a new product  or a new application for an existing product  cannot be brought to market for a number of years after it is developed 
if we fail to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals of our new products or new applications for existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  we will be unable to market the affected products for their intended applications in those jurisdictions 
modification of any marketed device could require a new k clearance or pma or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
any modification we want to make to an fda cleared or approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  would require a new k clearance  or possibly a new pma 
under fda procedures  we would make the initial determination of whether to seek a new k clearance or pma  but the fda could review our decision 
if the fda did not agree with our decision not to seek a new k clearance or pma and decided to require us to seek either k clearance or pma for modifications we have already made to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
we could also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we will be unable to sell our products if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations 
in order to commercially manufacture our products  we must comply with government manufacturing regulations that govern design controls  quality systems and documentation policies and procedures 
the fda and equivalent foreign governmental authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities 
our failure to comply with these manufacturing regulations may prevent or delay our marketing or distribution of our products  which would negatively impact our business 
for a description of the manufacturing regulations with which we must comply  see item business government regulation 
our products are subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would harm our reputation 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated or our own voluntary recall could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
any recall of product would divert managerial and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers 
page our failure to comply with all applicable government regulations could subject us to numerous penalties  any of which could adversely affect our business 
if we do not comply with all applicable government regulations  government authorities could do any of the following impose fines and penalties on us  prevent us from manufacturing our products  bring civil or criminal charges against us  delay the introduction of our new products into the market  recall or seize our products  disrupt the manufacture or distribution of our products  or withdraw or deny approvals for our products 
any one of these results could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our reliance on a single supplier for a component used in both of our main products could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on time 
we rely on a single supplier for the computer chip used in the receivers of our rf device and the programmer of our ipg device 
the supplier of this computer chip has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date has not determined when this will occur 
the supplier has agreed to notify us when a date has been determined and allow us to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  we are maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip and are working to develop a new receiver design that does not use a custom computer chip 
until we develop this new receiver  any sudden disruption in supply from our current computer chip supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished rf and ipg products on time 
one specialty distributor currently accounts for a significant percentage of our neuromodulation products segment revenue 
during  we had one specialty distributor  sun medical  inc  that accounted for million  or  of our net revenue from the neuromodulation products segment 
while we believe that our relationship with sun medical is good  the loss of this distributor could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
the launch of genesis could temporarily impede growth in sales of renew  which would adversely affect our short term revenues and profitability 
our genesis device is currently the newest neurostimulation product on the market 
although genesis and renew are targeted towards patients with different types of pain and genesis is not intended to replace renew in the neurostimulation market  some pain specialists may recommend genesis to their patients when they would have otherwise recommended renew  and  consequently  genesis may cannibalize or substitute for some sales of renew 
if this occurs  it could lead to a short term slowdown in the growth in sales of renew
