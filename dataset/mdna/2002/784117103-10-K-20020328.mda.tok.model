results of operations consolidated overview our operations and organizational structures were realigned in into business units that offer products and services tailored for particular market segments 
our reportable segments are private banking and trust  investment advisors  enterprises  money managers  and investments in new businesses 
the accounting policies of our business segments are the same as those used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates financial performance of its operating segments based on income from operations 
financial information for periods prior to has been restated to conform to current year presentation 
revenues and income from operations by segment for   and are as follows in thousands year ended december  private banking and trust revenues    income from operations    investment advisors revenues    income from operations    enterprises revenues    income from operations    money managers revenues    income loss from operations   investments in new businesses revenues    loss from operations    general and administrative loss from operations    consolidated segment totals revenues    income from operations    consolidated revenues in were million  an increase of million  or percent  from consolidated revenues in increased million  or percent  to million over our revenues are primarily derived from information processing services or from assets we manage and administer 
approximately percent of our revenues were derived from the assets we manage and administer during   and the remaining percent for each year were received from our information processing services 
the key factor contributing to higher revenues in and was increased sales to new clients and the delivery of new products and services to existing clients 
we believe this is the result of strong acceptance of our products and services in most of our target markets 
another primary factor affecting our revenues was the growth in the value of the assets we manage and administer 
declines in the capital markets during the latter half of have inhibited our revenue expansion 
also  economic uncertainty during the past year has slowed many purchase decisions in most of our target markets 
operating income improved in by million  or percent  and in by million  or percent  over prior year comparable periods 
we also experienced improved operating margins 
operating margins were percent in  percent in  and percent in this was primarily due to the increase in our revenues and the economies of scale and operational efficiencies built into our operations 
the investment in our operating infrastructure and in the internet has improved client service and created other efficiencies in our operations 
also  a portion of our personnel costs are paid in the form of incentive and sales compensation that are tied to predetermined performance goals at the corporate and business unit levels 
actual performance is compared to the target goals and determines the actual amount of bonuses to be paid for the year 
as a percentage of sales  incentive and sales compensation expense for was lower than  whereas was higher than our future growth is dependent upon our ability to deliver new products and services in our portfolio of businesses 
also  we must continue to generate economies of scale in our back office and investment management operations  and focus our technology spending 
however  any expected growth in revenues and earnings may be negated by a decrease in the capital markets  mergers and acquisitions among our client base  loss of clients to competitors  and deferred decision making among our target client base 
asset balances in millions as of december  assets invested in equity and fixed income programs    assets invested in liquidity funds    assets under management    client proprietary assets under administration    assets under management and administration    assets under management consist of total assets invested in our equity and fixed income investment programs and liquidity funds for which we provide management services

these services primarily include fund administration and accounting  legal services  shareholder recordkeeping  and marketing 
revenues are based on a percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of the proprietary funds

year ended december  revenues investment processing fees    fund processing fees    investment management fees    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased in by million  or percent  as compared to  and accounted for percent of consolidated revenues  down slightly from percent in revenues increased in by million  or percent  over investment processing fees accounts for the majority of this segments revenue growth and was largely due to increased sales activity in our core service bureau business 
revenue increases were primarily driven by new clients and merger activity in the national and regional bank segment  and increased brokerage services during revenue increases in came mostly from the cross selling of new products and services that provide our clients with a broader business solution that incorporates the use of new technology 
revenue growth for and were also affected by events in fund processing fees 
fund processing fees decreased during because of the loss of several significant clients involved in mergers 
the loss of these clients caused our assets under administration to decline by approximately billion in the third quarter of fund processing fees in increased due to an increase in average assets under administration  though these gains were partially offset by a decrease in average basis points earned relating to fee concessions extended to existing clients in exchange for longer term contracts and a reduction in the range of certain services provided to large bank clients 
operating income in increased million  or percent  as compared to operating income in increased million  or percent  over operating margins also increased slightly each year 
the increase in operating income and margin in each comparable period was primarily due to the increase in revenues already discussed 
an additional factor affecting operating income and margin was our business model that seeks economies of scale and operational efficiencies and the timing of various marketing and development expenses 
we believe our future growth in revenues and income will come from our ability to develop new products and services for existing markets and expansion into new markets 
however  future revenue growth will be affected by the loss of the fund processing clients in the third quarter of in addition  consolidations among our banking clients  as well as deferred decision making will continue to be major strategic issues facing this segment

revenues are primarily earned through management fees that are based upon a percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of assets under management 
year ended december  revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenues operating and development sales and marketing revenues in increased million  or percent  as compared to and accounted for percent of consolidated revenues in  up from percent in revenues in grew million  or percent  as compared to the increase in revenues in both comparable periods was primarily due to growth in assets under management as a result of our success at recruiting new registered investment advisors 
our total advisor network consists of approximately  advisors and increased by approximately  advisors in and  advisors in revenues were also affected by movements in the capital markets 
operating income and margin improved in each period primarily due to new business activity 
operating income increased million  or percent  in over and million  or percent  in over despite this improvement in operating income  new business activity was negatively impacted by the significant devaluation in the capital markets during operating income and margins also were affected by our ability to utilize many shared resources across a larger revenue base  thereby creating some efficiencies in our operations 
future growth in revenues and income from operations depends  in part  on our ability to generate new business and obtain additional assets under management from existing customers 
we plan to sustain new business activity through new product offerings 
however  the capital markets will remain unpredictable

our retirement business solution established new relationships during and new relationships during we feel this increase in new sales is the result of increased market acceptance of our outsource business solution across a diverse range of clients 
we believe the weak economy in caused revenue growth to slow  as compared to  as clients deferred purchase decisions 
operating income and margin increased significantly in both comparable periods 
operating income in increased million  or percent  as compared to operating income in increased million  or percent  over operating income and margins in and were affected by new business activity  as well as timing of certain expenditures  especially sales and marketing expenses 
during and  we incurred significant technology costs associated with the development of our treasury solutions platform 
these difficult market conditions reinforce our investment management strategy  which leans heavily on diversification and risk management 
although we believe we are well positioned and poised to grow  our revenues and earnings could be significantly affected by continued volatility in the capital markets

however  the decline in the capital markets during partially offset revenue growth from new business activity 
conversely  the somewhat more stable capital markets in supported revenue growth 
operating income in increased by million as compared to operating income in increased by million over operating margins also improved 
the increase in operating income and margin was due to the increase in revenues and our ability to utilize our infrastructure in a manner that can create economies of scale and operational efficiencies 
in addition  expenses during and included significant investments in developing the necessary infrastructure to tailor our products and services in these markets

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no

the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results includes the following revenue recognition principal sources of revenues are information processing and software services  management  administration  and distribution of mutual funds  brokerage and consulting services  and other asset management products and services 
information processing and software service fees are generally based on the number of trust accounts a client has on our trust system 
these revenues are recurring in nature based upon contractual agreements 
administration and distribution fees are based upon a percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily asset value of the funds 
management fees are based upon a percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of assets under management 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which they are performed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do have offices located outside the united states that conduct business in local currencies of that country 
all foreign operations aggregate approximately percent of total consolidated revenues  which are spread across several countries with different currencies 
due to this limited activity  we do not hedge against foreign operations nor do we expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and other borrowings 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we place our investments in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
we insure the preservation of our index funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk through the use of derivatives 
the interest rate on our long term debt is fixed and is not traded on any established market 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our long term debt 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair value of our investments available for sale 
to provide some protection against potential fair value changes associated with our investments available for sale  we have entered into various derivative financial transactions 
the derivative instruments are used to hedge changes in the fair market value of certain investments available for sale 
we currently hold derivatives with a notional amount of million with various terms  generally less than one year 
the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis using quantitative measures of correlation 
if a hedge is ineffective  any excess gains or losses attributable to such ineffectiveness are recognized in current period earnings 
during  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness that was credited to current period earnings was a gain of 
million 
we believe the derivative financial instruments entered into provide protection against volatile swings in market valuation associated with our investments available for sale 
during  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
