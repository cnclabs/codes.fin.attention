item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial data includes snaptrack  inc  v sper holding ltd 
and other consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we design  manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma and other technologies 
we derive revenue principally from license fees and royalties from our intellectual property  from sales of integrated circuit products  from services and related hardware sales and from software development and related services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of revenues  research and development  selling  general and administrative  amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets  and asset impairment and related charges 
our qualcomm cdma technologies qct segment is a leading developer and supplier of cdma based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications and global positioning system products 
qct software products are the interface link between the operating system that controls the phone and the functionality embedded in our integrated circuit products 
qct products are sold to many of the world s leading wireless phone and infrastructure manufacturers 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct s operating margin was in fiscal  compared to in and in the increase in operating margin in as compared to was primarily related to a change in product mix toward higher end devices utilizing our cdma x products 
the decrease in operating margin in as compared to was primarily related to increased research and development costs associated with new integrated circuit product and technology initiatives  as well as increased advertising expenses 
our qualcomm technology licensing qtl segment receives license fees and royalty payments for use of our cdma technology by domestic and international wireless telecommunications equipment suppliers 
qtl generates revenue from license fees for our patented cdma eg  cdmaone  cdma  wcdma and td scdma technologies as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees that design  manufacture and sell products incorporating our cdma technology 
qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qtl s operating margin was in fiscal  compared to in and our qualcomm wireless internet qwi segment  which includes qualcomm wireless business solutions qwbs  qualcomm internet services qis and qualcomm digital media qdm  generates revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services  software  and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qwi s operating margin was a negative in fiscal  compared to positive in and in the decrease in operating margin from to  and from to  was primarily due to expenses incurred in the development  support and marketing efforts related to the brew product 
our qualcomm strategic initiatives qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
our strategy is to invest in cdma carriers  licensed device manufacturers and start up companies that we believe open new markets for cmda technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology to promote internet data communications 
the qsi segment s revenues relate primarily to the consolidation of our investment in v sper holding 
qsi revenues comprised of fiscal total consolidated revenues 
qsi did not generate revenues in or qsi s operating margin was negative in and was not meaningful in or 
table of contents recent global economic weakness has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
we cannot predict whether a recovery will occur or what effects negative events  such as war  may have on the economy 
further  an economic recovery  if it occurs  may not benefit us in the near term 
if it does not  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
to increase our revenues and market share in future periods  we are dependent upon the adoption and commercial deployment of g wireless communications equipment  products and services based on our cdma technology 
although network operators have commercially deployed cdma x  we cannot predict the timing or success of other commercial deployments 
if existing deployments are not commercially successful  or if new commercial deployments of cdma x are delayed or unsuccessful  our business and financial results may be harmed 
we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that competition will continue 
historically  this competition has resulted and is expected to continue to result in reduced average selling prices for our products and those of our customers and licensees 
reductions in the average selling price of our licensees products generally results in reduced average royalties 
while this trend has  to a large extent  been mitigated by the introduction of new features and functionality in our licensees products  there is no guarantee that such mitigation will continue 
the wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants  and this trend may continue 
if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that compete with cdma  then cdma may lose market share unless the surviving entity continues to deploy cdma 
this consolidation could also result in delays in or cancellation of purchasing decisions by the merged companies  negatively affecting our revenues and operating results 
we will continue to expand our international sales operations and enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect international sales and support channels  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues 
if we are not able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products and technologies  then we may not be able to maintain an acceptable rate of growth in our business 
revenues from customers in the united states  south korea  and japan comprised  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  as compared to   and  respectively  in fiscal  and  and  respectively  in fiscal we distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location 
the decreases in revenues from customers in the united states  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to the sale of the terrestrial based cdma wireless consumer phone business in february and a decrease in revenues related to business with globalstar 
the increases in revenues from customers in south korea  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to the commercial deployment of our g cdma x technology in october in south korea  where million  or  of the nation s total mobile service users were using this technology by the end of october the general increase in revenues from customers in japan as a percentage of the total is primarily attributed to an ongoing migration to g services  illustrated by kddi s expectation of million  or  of their subscriber base using g services by march  as reported by the cdg 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making 
table of contents judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from royalties  from sales of integrated circuit products  from services and related hardware sales  from software development and related services  and from license fees for intellectual property 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate method of revenue recognition involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal and applied retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal we recognized million and million during fiscal and  respectively  in net income before income taxes and accounting changes related to revenue and expense that was recognized in prior years 
we continue to monitor developments in emerging issues task force discussions of issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and issue g  recognition of revenue from licensing arrangements on intellectual property  to determine what  if any  impact a final consensus may have on our revenue recognition policy 
we license rights to use our intellectual property portfolio  which includes patent rights to use cdmaone  cdma  cdma x  cdma x ev do  td scdma and wcdma technologies 
licensees typically pay a non refundable license fee and on going royalties on their sales of products incorporating our intellectual property 
license fees are generally recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we generally recognize royalty revenue as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
certain royalty revenues are accrued based on estimates prior to the reporting of such revenues by our licensees 
estimates of royalty revenues are based on analyses of historical royalty data by licensee  the relationship between the timing of our sales of integrated circuits to our licensees and our licensees sales of cdma phones and infrastructure equipment  average sales price forecasts  and current market and economic trends 
when our licensees report royalties for which we accrued revenues based on estimates  we adjust revenues for the period in which the reports are received 
revenues from sales of our cdma based integrated circuits are recognized at the time of shipment  or when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  if later 
revenues and expenses from sales of certain satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging and position reporting hardware and related software products are recognized ratably over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the expected messaging service period  which is typically five years  as the messaging service is considered integral to the functionality of the hardware and software 
revenues from providing services are recorded when earned 
revenues from long term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs 
revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
if actual contract costs are greater than expected  reduction of contract profit would be required 
billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as unearned revenue 
estimated contract losses are recognized when determined 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract s duration is relatively short  we use the completed contract method 
revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met the written agreement is executed  the software is delivered  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the license fee is probable  and if applicable  when vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total 
table of contents license fee to elements of multiple element arrangements  including post contract customer support 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements and defer revenue for the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied  or if the only undelivered element is post contract customer support  revenue is recognized ratably over the support period 
significant judgments and estimates are made in connection with the recognition of software license revenue  including assessments of collectibility and the fair values of deliverable elements 
the amount or timing of our software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these judgments or estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably assured customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if we have no previous experience with the customer  we typically obtain reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors 
we may also request financial information  including financial statements or other documents eg  bank statements to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment 
if these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonable assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of entities we have financed to make required payments 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for doubtful finance and note receivables based on analyses of the financed entities credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  review of the entities current and projected financial and operational information  and consideration of the fair value of collateral to be received  if applicable 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
if the financial condition of the financed entities were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
valuation of intangible assets and investments our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority strategic investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry 
table of contents and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
we hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine 
we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
we also consider new products services that the investee may have forthcoming  any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee s competitors and or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates 
income taxes our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
since we believe it is more likely than not that deductions from future employee stock option exercises will exceed future taxable income  we have provided a valuation allowance through equity on substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
we consider estimated future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
we can only use our capital losses and capital loss carrybacks or carryforwards to offset capital gains 
we have developed tax planning strategies to generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal any additional capital losses in future years may require us to set up a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets through our statement of operations if we are unable to generate sufficient future capital gains to offset these additional capital losses through our tax planning strategies 
we consider the operating earnings of non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
should we have to repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
strategic investments and financing our qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
in general  we enter into strategic 
table of contents relationships with cdma carriers and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
as part of the agreement to sell our infrastructure equipment business to ericsson in  we have provided equipment financing to customers of ericsson on a shared basis with respect to ericsson s sale of cdma infrastructure in brazil  mexico and elsewhere 
our qsi segment selects and manages strategic investments in early stage companies and  from time to time  venture funds or incubators  to support the adoption of cdma and use of the wireless internet 
most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic objectives  we attempt to make regular periodic sales that are recognized in investment expense income 
we may reduce or suspend the planned sale of these investments if and when market conditions decline 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment expense income 
during fiscal  we recognized million in charges related to other than temporary losses on marketable and private securities 
in some cases  we make strategic investments in early stage companies which require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of those companies 
the consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments 
from time to time  we may accept equity interests in a licensee as consideration for a portion or all of the license fees payable under our cdma license agreements 
we record license fee revenues based on the fair values of the equity instruments received  if determinable 
the measurement date for determination of fair value is the earlier of the date on which the parties establish a commitment to perform or the date at which the performance is complete 
the evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is publicly traded  examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee s business plan if not publicly traded  and performing other due diligence procedures 
we account for the equity received using apb or fas  as appropriate 
this program will not affect the licensees obligations to pay royalties under their cdma license agreements 
the amount of cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms of each agreement 
as of september   nine licensees have participated in this program 
we recognized million and million of revenue in fiscal and  respectively  and no revenue in fiscal related to equity received as consideration for license fees 
velocom  inc on november   we forgave million under our debt facility with velocom  inc velocom  an investor in v sper holding 
we also converted our remaining million convertible promissory note into equity securities of velocom the velocom exchange in conjunction with our acquisition of v sper holding 
the velocom exchange increased our equity interest in velocom to 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in velocom 
at september   our investment in velocom was million  net of our equity in velocom s losses 
v sper holding  ltd 
in fiscal  we acquired an approximate ownership interest in v sper sao paulo sa and v sper sa the v sper operating companies or collectively  v sper 
the v sper operating companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide fixed wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern  northeast and eastern regions of brazil and in the state of sao paulo 
in addition  we extended long term financing to the v sper operating companies related to our financing arrangement with ericsson 
on november   we consummated a series of transactions as part of an overall financial restructuring the restructuring of the v sper operating companies 
pursuant to the restructuring  we committed to invest million  and velocom committed to invest million  in a newly formed holding company called v sper holding 
v sper holding acquired certain liabilities of the v sper operating companies from their vendors for million and the issuance of warrants to purchase an approximate interest in v sper holding  and the vendors released in full any claims that 
table of contents they might have against us  velocom  the v sper operating companies and other related parties arising from or related to the acquired liabilities 
in a series of related transactions  v sper holding agreed to contribute the acquired liabilities to the v sper operating companies in exchange for equity securities and to cancel the contributed liabilities 
at september   we directly owned of the issued and outstanding equity of v sper holding  and we indirectly owned an additional of v sper holding through our ownership interest in velocom  totaling an direct and indirect interest 
the purchase price allocation  based on the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed  included million for property  plant and equipment  million for licenses  and million for other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from to years 
licenses and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of years and to years  respectively 
when we obtained the controlling interest in v sper holding  accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  required that we adjust our prior period results to account for our original ownership interest in the v sper operating companies  predecessors to v sper holding  using the equity method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded million  million and million of equity in losses of the v sper operating companies for fiscal pre acquisition  and  respectively 
we recorded a million reduction in finance receivables  an million reduction in other assets and a million reduction in retained earnings at september  we previously recorded million in asset impairment charges and other than temporary losses on other investments during fiscal because those charges did not exceed the losses recorded as a result of using the equity method  our net loss for fiscal increased by million 
we did not record any asset impairment charges or other than temporary losses during fiscal  and as a result of using the equity method  the net income for fiscal decreased by million 
in july  a group of brazilian mobile operators sued the v sper operating companies  claiming v sper violated its stfc fixed license by allowing full mobility on its network 
the court issued an order temporarily restraining v sper from continued sales of its limited mobility product pending the trial 
this order did not impact v sper s existing customers  nor sales of other types of products 
subsequently  anatel  the brazilian telecommunications regulatory agency  placed a similar administrative hold on v sper until such time as it could determine whether v sper was in compliance with existing regulations 
v sper successfully appealed the court order  and the temporary restraint was lifted although the underlying court case remains to be tried 
additionally  v sper and anatel reviewed the issue from a technical and regulatory standpoint  and the parties reached an agreement which allows v sper to resume sales of its limited mobility product once certain technical adjustments to restrict broad mobility are implemented in v sper s network 
v sper has commenced making such technical adjustments and expects to complete them in all of its markets over the next few months 
sales of the affected products have resumed in those areas in which the technical modifications have already been completed 
during september  v sper decided to replace all towers manufactured by one of its third party contractors due to the identification of structural defects  resulting in an asset impairment charge of million 
this decision was made after severe storm winds damaged and or destroyed a number of v sper towers manufactured by that third party contractor 
overall  this replacement program impacts up to v sper towers  which carry antennae for less than of v sper base stations 
v sper towers manufactured by other parties were also inspected during this process and found to be in proper condition 
replacements have begun for the most critical towers  and all affected towers are expected to be replaced by march v sper has not experienced and does not expect to experience any appreciable service degradation during this replacement process 
v sper also is seeking to complete a tower sale leaseback of a portion of its tower sites by december   including the defective towers  pursuant to which the purchasing party would assume all further liability for the purchased towers and fulfill replacement construction obligations 
v sper expects the tower sale leaseback arrangement  which includes the cost of replacing the defective towers  to provide net cash inflows during calendar 
table of contents in september  anatel issued resolution  which modifies certain current telecommunications regulations 
as part of this resolution and prior resolutions  v sper will be required to vacate its current spectrum in the mhz frequency analogous to united states band a d in the coming years to enable the frequency to be allotted to future universal mobile telecommunications system umts license holders 
in return  v sper has been assigned new mhz frequencies analogous to united states pcs band c 
pursuant to resolution  upon completion of up banding of its network  v sper would be permitted to utilize the new mhz frequencies for its primary allocation for fixed wireless services as well as to apply for permission to use those frequencies for full mobility services offered under an smp mobile license 
such secondary use of the new mhz frequencies for smp mobile services would require v sper to either obtain its own smp license s or to enter into an arrangement with an smp license holder whereby cdma mobility at mhz would be offered by the license holder utilizing v sper s up banded infrastructure 
significant costs  constraints and hurdles exist with respect to accomplishing these objectives  including v sper s or another party s ability to acquire the necessary smp license s  uncertainty whether and to what extent applicable brazilian telecommunications regulations would require v sper to build out additional infrastructure in another frequency band in order to offer smp mobile services  the cost of up banding v sper s cdma radio interface equipment  and uncertainty whether reimbursement for such costs can be obtained from future umts license holder s 
on november   we won bids to acquire mobile licenses in the state of sao paulo excluding sao paulo metro  the state of minas gerais  and in the northeast region of brazil license areas   and  respectively 
the new mobile licenses cover areas with a combined population in excess of million 
the mobile licenses overlap with approximately of v sper holding s existing wireless local loop areas 
none of the mobile licenses cover an area outside of v sper holding s current coverage areas 
approximately million of the approximate million total purchase price is payable by december  the remaining million brazilian real denominated obligation is financed by the brazilian government at an interest rate of  plus an adjustment for inflation  payable in six equal annual installments 
the first such installment payment is due in months 
access to long term funding sources to fund growth is a critical issue for v sper 
we continue to seek strategic partners and or acquirers to participate in this process 
we continue to invest in v sper to ensure the establishment of cdma based systems and to provide cdma coverage and roaming possibilities to as many regions throughout brazil as possible 
the investment will help us grow our revenues from royalties and from the sale of integrated circuits to phone manufacturers 
in other words  our return on our investment in v sper is not limited to a v sper ownership interest  but also includes indirect revenues  including cdma licensing revenues and qct integrated circuit sales from third party suppliers to v sper 
further  the v sper business plan  similar to other start up wireless operators  indicates that we should receive a return on our investment in the long run despite losses in the initial years 
the v sper operating companies expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations through calendar as they expand operations and enter new markets  even if and after they achieve positive cash flows from operations in the initial operating markets 
v sper expects to commercially launch cdma xev do services in december to date no long term funding commitments from other sources have been secured  and it is not clear whether future commitments from outside parties will be available 
furthermore  important regulatory and business issues have yet to be resolved 
if these issues cannot be resolved in a prompt and reasonable manner  risks related to v sper may increase  and we may incur significant losses 
specifically  if v sper is unable to offer converged services  which includes full mobility  either by itself and or through other parties utilizing v sper s cdma network  we may need to write down v sper s long lived assets 
in that management believes there is currently a regulatory path to mobility and several partnership and or other potential means under which v sper could offer mobile services  we believe that the assets are recoverable at this time 
pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa we have various financing arrangements  including a bridge loan facility  an equipment loan facility and an interim loan facility  with pegaso comunicaciones y sistemas sa de sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa  a cdma wireless operating company in mexico collectively 
table of contents referred to as pegaso 
on september   telef nica m viles telef nica acquired a controlling interest in pegaso the close 
the bridge facility was payable in full on october   was in default and was subject to a forbearance agreement at september  at september   million was outstanding under the bridge loan facility  net of deferred interest and unearned fees 
we stopped recognizing interest on the bridge loan facility effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter of pegaso paid million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility on november  the bridge payment 
the equipment loan facility and related financing were in default and subject to a forbearance agreement at september  at september   million was outstanding under the equipment loan facility  net of deferred interest and unearned fees 
the equipment loan facility was payable through december  and bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or libor plus when in default 
we stopped recognizing interest on the equipment loan facility and related financing effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter of the terms of the equipment loan facility and related financing were modified  retroactive to september   upon receipt of the bridge payment and the satisfaction of other conditions 
we will be required to use approximately million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by pegaso to other lenders 
financing related to the equipment loan facility in the amount of million will be payable in march the remaining equipment loan facility  including the acquired vendor debt  will be payable quarterly starting in march through december and will bear interest at libor plus for two years  libor plus for the next three years and libor plus thereafter 
we recognized million in interest income on the equipment loan facility during fiscal from the close through fiscal year end at libor plus 
during fiscal  we provided to pegaso million of interim financing  including million in capitalized fees  and million of additional interim financing 
prior to the close  a pegaso shareholder purchased million and million participations in the interim and additional interim finance receivables  respectively  from us  and at close  converted those portions of the interim and additional interim financings into equity in pegaso 
at september   million and million were outstanding under the interim and additional interim facilities  respectively 
the interim and additional interim financing commitments were cancelled at close  and the interim and additional interim finance receivables were repaid in full with interest on october  also in connection with the close  telef nica paid million to us in consideration for warrants to acquire equity in pegaso at close  and pegaso paid million to us in october related to certain fees and expense reimbursements 
as a result of the close  we recognized a total of million in interest income in fiscal at september   finance and other receivables from pegaso totaled million  net of million in deferred interest income that will be amortized over the remaining term of the equipment loan facility as an adjustment to yield 
we received million of this amount in october and an additional million when the bridge payment was made in november  excluding the million portion of the bridge payment that will be used to acquire vendor debt 
after receipt of the bridge payment  million of the september  finance receivables remains  net of deferred interest 
in the event that pegaso were to initiate the commercialization of gsm or tdma services in its spectrum  pegaso would be obliged to prepay million of that amount 
telefonica has recently indicated its intention to deploy gsm in mexico 
our aggregate commitments to provide additional long term financing to pegaso under our arrangements with ericsson were million as of september   subject to pegaso meeting certain conditions 
of this amount  million was cancelled when pegaso made the bridge payment  and the remaining million is no longer available to pegaso as a result of a series of events that occurred in november we also had million in other financing commitments to pegaso as of september  that were cancelled when pegaso made the bridge payment 
pegaso is at an early stage of development and may not be able to compete successfully 
competitors in mexico have greater financial resources and more established operations than pegaso 
as is normal for early 
table of contents stage wireless operators  pegaso is experiencing significant losses and negative cash flows from operations 
based on current information and available evidence  including the acquisition of pegaso by telef nica  we believe that we will ultimately be able to collect the remaining long term financing from pegaso 
failure to collect our finance receivables could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
leap wireless international inc in fiscal  we purchased  units of leap wireless international inc s leap wireless senior discount notes with detachable warrants for million 
the notes mature in april and bear interest at payable beginning in in addition  we hold  shares of leap wireless common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock issued to us in connection with our spin off of leap wireless in september during fiscal  we determined that declines in the market values of our investments in leap wireless were other than temporary  as the market values of the investments had declined significantly during our third quarter of fiscal as a result of unfavorable developments in leap wireless business

future accounting requirements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  business combinations  and no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations 
the provisions of fas require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
fas also requires that  upon adoption of fas  we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
fas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of fas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
fas requires that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete this step 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of fiscal any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests would be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter we will adopt the provisions of fas in our first quarter of fiscal we have determined our reporting units and the amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  other assets and liabilities allocable to those reporting units and have completed our step analysis 
based on our step analysis  the adoption of fas does not have a material impact on our financial position 
we will no longer record goodwill amortization starting in fiscal we recorded million  million and million in goodwill amortization expense during fiscal  and  respectively 
in august  the fasb issued fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas replaces fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the fasb issued fas to establish a single accounting model  based on the framework established in fas  as fas did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
fas also resolves significant implementation issues related to fas 
table of contents companies are required to adopt fas for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt fas as of the beginning of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our operating results and financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk 
we have fixed income securities consisting of cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities 
during fiscal  we invested million in diversified portfolios of non investment grade securities managed by institutional portfolio managers  which are subject to a higher degree of default risk than our investment grade fixed income portfolios 
a portion of these bonds are designated as trading securities 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about investments in marketable debt securities 
finance receivables bear interest at both fixed and variable rates see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about finance receivables 
interest earned on certain finance receivables is at variable interest rates and is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates and or libor 
fair values will vary as interest rates change 
we have other notes receivable from third parties included in other assets 
these facilities bear interest at variable rates 
interest earned on credit facilities included in other assets is affected by changes in the libor index rate  and fair value will vary as interest rates change 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

equity price market risk 
we hold marketable securities and derivative instruments subject to equity price risk 
available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments recorded at fair value under fas and fas  respectively  subject us to equity price risk 
the recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to million at september  from million at september  as of september   one equity position constituted approximately of the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
the recorded value of derivative instruments subject to fas at september  was million 
we generally invest in companies in the high technology industry  and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
the portfolio s concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio s price volatility 
we received a warrant in connection with the leap wireless spin off to purchase leap wireless common stock at per share 
at september   we were entitled to purchase  shares of leap wireless common stock see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policy for this instrument 
the warrant s remaining value at september  was insignificant  as compared to the million value at september the estimated fair value of the warrant is directly correlated to movements in the price of the leap wireless common stock 
the warrant is held for purposes other than trading 
during fiscal  we recorded million in losses on derivative instruments  primarily related to this warrant 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry  and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
during fiscal and  many high technology stocks experienced significant decreases in value  negatively affecting the fair values of our available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments 
investment concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect the overall price volatility 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities 
our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments accounted for under the equity and cost methods that are predominantly closely held and not publicly traded 
these investments are held for purposes other than trading 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
foreign exchange market risk 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of forward contracts 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations  which may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 

table of contents we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our consolidation of the v sper operating companies 
we report our financial statements in us dollars 
the v sper operating companies account for the majority of their transactions in brazilian real  and their results are translated into us dollars during and at the end of the fiscal quarter 
in addition  the v sper operating companies capital lease commitments are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  a significant change in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real could have a material effect on the v sper operating companies and on us 
a significant devaluation of the brazilian real has occurred in the past and may occur again the future 
at september   a weakening of the us dollar relative to the brazilian real would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ended september  finance receivables and notes receivable from international carriers that do not use the united states dollar as their functional currencies subject us to credit risk 
because our financing is dollar denominated  any significant change in the value of the dollar against the debtors functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor s cash flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our receivables 
at september   finance receivables from international customers totaled million 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
