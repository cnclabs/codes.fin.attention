item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting policies and estimates general in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as applied in the united states gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes and costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses commonly known as goodwill  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could affect the value of those assets  such as future economic conditions that will affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable or sell our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are based on current information available to us at the time they are made 
many of those events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and if changes in those events or circumstances occur thereafter  gaap will require us to adjust the earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs in the fair value of any of our assets 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for inventory obsolescence 
with respect to other assets  such as goodwill  we write down their fair value directly upon determining that  due to changes in events or circumstances  the amounts at which they are carried on our books exceed their current fair value 
such reserves or allowances are established  and such write downs are effectuated  by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or those write downs recorded 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or the provision of services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services 
additionally  in the case of a company that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that the company establish a reserve or allowance for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded primarily based on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and its historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe  after consultation with our independent public accountants  will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of those assets and establish adequate reserves or allowances 
additionally  as part of the audit of our annual financial statements  our independent public accountants examine  on a test basis  the evidence on which we rely  and assess the accounting principles that we use and the significant estimates that we make  in determining the amounts at which we propose to record our assets and establish our reserves in our financial statements 
see consolidated financial statements report of independent certified public accountants in item of this report 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited right of return 
we establish an allowance for potential returns which reduce the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic data  which can affect the level at which customers submit product returns 

table of contents accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we grant extended payment terms to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and current economic trends  which affects the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of the company s customers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and are reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates concerning future economic conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
allowance for deferred income taxes 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent they are available to offset or reduce our future income tax liability 
at december  the amount of that asset totaled approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of  under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  deferred tax assets relating to tax loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire if not used within specified time periods 
accordingly  the ability to use such assets depends on generating taxable income during those time periods 
as a result  we establish a valuation allowance  which is applied as a reduction of the gross amount of that deferred tax asset  to take account of the possibility that we will not generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize this asset 
in determining the amount of that allowance  we considered the taxable losses incurred in and and also current operating and economic trends as they may affect the amounts and timing of future taxable income that we currently believe we can generate 
currently available evidence leads us to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax asset that is recorded in our financial statements 
however  if due to future events or circumstances  such as an economic downturn that would adversely affect our operating results  we subsequently come to a different conclusion regarding our future taxable income and  hence  our ability to fully utilize this asset  we would increase the allowance and thereby reduce the amount at which we record the deferred tax asset 
that reduction would be effectuated by an increase in the provision or a reduction in the credit for income taxes in our statement of operations  which would have the effect of causing a decline in our operating results 
long lived assets 
long lived assets such as goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be not be recoverable 
estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are used to determine if an asset is impaired  in which case the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value 
any resulting impairment would be recorded as a charge against income in the period in which the impairment was recorded 
beginning with our fiscal year ending december   however  we will be required to assess our goodwill for impairment based on the new standards established by sfas no 
we will not be able to determine the full effect of these new standards on our financial position or our results of operations until we are able to complete our impairment analysis using the new standards 
under existing accounting standards  our assessment of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed as of december  in the event our analysis under the new standards indicates this goodwill is impaired  we will be required to record a charge to our earnings in fiscal  the amount of which is not presently determinable 
see paragraph of note a to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency 
table of contents translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
results of operations factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that the company is one the largest wholesale distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs  and boats in north america 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
our sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats which affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
weather conditions also affect the usage of rvs and boats 
additionally  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline also can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  increases in the prices of gasoline  and unusually adverse weather conditions 
we believe that increases in gasoline prices  which occurred early in  and growing uncertainties among consumers about economic conditions contributed to our poor financial performance in net sales 
net sales in declined by  or as compared to we believe that this decline was attributable to a number of factors  including rising gasoline prices in the first part of the year and uncertainties among consumers about the economy  which resulted in decreases in both the usage and purchases of recreational vehicles and boats  and the company s implementation of its new inventory management and deployment program which led to temporary disruptions in service levels to our customers 
however  most of the sales decline occurred in the first half of the year 
in the third quarter of sales declined  as compared to the corresponding quarter of and sales increased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of we believe that this reversal of our sales decline reflects an improvement in consumer confidence about the economy coupled with security concerns about foreign travel and travel by air which is causing an increase in domestic travel and  we believe  in the use of rvs  declines in interest rates and gasoline prices  and our progress in implementing our inventory management and deployment program  which has enabled us to improve our service levels to our customers 
we anticipate continued improvement in economic conditions and in the service levels we provide to our customers and  as a result  we currently expect to see further improvements  year over year  in sales in net sales in declined by approximately  or as compared to we believe that this decline  which began late in the second quarter of  was primarily attributable to increases in gasoline prices and interest rates which  coupled with growing uncertainties among consumers about the economy during the latter part of that year  resulted in a decrease in both the usage and purchase of recreational vehicles and boats and  in turn  led to a decline in purchases of our products by our customers in response to these conditions 
gross margin 
our gross margin declined to of net sales in from in this decrease was attributable to increased labor costs at our distribution facilities caused by the implementation of our new inventory management and deployment system and the relation of that increase to the decline in our sales in that decrease more than offset an overall reduction in the prices that we paid for the purchase of products from our suppliers and increases in the prices we were able to charge for selected products 
the price concessions from our suppliers were the result of costs savings we have been able to pass on to them that are attributable to our new inventory management and deployment system which has enabled us to reduce the frequency and increase the size of product shipments from them 
we believe that in we will receive continued price concessions from our suppliers and  now that the implementation of our inventory management and deployment system is substantially completed  that we will be able to reduce our labor costs at our distribution facilities  and  thereby  achieve an improvement in our gross margins from 
table of contents our gross margin declined to of net sales in from in this decline was due primarily to increased price competition in the second half of that year in response to slowing sales in our markets  the adverse effect of lower sales volume on fixed costs and a change in the mix of our sales to a higher proportion of higher priced  but lower margin accessories 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined  in absolute dollars  by or  as compared to and  despite the decline in sales in also declined as a percentage of net sales to from in these declines were due primarily to our continuing cost containment efforts  including reductions in labor costs that resulted from reductions in the number of our employees and in salaries during also contributing to the reduction in sg a expenses in was a reduction in marketing costs 
we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our organization  and anticipate that sg a expenses will again decline in  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
in  sg a increased in absolute dollars by approximately million and as a percentage of net sales to from in these increases were primarily attributable to higher selling and marketing costs  as we expanded our marine products marketing and sales efforts during  and due to expenses that we incurred in in connection the integration into our operations  and the improvements made in the functionality  of a new computer system that was installed in nearly all of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income 
the decline in operating income in was due primarily to the combined effects of the decreases in sales and gross margin  which more than offset the reduction in sg a expenses 
the decline in operating income in was due primarily to the combined effects of the decreases in sales and gross margin and the increase in sg a expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense in decreased by  or as compared to this decrease was the result of reductions in interest rates during  and reductions in average long term borrowings outstanding during the year that were made possible  in part  by inventory reductions that we were able to implement as a result of our new inventory management and deployment system 
during  interest expense increased by  or  as compared to this increase was primarily the result of increases in average long term borrowings outstanding during the first nine months of  which were used to fund operations and to fund repurchases of shares of our common stock in the latter half of and  to a lesser extent  due to increases in interest rates during other income 
other income in was primarily attributable to the sale of the real property where our distribution center in portland  oregon was located 
that distribution center was relocated  following that sale  to a leased facility in the portland area 
other income in was the result of a one time sale of one of our proprietary product lines to a recreational vehicle supplies manufacturer  which has agreed to supply that product  along with products from its other product lines  to us in future periods 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  which expires in may  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  with seasonal reductions ranging from  to  between august and february of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and between to of eligible inventory 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at the bank s libor rate  plus percent 

table of contents at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and rank senior in priority to other indebtedness of the company 
our revolving credit facility expires on may  as a result  commencing in the second quarter of  our bank borrowings  which are currently classified as a long term liability  will have to be reclassified as a short term liability until such time as we are able to obtain a new long term credit facility 
we currently believe that we have good relations with our bank lender and  if our operating results in improve  as we currently expect they will  we believe we will be able to obtain a renewal or extension of our existing credit agreement with our current lender or obtain a new credit facility with a new lender 
if  however  our operating results should deteriorate  or economic conditions or conditions in the credit markets were to worsen  our costs of borrowing could increase in  or we could experience difficulties renewing our existing or obtaining a new credit facility 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with day  net day terms 
during late fall and winter  however  certain of our customers receive extended payment terms 
we were largely successful in late in securing similar extended payment terms from some of our suppliers  which reduced the amounts we had to borrow under our credit facility to make inventory purchases 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain extended payment terms from our suppliers in the future 
if we are unable to do so  it would require us to incur additional borrowings under our credit facility or could adversely affect our ability to timely pay our creditors and to purchase inventory 
also  in the event our customers delay their payments to us  our payments to our creditors could also be delayed 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases for the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in  as compared to  in and  in the increase in cash provided by operations in was primarily attributable to an increase of  in our accounts payable as a result of obtaining extended payment terms from our suppliers 
during  we received  from the sale of our portland  oregon distribution facility 
we have leased a smaller facility in nearby wilsonville  oregon 
capital expenditures were  in as compared to  in and  in capital expenditures in and were primarily related to the acquisition and installation of the company s new computer system in and improvements made in its functionality during borrowings under our credit facility decreased by  in and by  in  and increased  in we also repaid  in other long term debt in  the majority of which was owed on the mortgage for our portland  oregon distribution facility 
in june  we made the final payment  in the amount of  on our outstanding senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our credit facility 
in early  we began an open market and private stock repurchase program and  during  we purchased  of shares of our common stock  also using borrowings under our credit facility 
we do not currently expect to make any purchases of shares during we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  our future lease commitments are described in note d of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from april through september than we do during the remainder of the year 
because a substantial portion of the company s expenses are fixed  operating income declines and the company sometimes incurs losses and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements in months when sales are lower 

table of contents the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with the our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximate the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant 

table of contents certain factors that could affect future performance statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations regarding our future operations or future financial performance or trends in our business constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are estimates of future performance or our future financial condition that are based upon current information and that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results or our financial performance or condition in future periods to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following our business is seasonal and is subject to various economic and climatic influences 
our sales are affected directly by the purchase and usage levels of rvs and boats 
the purchase and  in particular  the usage of rvs and boats  are affected by weather conditions 
as a result  our sales and operating results ordinarily decline in the winter months and we sometimes incur losses in these periods of the year 
additionally  unusual weather conditions in a particular season  such as unusually cold weather in the spring or summer months  can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
purchases and usage of rvs and boats also are affected by consumers level of discretionary income and their confidence about economic conditions and changes in interest rates and in the availability and cost of gasoline 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by the following loss of confidence among consumers regarding economic conditions and the onset of economic recessions  which affect the willingness of consumers to purchase and use their rvs and boats  increases in interest rates which affect the availability and affordability of financing for rvs and boats  increases in the costs and supply shortages of gasoline which affect the costs of using and the ability to use rvs and boats  and unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions  which can reduce the usage of rv and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions 
these conditions also often lead to increased price competition in our markets which could force us to reduce our prices  thereby reducing sales revenue and our margins 
these conditions contributed to the decline in our sales and the losses we incurred in the years ended december  and and could impact our operating results in the future 
we have financed our growth primarily with and rely heavily on bank borrowings 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our outstanding borrowings could harm us in the future 
we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund expansion or take advantage of other business opportunities  and we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt 
therefore  our existing debt makes us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and competitive pressures and  as discussed in the section of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the interest we have to pay on such debt impacts our operating results 
our credit facility expires on may  our credit facility  which is our principal source of borrowings to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures will expire in approximately months  on may  we may encounter difficulties obtaining a renewal or extension of our existing credit facility from our existing lender or a new credit facility from a new lender to replace the existing credit facility and  even if we are able to do so  our costs of borrowing may increase 
the effects of possible changes in supply relationships in our markets 
as is the customary practice in our markets  in most instances we do not have long term supply contracts with our product suppliers 
as a result  product suppliers are free to change the terms on which they will sell us products or to discontinue supplying us with products altogether  because they may choose to distribute their products directly to after market dealers or because they might choose to establish exclusive supply relationships with other distributors 
additionally  manufacturers of new rvs and boats may choose to incorporate optional equipment on their rvs and boats at the time of manufacture that  historically were provided to their dealers by distributors such as the company 
any of these occurrences 
table of contents could result in increased competition in our markets or reduce the number of products we are able to offer our customers  which could cause our sales to decline and could result in lower margins 
additional uncertainties are discussed in the section of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including  in particular  in the introductory portion thereof that discusses our accounting policies and estimates and the effects those policies and estimates can have on our future financial position and operating results 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking information contained in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
