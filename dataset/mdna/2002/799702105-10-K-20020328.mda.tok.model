critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates include revenue recognition matters  determining the estimated lives of our processing contracts and determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
for sanchez software license contracts  a determination needs to be made for each contract regarding whether the percentage of completion contract accounting method should be used to recognize revenue or whether revenue can be recognized when the software is delivered and all of the conditions of the american institute of certified public accountants  statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  are met 
contract accounting is required if our services are essential to the arrangement 
in many cases  our services are essential to the arrangement because they involve customization and interfaces  and our license fees are paid in stages based on the completion of defined service deliverables 
as a result  we typically recognize revenue from these arrangements using contract accounting  which generally results in recording revenue over a longer period of time 
in other cases  our services are not essential to the arrangement  such as arrangements where an unrelated third party performs implementation services and the realization of our license fee is not dependent on the completion of such services 
in these situations  we recognize license fees when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software is delivered  our fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable  which generally results in recording revenue earlier than when contract accounting is used 
the determination of whether our services are essential involves significant judgment and could have a material impact on our quarterly results of operations to the extent that significant new contracts are not accounted for using contract accounting 
under the percentage of completion contract accounting method  the company recognizes revenue from the entire arrangement based on the percentage of costs incurred related to the implementation and development services compared to the total cost of such services 
using the percentage of completion method requires management to make estimates about the future costs of services  which are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
a change in these estimates could result in a material adjustment to the amount of revenue recorded under an arrangement 
the company s e profile outsourced projects generate both product license revenues and implementation related service revenues  which in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  are largely deferred during the implementation phase along with the related costs until the client begins processing its customer s accounts on the outsourced platform 
once a client goes live  the deferred revenue and costs are amortized over the expected life of the processing arrangement 
until we have more historical experience related to the actual term of processing arrangements  we have determined that the expected life of the arrangements does not exceed their contractual term 
as it becomes apparent that a client will renew its processing term  the expected life is extended prospectively 
to date  the contract terms have ranged from one to three years 
should a client terminate early  all revenue and cost would be recognized as of the termination date  if the amount is determinable and collection probable  which could be significant 
a change in the expected life of the contact could have a material impact on the timing of future revenue and margin recognized from the amortization of deferred implementation and license fees 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the majority of the company s receivables are due from financial service organizations located throughout the united states  europe and canada 
from time to time  our clients dispute the amounts due to us and in other cases our clients experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectable accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectable accounts involves significant judgment 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customer as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors  the ultimate settlement of disputes and  in certain cases  the decisions of third party arbitrators or courts

should the company s business expand more rapidly than expected  the company believes that additional capital  if necessary  would be available to fund such operating and capital requirements 
the company believes that its business is generally not seasonal  however  the company has historically experienced  and can be expected to continue to experience  a certain degree of variability in its quarterly revenue  earnings and cash flow patterns 
this variability is typically driven by significant events  which directly impact the recognition and billing of project related revenues 
examples of such events include the timing of new business contract closings and the initiation of product and service fee revenue recognition  one time payments from existing clients relative to license expansion rights required to process a greater number of customer accounts or expand the number of permitted users and completion of implementation project roll outs and the related revenue recognition 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client projects  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that over the course of time the ongoing monthly revenue stream associated with the e profile outsourcing operation will contribute toward more predictable quarter to quarter revenues
