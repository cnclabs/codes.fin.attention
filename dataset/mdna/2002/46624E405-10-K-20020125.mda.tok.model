item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company has exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to interest rate changes under its revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility bears interest at rates which vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
the company does not speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
currently  all of the company s debt bears interest at the day libor rate plus an applicable margin based upon the company s debt to ebitda ratio 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would not be material 
raw material price risk 
a portion of the company s raw materials are commodities and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties  and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
in most cases  essential raw materials are available from several sources 
for several raw materials  however  branded goods or other circumstances may prevent such diversification and an interruption of the supply of these raw materials could have a significant impact on the company s ability to produce certain products 
the company has established long term relationships with key suppliers and may enter into purchase contracts or commitments of one year or less for certain raw materials 
such agreements generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the contract or commitment 
the company believes that any changes in raw material pricing  which cannot be adjusted for by changes in its product pricing or other strategies  would not be significant 
general economic conditions 
demand for the company s products is affected by a variety of economic factors including  but not limited to  the cyclical nature of the construction industry  demand for electronic and aerospace products which ultimately utilize components manufactured by the company  and general consumer demand 
adverse economic developments could affect the financial performance of the company
