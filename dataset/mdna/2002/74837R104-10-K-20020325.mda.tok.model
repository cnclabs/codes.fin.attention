item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report on form k and other materials we file with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements may relate to a variety of matters not currently ascertainable  such as future capital expenditures  drilling activity  acquisitions and dispositions  development or exploratory activities  cost savings efforts  production activities and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  financing plans  liquidity  regulatory matters  competition and our ability to realize efficiencies related to certain transactions or organizational changes 
forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  expect  intend  plan  project  potential  or similar statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements include fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  failure or delays in achieving expected production from oil and gas development projects  uncertainties inherent in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance  the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations  liability resulting from litigation  world economic and political conditions  changes in tax and other laws applicable to our business and certain factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this section 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and other our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates described below 
we believe the reported financial results are reliable and that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported 
oil and gas properties we employ the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas production assets 
under the full cost method all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs is depleted on the unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of related deferred tax or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of i estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on unescalated year end prices and costs  ii the cost of properties not being amortized  iii the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less iv income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and gas properties 
future price declines  higher operating costs or additional capitalized costs without incremental increases in oil and gas reserves could result in the write down of net capitalized costs to the cost center ceiling 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates are subject to change over time as additional information becomes available 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to the product transfers to purchasers 
we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for oil and natural gas production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of oil and gas production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our expectation of actual deliveries and actual prices received 
hedging we enter into financial derivative instruments to hedge risk associated with the prices received from oil and gas production and marketing 
we also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest on our debt outstanding 
every derivative instrument is recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
generally  the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
the ineffective portion of hedges is recognized currently in earnings 
accounting and disclosure rules relating to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges require us to increase our reported stockholders equity when future gas prices are forecasted to decrease relative to the strike price in our hedges  and to decrease our reported stockholders equity when future gas prices increase relative to the strike price in our hedges 
the change in reported stockholders equity relates only to our hedged production 
you should be aware that future declines in gas prices are not beneficial to us since less than of our production is hedged and even though hedge accounting rules require us to increase our book value 
income taxes included in our net deferred tax liability is  of future tax benefits from prior unused tax losses 
realization of these tax assets depends on sufficient future taxable income before the benefits expire 
we believe we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry forward benefits before they expire  however  if not  we could be required to recognize a loss for some or all of these tax assets 
internal revenue code section income tax benefits are due to expire at the end of unless new legislation extends the benefits  our income will be lower starting in during and  we recorded revenue of  and  respectively  from section benefits and anticipate recording  in from these credits 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees 
the companies that we have an equity investment in do not have any significant debts 
other our hedging activity coupled with our long term gas sales contracts has resulted in gas revenue that reflects approximately of our gas sales volumes realized at fixed prices 
the remainder of our hydrocarbon volumes are sold at market prices 
future commodity price declines will negatively impact future income and cash flow to the extent of any production sold at market prices 
these declines could ultimately affect the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves and cost center ceiling values 
these results  individually or collectively  could result in bank debt default and or debt acceleration  restrict our ability to attract qualified personnel or cause further industry consolidation 
geographic and product concentration may negatively impact our operations 
we are concentrated in michigan  which is a mature basin  and sell primarily natural gas 
regulations promulgated by the state of michigan may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to gas producers in other locations 
in addition  we produce of our natural gas from the garfield field in michigan 
due to the significance of this one field  disruptions could reduce our financial results 
our stock price may be negatively impacted by large block sales by major shareholders 
members of the darden family own over of our common stock outstanding  however  the dardens have indicated they have no current intention of disposing of any of their holdings 
acquisitions cms acquisition on march   we acquired from cms oil and gas company  a subsidiary of cms energy corporation  oil and gas properties located primarily in michigan cms properties or cms acquisition 
the purchase price  which was finalized in november  was million 
the cms properties consist of interests in approximately  net producing oil and gas wells 
estimated proved reserves attributed to the cms properties included bcf of natural gas  mbbls of crude oil and condensate and mbbls of natural gas liquids  or a total of bcfe 
approximately of the proved reserve volumes were classified as proved developed 
the cms acquisition was financed through restructuring of our senior bank facility  the sale of million in subordinated notes  and the monetization  through a major financial institution  of a portion of the accompanying internal revenue code section income tax credits related to the cms properties 
the cms acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method  and consisted of both cms oil and gas properties and of the common stock of terra energy ltd 
mercury acquisition effective july   we purchased substantially all of the oil and gas related assets of  and of a gas compression company  from mercury exploration company mercury  a related party  for approximately million 
an independent appraiser determined the fairness  from a financial point of view  of the million purchase price  and the non related party members of the board of directors approved the purchase 
the acquisition was financed through assumption of existing debt of million  application of an account receivable of million  a note payable to mercury of million and accounts payable of million 
dominion indiana acquisition effective april   we purchased substantially all of the interests in producing gas wells  related gathering systems and fifty percent in undeveloped leasehold acres owned by dominion reserves indiana  inc dominion for million 
we acquired the remaining interests in these properties located in indiana and kentucky from mercury effective july  mgv energy inc minority interest acquisition on december   we acquired the remaining minority interest in our canadian subsidiary  mgv energy inc  mgv headquartered in calgary  alberta 
our initial interest in mgv was acquired on august  in exchange for their interest  the minority shareholders of mgv received the equivalent of  shares of our common stock in the form of mgv exchangeable shares valued at  which was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair value

an additional  mcf were attributable to prior year production payouts identified during capital expenditures for drilling  recompletions and workovers in resulted in a  mcf increase in sales volumes 
these increases were offset by natural production declines on existing production

the prior deferred tax balance was recorded at since it was previously estimated that the timing differences would reverse at the lower rate 
the increase in our profitability from the cms acquisition and record high prices will result in future taxable income at the rate 
in   of income taxes that would otherwise have been due were eliminated because of the utilization of net operating losses available from prior years 
as of december   we had a deferred tax liability of  the increase in the deferred tax liability over the december  balance includes  as a result of the cms acquisition and a  reduction in the liability that resulted from the acquisition of the mercury assets effective july  the remainder of the increase is the result of year deferred tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources general the following discussion compares our financial condition at december  and for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  were spent on acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the capital program was financed from operations  additional borrowings  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
internal revenue code section income tax benefits are due to expire at the end of  and  unless new legislation extends the benefits  our income will be lower starting in during and  we recorded revenue of  and  respectively from section benefits and anticipate recording revenue of  in of these amounts    and  represent cash payments for  and estimated  respectively 
cash flow we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our business 
we anticipate our capital expenditure budget of approximately  will be funded by cash flow from operations  stock warrants exercised and credit facility utilization 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
we have a credit facility  which is a three year revolving facility that matures on march  and permits us to obtain revolving credit loans and to issue letters of credit for our account from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed  the current borrowing base is  and is subject to semi annual determination and certain other redeterminations based upon a variety of factors  including the discounted present value of estimated future net cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil production 
the next scheduled re determination date will be as of may   based on december  assets and proved reserves 
at our option  loans may be prepaid  and revolving credit commitments may be reduced in whole or in part at any time in minimum amounts 
as of year end  we can designate the interest rate on amounts outstanding at either the london interbank offered rate libor or bank prime rate 
at december   our interest rate was through april  on million 
the collateral for the credit facility consists of substantially all of our existing assets and any future reserves acquired 
the loan agreements prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends by us and contain other restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require the maintenance of a minimum current ratio 
we currently are in compliance with all such restrictions 
at december   we had  available under the credit facility 
our principal operating sources of cash include sales of natural gas and crude oil and revenues from transportation and processing 
we sell approximately of our natural gas production under long term  fixed price contracts and swap agreements 
as a result  we benefit from significant predictability of our natural gas revenues 
commodity market prices affect cash flow for that portion of natural gas not under contract as well as our crude oil sales 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase resulted from higher earnings and increased working capital from operations 
net cash used in investing for the year ended december  was  investing activities were comprised primarily of additions to oil and gas properties through development expenditures of  exploration expenditures of  and property acquisitions of  included in exploratory expenditures were  for our share of the pancanadian and conoco coal bed methane projects 
net cash from financing activities for the year ended december  was  cash of  was received from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options 
borrowings under our credit facility increased by  and were partially offset by various other note and loan repayments of  resulting in net additional borrowings of  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt     operating leases      gas purchase obligation   other total obligation      long term debt we have a credit facility  which is a three year revolving facility that matures on march  this facility permits us to obtain revolving credit loans and to issue letters of credit for our account from time to time  in an aggregate amount not to exceed  we had  outstanding as of december  under the credit facility 
the remaining long term debt consists of subordinated notes of  and various other notes of  operating leases we lease office buildings and other property under operating leases 
gas purchase obligation cinnabar energy services and trading llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  has an index based contract to purchase  mcf day from november through march cinnabar also has index based sales contracts for these volumes through march that yield a net margin for the product purchased 
we have the following commercial commitments as of december  amounts of commitments expiration per period less total than after commercial commitments committed year years years years in thousands canadian coal bed methane development   standby letters of credit total commitments   canadian coal bed methane development we have minimum drilling commitments under operating agreements with joint venture partners

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization  including internal controls 
the level of risk assumed by us is based on our objectives and capacity to manage risk 
our primary risk exposure is related to natural gas commodity prices 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of swaps  futures and forward contracts  however  we have also limited future gains from favorable movements 
commodity price risk we enter into various sales and financial contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas production 
these contracts have included physical sales contracts and financial contracts including price ceilings and floors  no cost collars and fixed price swaps 
as of december   we sell approximately  mcfd and  mcfd of natural gas under long term fixed price contracts at mcf and mcf  respectively  through march approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts during the remaining  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
additionally  we have hedged approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production using fixed price swap agreements at prices averaging per mcf 
these agreements expire from april to april as a result of these various contracts  we benefit from significant predictability of our natural gas revenues 
the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of december  related to natural gas production

up to  mcfd of natural gas is committed at market price through may additional natural gas volumes of  mcfd are committed at market price through september during  approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts 
an additional  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
cinnabar energy services trading  llc cinnabar  our wholly owned marketing company  also enters into various financial contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk associated with future contractual natural gas sales and purchases 
these contracts include either fixed and floating price sales or purchases from third parties 
as a result of these firm sales and purchase commitments and associated financial price swaps  the hedge derivatives have qualified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in  of net gains recorded to other revenue for at december   we have recorded an asset of  for the fair value of the firm sales commitments 
additionally  we have recorded current assets of  and current liabilities of  associated with the fair value of the financial fixed and floating price swaps 
the following table summarizes cinnabar s open financial derivative positions and hedged firm commitments as of december  related to natural gas marketing

as a result of the hedging programs  revenues from production were lower than if the hedging program had not been in effect by  in   in and  in marketing revenues were  lower as a result of hedging activities in the fair value of fixed price and floating price natural gas financial contracts and associated firm sales commitments as of december  was estimated based on published market prices of natural gas for the periods covered by the contracts 
the net differential between the prices in each contract and market prices for future periods  as adjusted for estimated basis  has been applied to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
as a result  the natural gas financial swap and firm sales commitment fair value does not necessarily represent the value a third party would pay to assume our contract positions based on the financial fixed price hedge positions  for each per mcf increase in the price of natural gas  our annualized revenue would increase by approximately  of which  would be reduced due to the existing hedges 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure associated with interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
as of december   we have hedged  of our variable rate debt and  of our fixed rate second mortgage notes subordinated notes 
as of december    of the variable rate debt is hedged with interest rate swaps converting the debt s floating libor base to a fixed rate resulting in a liability of  in november  we entered into an interest rate swap covering the  of fixed rate subordinated notes 
the swap converts the debt s fixed rate debt to a floating three month libor base resulting in an asset of  as of december  we have revalued the subordinated notes to offset the fair value of the swap as required by sfas no 
if interest rates on our  variable debt increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pretax income will decrease or increase by  interest expense for the year ended december  was  higher as a result of the interest rate swaps 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counter parties of their contractual obligations 
we sell our oil and gas production directly under long term contracts and through cinnabar to creditworthy counter parties  such as utilities  major oil companies or their affiliates  industrial customers  large trading companies or energy marketing companies  refineries and other users of petroleum products 
we monitor exposure to counter parties by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and credit service reports 
exposure levels are limited and parental guarantees are required according to our established policy 
in this manner  we reduce credit risk 
performance risk performance risk results when a financial counter party fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
we manage performance risk through management of credit risk 
each customer and or counter party is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk
