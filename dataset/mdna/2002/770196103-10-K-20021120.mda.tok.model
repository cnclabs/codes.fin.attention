item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the pharmaceutical  energy and industrial markets worldwide 
our principal brand names pfaudler  moyno  chemineer  laetus  frymakoruma  siebler  hapa and hercules hold the number one or two market share position in the niche markets they serve 
we operate in three market focused business segments pharmaceutical  energy and industrial 
during the past five years  our strategy has been to increase our focus on high growth markets  such as pharmaceutical and energy  and to broaden our international presence 
in furtherance of this strategy  on august   we acquired romaco  a european based manufacturer of processing  dosing  filling  printing and security equipment for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries 
our acquisition of romaco  which had sales of approximately million in our fiscal  expands the breadth of our pharmaceutical capabilities and positions us as a leading supplier of primary and secondary processing equipment to the growing pharmaceutical market 
with the addition of romaco  our international sales increased to approximately of fiscal sales from of our fiscal sales 
the total purchase price of romaco was million 
at closing in fiscal  we paid consideration of million as follows million in cash  million in a five year subordinated note  the assumption of net debt of million and  of our common shares valued at million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we made an additional payment based on romaco s sales and operating performance for calendar year of million  half of which was in cash and half of which was in a five year subordinated note 
we also incurred acquisition costs of million in fiscal we completed the romaco acquisition as of the end of fiscal  and  therefore  the acquisition had no impact on our results of operations in fiscal pro forma result references throughout this discussion give effect to the romaco acquisition as if it were made at the beginning of fiscal we recorded special items in fiscal and that impacted the comparability of certain information 
we did not incur any special charges in fiscal the special items that were recorded in fiscal and were as follows special items ebit impact net income per pharma net diluted ceutical industrial energy corporate total income share in thousands  except per share data global reorganization costs plant closure costs gain on sale of building uge long term receivable write down 
table of contents in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a global reorganization program to consolidate operations in england  mexico and the asia pacific regions to strengthen our market presence and achieve more effective channels to market 
in addition  we discontinued certain product offerings in our chemineer and moyno businesses to improve our long term competitive position through a more cost effective product focus 
we incurred a one time charge of million  million of which related to severance and other costs associated with the regional consolidations and the balance of which related to inventory write downs from discontinued product offerings 
there were additional costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal totalling million that we expensed as incurred primarily for equipment relocation  marketing and employee training 
as of august   we had paid all costs related to the global reorganization program  without any changes in estimates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to reduce a long term receivable related to uge  which is owned by us and owned by universal process equipment  inc the charge was due to weakness in the used glass lined reactor and storage vessel markets served by uge 
in fiscal  due to the downturn in the energy business segment at that time  we analyzed our capacity requirements for our energy products 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million for the closure and relocation of our fairfield  california manufacturing operation 
we incurred additional expenses related to the fairfield plant closure of million in fiscal these costs were for employee transfers  equipment relocation and training of new employees at the texas facility 
we sold the fairfield facility in july  resulting in a pretax gain of million

table of contents total sales adjusted ebita adjusted ebita ebit ebit adjusted ebita represents ebit before amortization and special items  which are described in the special items table in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis 
adjusted ebita is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales for fiscal were million compared with million in the same period of the prior year 
on a pro forma basis  taking into account the romaco acquisition  sales decreased million  or the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal on a pro forma basis  the pharmaceutical segment sales increased million  or 
overall  this sales increase was due to the strengthening of the euro against the dollar 
romaco s sales increased by million compared with their pro forma fiscal sales due to the strength of the pharmaceutical and healthcare markets 
however  offsetting this was decreased reactor systems sales of million 
the decline in reactor systems sales was due to the impact of the weak specialty chemical market and slow industrial economy in the us the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
lower crude oil and natural gas prices caused a reduction in exploration and production activities in fiscal compared with fiscal the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
this segment was also negatively impacted by the slow industrial economy in the us ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required that goodwill no longer be amortized 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a million reduction in amortization in fiscal adjusted ebita ebit before amortization and special items  which are described in the special items table in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the pharmaceutical segment had an adjusted ebita of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal on a pro forma basis  the pharmaceutical segment adjusted ebita in fiscal increased by 
million over the prior year period 
the energy segment had an adjusted ebita of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in energy segment sales reduced adjusted ebita by million 
the remaining decrease was due to increased research and development costs and a change in sales mix from higher margin exploration products to lower margin wellhead products 
the industrial segment had an adjusted ebita of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a reduction of million  while sales decreased by million 
the reduction was due to lower overall sales volumes and reduced selling prices resulting from the weak markets into which this segment sells 
adjusted ebita was also negatively impacted by the mix of products sold as the volume of high margin industrial pump aftermarket products declined significantly 

table of contents interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisition of romaco 
our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared with in fiscal net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily related to us operations 
net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the decrease was due to the weak market conditions and resulting lower sales volumes in the energy and industrial segments in fiscal interest costs were also higher due to debt incurred for the romaco acquisition  however  overall the romaco acquisition was accretive 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales of million in fiscal were million higher than fiscal  a increase 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the weakening of the euro and  to a lesser extent  the british pound had a negative translation effect on sales for the year of million 
excluding this translation effect  sales were higher than the prior year 
the energy segment sales were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal this increase in fiscal sales was million  or 
high natural gas and crude oil prices spurred an increase in exploration and production activities 
the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the weakening of the british pound had a negative translation effect on fiscal sales of million 
excluding this translation effect  sales were higher than the prior year 
the increase in fiscal sales was attributable to an increase in demand for our corrosion resistant products in the semiconductor market 
ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the adjusted ebita in fiscal was million compared with million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
in the pharmaceutical segment  adjusted ebita was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the weakening european currencies against the us dollar decreased adjusted ebita by million in fiscal the remaining decline was attributable to lower sales in reactor systems  which was due to the aforementioned low profitability and capital spending in the chemical process industry and the weak euro creating competitive pressures for our uk operations 
in the energy segment  adjusted ebita was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in adjusted ebita was due to the sales volume increase and the cost reductions from closing the fairfield facility 
in the industrial segment  adjusted ebita was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline was due to selling price pressures in our chemineer business and a higher mix of low margin sales to municipalities by our moyno business 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower average debt levels in fiscal and slightly lower interest rates during fiscal our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal tax rate was lower since we generated a tax benefit from our foreign sales corporation 
net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily related to us operations 

table of contents net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the increase was primarily from the sales increase in the energy segment 
excluding the effects of the special items described in the special items table in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis  fiscal net income and net income per diluted share would have been higher by million and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was million compared with million in fiscal the improved cash flow from operations was due to our actions to conserve cash in reaction to the expected weaker economic environment in fiscal because of these actions  inventories were reduced by million  excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the decrease in accrued expenses primarily related to lower variable pay accruals  income tax accruals and customer advance payments 
we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund the fiscal year operating needs  scheduled debt services  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures of approximately million 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  cost reductions and replacement items 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal we also generated cash of million through sale leaseback arrangements 
during fiscal  we paid million in earnout payments and acquisition costs related to the romaco acquisition  and we paid million for refinancing fees in connection with the amended credit agreement discussed below 
financing activities we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement agreement on january  this agreement provided for borrowings on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million 
in june of  we received net proceeds of approximately million from a secondary stock offering 
the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
the agreement states that the banks commitment under the agreement is also reduced by the amount of the gross proceeds from a stock offering 
therefore  subsequent to the stock offering  the banks commitment under the agreement was reduced to million 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on january  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or prime  at our option  and is payable at least quarterly 
under the agreement and other lines of credit  we have million of unused borrowing capacity 
however  due to our financial covenants  at august   we could only incur additional indebtedness of million 
subsequent to august   the agreement was amended which eased the thresholds for our interest coverage and leverage ratios 
with the amended financial covenants  we could incur additional indebtedness of approximately million 
we have million of convertible subordinated notes that are due on september  fiscal year 
we are pursuing various options regarding the payment of these notes 
if necessary  we can use our capacity under the agreement to repay these notes  because utilizing borrowings under the agreement to retire these notes would not create additional debt and therefore not impact our position with regard to debt covenants 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty accruals  litigation  product liability and environmental accruals and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
retirement benefit obligations are affected by a number of estimates made by us in consultation with independent actuaries  including the discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets and assumed increases for wage rate and health care costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill as of september   we adopted two new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board 
sfas no 
 business combinations  eliminated the pooling method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and addressed the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
accordingly  we applied the provisions of sfas no 
to all business combinations initiated after june  we also adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september  goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption of the standard  and the required impairment tests were performed 
results of these impairment tests have not generated any impairment loss to date 

table of contents goodwill will be tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  are performed at the end of our first quarter 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and over foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us as of august   the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
at august   we had entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million was at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of our debt obligations at august  by maturity dates in thousands  except percents 
table of contents us dollar us dollar non us dollar non us dollar fixed rate variable rate fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value in the normal course of business  we issue letters of credit to secure outstanding debt and certain payments to vendors 
at august   we have outstanding letters of credit of million that are all due within one year 
in addition to long term debt obligations  we have commitments under non cancellable operating leases with the following maturities in thousands thereafter we have no capital lease obligations or unconditional purchase obligations
