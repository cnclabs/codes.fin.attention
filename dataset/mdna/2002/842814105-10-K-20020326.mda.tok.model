item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in december  the us securities and exchange commission the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in the managements discussion and analysis 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that its accounting policies described below fit this definition installment contracts receivable the majority of the installment contracts receivable is from borrowers in the southern portion of the united states and is collateralized by manufactured homes and real estate 
foreclosed installment contracts receivable that are not liquidated are written down to an estimated recoverable amount and reclassified as collateral held for resale and included in inventories 
the allowance for credit losses is established to provide for losses inherent in the installment contracts receivable portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is determined based on the company s historical loss experience after adjusting for current economic conditions 
management  after assessing the loss experience and economic conditions  adjusts the allowance account through periodic provisions 
actual credit losses are charged to the allowance when realized 
product warranties the company warrants its products against certain manufacturing defects for a period of one year commencing at the time of retail sale 
the estimated cost of such warranties is accrued at the time of sale to the independent dealer based on historical warranty costs incurred 
periodic adjustments to the accrual will be made as events occur that indicate changes are necessary 
litigation the company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its business 
the company typically issues a one year warranty on new manufactured homes 
the majority of these legal proceedings are claims related to warranty on manufactured homes or employment issues such as workers compensation claims 
management believes that adequate reserves are maintained for such claims 
in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the company  however  the ultimate resolution of these matters  which could occur within one year  could result in losses in excess of the amounts reserved 
insurance arrangements the company is partially self insured for workers compensation and health insurance claims 
the company purchases insurance coverage for all workers compensation claims in excess of  per occurrence  and for all health care claims in excess of  per occurrence  with an annual aggregate stop loss limit of approximately million for all claims 
amounts are accrued currently for the estimated costs of claims incurred  including related expenses 
management considers accrued liabilities for unsettled claims to be adequate 
however  there is no assurance that the amounts accrued will not vary from the ultimate amounts incurred upon final disposition of all outstanding claims 
as a result  periodic adjustments to the reserves will be made as events occur which indicate changes are necessary 
repurchase agreements substantially all of the company s independent dealers finance their purchases through floor plan arrangements under which a financial institution provides the dealer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral 
in connection with a floor plan arrangement  the financial institution which provides the independent dealer financing customarily requires the company to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution  under which the company is obligated  upon default by the independent dealer  to repurchase the homes at the company s original invoice price plus certain administrative and shipping expenses 
repurchases were million  million  and million  for the years ended   and  respectively 
at december   the company s contingent repurchase liability under floor plan financing arrangements through independent dealers was approximately million 
while homes that have been repurchased by the company under floor plan financing arrangements are usually sold to other dealers  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell to other dealers homes that it may be obligated to repurchase in the future under such floor plan financing arrangements or that the company will not suffer losses with respect to  and as a consequence of  those arrangements 
results of operations general the manufactured housing industry as a whole has been adversely affected by various economic factors  and has struggled during most of the past three years 
rapid industry growth over the years preceding this three year period resulted in an increase in the overall number of dealers  an increase in manufacturing output and an increase in the number of homes available at the retail level 
these larger inventories and the generally slower reduction of those inventories has led to increased price competition and reduced profits 
tightening credit has compounded the situation and negatively affected the industry s overall financial performance  with virtually all manufacturers and retailers being negatively affected 
while the company is still experiencing the negative economic factors influencing financial performance of the entire manufactured housing industry  it has taken a number of steps that have been effective in implementing its plans to decrease costs and improve efficiency 
in and  these steps included closing less efficient manufacturing facilities  consolidating divisions  and selling unprofitable retail centers  as well as improving efficiency in the remaining manufacturing plants  lowering labor costs and turnover  decreasing plant injuries  and lowering warranty expenses by improved quality 
the company s modest gain in net revenues during the last quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year is considered by management to be an encouraging sign of improvement 
weak market conditions still persist  however  including industry wide excess retail inventory and more restrictive retail financing conditions for consumers  and management plans to remain attentive to its focus on being responsive to changing industry conditions and believes that it is positioned to implement further measures as necessary to respond to those changes

the following discussion about the company s interest rate risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk 
historically the company has not entered into derivatives contracts to either hedge existing risk or for speculative purposes 
the company also does not and has not entered into contracts involving derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
pertinent provisions of regulation s k call for disclosures to clarify exposures to market risk associated with activities in derivative financial instruments  other financials instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the regulation defines other financial instruments to include trade accounts receivable  loans and structured notes 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments to manage such risks 
the company s principal credit agreement bears a floating interest rate of over prime 
accordingly  the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   the principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement was million 
assuming that amount outstanding  a increase in the applicable interest rate during would result in additional interest expense of approximately  which would reduce cash flow and pre tax earnings dollar for dollar 
accounts receivable most of the company s sales of manufactured homes are pre sold  such that orders exist before construction begins 
when manufactured homes are sold to dealers as inventory  such homes are paid for by dealer s floor plan financing  such that funds ordinarily transfer to the company from the dealer s floor plan lender within days 
management thus does not perceive that the company is subject to a material market risk with respect to its accounts receivable
