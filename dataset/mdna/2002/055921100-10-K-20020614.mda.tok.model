item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section includes historical information  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others 
it is important that the business discussion in item of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  acquired in process research and development  intangible assets  deferred tax assets and marketable securities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
the critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments listed above are discussed further throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings loss as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties 
acquisitions in april  we acquired new dimension software ltd 
new dimension in a cash tender offer 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  new dimension s financial results have been included in our fiscal financial results since the acquisition date 
in april  we acquired evity  inc evity for million shares of common stock and cash of million 
stock options to purchase million common shares were issued to replace outstanding evity stock options 
in august  we acquired optisystems solutions  ltd 
optisystems for cash 
these transactions  along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions  were accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss bear to total revenues

we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
in applying these statements  we recognize software license fees upon meeting the following four criteria execution of the signed contract  delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer  determination that the software license fees are fixed and determinable  and determination that collection of the software license fees is probable 
in instances when any one of the four criteria are not met  we will either defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met or will recognize the software license revenue on a ratable basis  as required by sops and maintenance  enhancement and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis 
revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
we have an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
further  the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity 
revenues from sales through agents  distributors and resellers are recorded either at the gross amount charged the customer or net of commissions paid  based on the economic risks and ongoing product support responsibilities we assume 
revenues from professional services are typically recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts  or on a percentage of completion basis 
when several elements  including software licenses  maintenance  enhancement and support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenues from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based upon the residual method  whereby the fair value of the undelivered elements of the contract is deferred 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance  enhancement and support and professional services 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services  and where the maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
in those instances where professional services are essential to the functionality of the software licenses  contract accounting is applied to both the software license and services elements of the arrangement 
in the event a contract contains terms which are inconsistent with our vendor specific objective evidence  all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis 
based on our interpretation of sop and sop  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions license north america international total license revenues  maintenance north america international total maintenance revenues professional services north america international total professional services revenues total revenues    the total revenue decline of in fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in enterprise license transactions during the year and a reduction in license upgrade fees as discussed under product license revenues below 
demand weakness was experienced across the board during fiscal by independent software vendors with mainframe product portfolios 
we believe that this indicates that external market factors contributed significantly to this weakness 
while it is impossible to assign weights to any individual factors  market factors that may have contributed to this weakness and the resultant negative effect on license revenues experienced by us and our competitors included uncertainties associated with the roll out of ibm s z series mainframe product family and workload based pricing model and continued customer absorption of capacity purchased in association with year compliance programs 
these factors also impacted revenues for our other products because many of our mainframe customers are also customers of our other products and sometimes purchase these other products together with mainframe products in enterprise solutions 
revenues from companies we acquired in purchase accounting transactions during fiscal did not provide a significant offset to the revenue declines discussed above 
total revenues declined in fiscal continued absorption of prepaid capacity and difficult economic conditions in domestic and international markets throughout fiscal have resulted in reduced information technology spending by many of our customers 
though the number of license transactions declined only during fiscal as compared to fiscal  tighter budgets and higher required approval levels caused many customers to enter into smaller transactions in terms of dollar value 
fiscal revenues were also impacted by the deferral of million of license revenue due to certain flexible terms and conditions included in a number of customer agreements 
though fiscal revenues were down in all quarters compared to the prior year  revenues in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal showed sequential growth over the immediately preceding quarters 
product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal and product license revenues our product license revenues primarily consist of product license fees and license upgrade fees  both of which are related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees are all fees associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time 
license upgrade fees are all fees associated with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on a larger computer or computers 
license upgrade fees are primarily generated by our mainframe products and include fees associated both with current and future additional processing capacity 
in addition to product license fees and license upgrade fees  license revenues also include  to a lesser extent  term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a limited period of time 
our north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal while license revenues were down across all product groups  the largest contributor to the revenue declines in both fiscal and was decreased capacity based license upgrade fees 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal fiscal growth in application database performance management license fees was partially offset by decreases in enterprise server management license and upgrade fees 
while license revenues were down across most product groups from fiscal to fiscal  decreased capacity based license upgrade fees were the largest contributor to the revenue decline for the year 
the international license revenue increase for fiscal and decline for fiscal both included a decrease of due to foreign currency exchange rate changes during the periods  after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program 
maintenance  enhancement and support revenues maintenance  enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance  enhancement and support enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
these fees are generally charged annually and have historically equaled to of the discounted price of the product 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of x support at a standard rate of of the discounted price of the associated product 
in connection with this revision  we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products  whereas prior to this revision such periods were days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products 
because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement  in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur 
while this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time  there will be a negative short term revenue impact 
in addition  there is a risk that our revenues could be negatively impacted if customers do not accept these changes to the maintenance program and choose to license competing products instead 
because this change was made late in the year  the impact on fiscal license and maintenance revenues was not significant 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for mainframe products 
historically  we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
to date  we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance  enhancement and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
product line revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions enterprise server management business integrated scheduling application database performance management recovery storage management other software total license maintenance revenues    we market over software solutions designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in mainframe  distributed computing and internet environments 
these solutions fall into the five broad categories above 
in managing our investment in these product categories we have considered each to be included in one of three strategic groups 
the first group includes our enterprise server management and business integrated scheduling solutions 
our objective for this group has been to extend our core strengths in these markets 
the second strategic group includes our application database performance management and recovery storage management solutions 
our objective for this group has been to build our business in fast growing markets 
the last group includes our other software products  such as our security  erp  network management  output management and subscription services 
the objective for this group has been to make strategic investments in what we anticipate will be sources of future growth 
our enterprise server management and business integrated scheduling solutions combined represented  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined both from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal because this group includes a high proportion of mainframe solutions  the external market factors discussed above were the primary cause of the revenue decline in fiscal  more than offsetting the revenue growth for our business integrated scheduling solutions 
in fiscal  license revenue decreases for both product groups due to the economic factors and the decline in capacity based license upgrade fees discussed above more than offset maintenance revenue increases 
our application database performance management and recovery storage management solutions combined contributed of total software revenues for each of fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal though this group does not include a significant proportion of mainframe products  fiscal revenues for these solutions were negatively impacted by the reduction in enterprise license transactions as discussed above  because many of our mainframe customers are also customers of these products and sometimes purchase these products together with mainframe products in enterprise solutions 
in fiscal  license revenue decreases for both product groups due to the economic factors discussed above more than offset maintenance revenue increases 
our other software solutions contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and grew from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  revenue decreases from our output management and erp solutions more than offset growth from our security solutions and from our acquisitions of evity in april and optisystems in august fiscal growth includes increases in revenues from our erp and security solutions  our subscription services and the network management solutions that were associated with our acquisition of perform sa perform in february  which more than offset the license revenue decline for our output management solutions 
professional services revenues professional services revenues  representing fees from implementation  integration and education services performed during the period  represented  and of total revenues  respectively  for fiscal  and professional services revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal as we increased the related headcount to meet the increased demand for our service offerings during that period 
the decline in professional services revenues from fiscal to fiscal related to our decreased license revenues  as this results in less demand for our implementation and integration services 
expenses percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions selling and marketing research and development cost of professional services general and administrative acquired research and development amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles restructuring and severance costs n a n a legal settlement n a merger related costs and compensation charges total operating expenses    selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
personnel costs and sales commissions were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and the expense decline in fiscal selling and marketing year end headcount increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal and decreased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal sales commissions increased from fiscal to fiscal even though fiscal license revenues declined  because of sales incentives implemented in the last half of the year 
the decline in commissions and other personnel costs from fiscal to fiscal related to decreased license revenues and headcount reductions throughout the year 
selling and marketing expenses were further impacted in fiscal by the costs associated with our first global users conference and increased consulting fees for implementation of a customer relationship management system 
in fiscal  consulting fees and travel costs declined 
research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of our products  computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center  royalties and the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization 
research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize our software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 and amortize these costs over the products estimated useful lives 
during fiscal  and  we capitalized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of software development and purchased software costs 
we amortized million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of capitalized software development and purchased software costs pursuant to sfas no 
 including million  million and million  respectively  to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
we accelerated the amortization of these software products in each of these years as they were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets 
as a result of the changes in market conditions and research and development headcount reductions during fiscal  we have begun focusing more on our core and high potential growth businesses 
as part of this effort  we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal and discontinued certain products throughout the portfolio 
to the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products  we accelerated the amortization to write these balances off 
this caused the increase in accelerated amortization from fiscal to fiscal the increase in our research and development expenses for fiscal was primarily the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs  and the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization 
we increased our headcount in the research and development organization from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  including the addition of personnel from acquired companies 
research and development expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the net effect of software capitalization and amortization  including the accelerated amortization discussed above  and a million write off of prepaid royalties and other assets related to technology we no longer plan to utilize 
these additional expenses more than offset reduced headcount costs  travel costs and consulting fees during the period 
we reduced our research and development headcount by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal total capitalized software development costs  net of amortization  at march   were million 
under sfas no 
 we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified 
determining net realizable value as defined by sfas no 
requires that we estimate future cash flows to be generated by the products and to use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off  if any 
actual cash flows and amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates 
also  any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant research and development expenses related to software asset write offs 
during fiscal  we also wrote off software assets totaling million associated with certain business information integration products that were discontinued during the year as a result of the dissolution of that business unit as part of our restructuring plan 
this charge is included in restructuring and severance costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal and is discussed further below under the heading restructuring and severance costs 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation  integration and education services that we perform for our customers  and the related infrastructure to support this business 
the increase in these costs from fiscal to fiscal resulted from increased headcount to support the growth in professional services revenues during that period 
the decrease in these costs from fiscal to fiscal is consistent with the professional services revenue decline for the period and the resulting headcount reductions 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  facilities management and human resources 
other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance  costs of managing our foreign currency exposure and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings 
the expense growth in fiscal primarily related to increased personnel costs  including million of severance costs for management personnel who terminated their employment during the fourth quarter of that year 
this severance amount included cash and restricted stock expense 
the decline in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily related to decreased personnel costs  travel costs and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings 
fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew from fiscal to fiscal and declined from fiscal to fiscal acquired research and development in executing our product strategies  we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and  in the case of boole  bgs and new dimension  established software companies 
we believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market  where we must compete with a variety of software vendors  and where our products must integrate with the predominant database management systems  operating systems  network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment 
accordingly  we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture 
the acquired technology companies are often small  early stage software companies with minimal to no revenues  quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace 
this strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans 
the following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal  and acquired acquired goodwill total technology ipr d and other price in millions fiscal new dimension fiscal evity optisystems various immaterial acquisitions fiscal various immaterial acquisitions in april  we acquired through a public tender offer in excess of of the outstanding ordinary shares of new dimension 
total consideration paid approximated million  including the cost of the remaining of outstanding shares acquired during fiscal and the historical cost of approximately million for shares of new dimension previously owned by boole 
we allocated million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed 
we allocated million  or of the purchase price  to in process research and development ipr d  which represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility nor had an alternative future use 
at the acquisition date  new dimension was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities in the following areas o integrated operations architecture r for the enterprise  which was to be the supporting infrastructure for all of the distributed systems products from new dimension 
this project  as originally intended  was cancelled as we determined it was more appropriate to gradually extend the existing distributed systems infrastructure rather than replace it 
o expansion of the output management product family to include products for distributed systems 
o e business enablement  the development of the infrastructure necessary to internet ize the entire new dimension product family 
o security  including additional features and add on applications for existing security applications 
o enhancements to the control m r  control d r  control sa r and enterprise controlstation r products 
as of the date of the new dimension acquisition  we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential use of the technology in different products  the stage of development and life cycle of each project  resale of the software and internal use 
as such  the value of the purchased ipr d was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
as of march   the integrated operations architecture for the enterprise project has been cancelled and the remaining projects have been completed and the related products were made generally available 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of evity in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million  including cash consideration of million  million shares of common stock  million common stock options and transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
net tangible assets acquired were insignificant 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to evity s research and development projects not yet completed 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended june  at the acquisition date  evity was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of siteangel  an enhanced version of evity s siteangel website performance monitoring product  as well as new technologies in the areas of load testing and network infrastructure 
the projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the web performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
evity had incurred nearly million on the in process projects and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
we completed siteangel during fiscal and project costs were materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
also during fiscal  the remaining projects in process at the acquisition date were suspended indefinitely 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of optisystems in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million in cash  including transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles  million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed  and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to optisystems incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended september  at the acquisition date  optisystems was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several components of its energizer r for r product 
the projects under development at the valuation date represent next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the enterprise application performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
optisystems had incurred approximately million on the in process projects  and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
the projects have been completed and project costs were materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
we completed other immaterial acquisitions during fiscal and which were accounted for under the purchase method as indicated in the table above 
in making our purchase price allocations  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
in the present value calculations  aggregate revenues for the new dimension  evity and optisystems developed  in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately  and  respectively  for the four years  five years and five years following acquisition  respectively  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecasts and risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to were used to value the acquired ipr d for the various acquisitions during fiscal  and specifically  discount rates of  and were used to value the acquired ipr d for new dimension  evity and optisystems  respectively 
rates of  and were used in discounting the cash flows associated with the respective developed technologies 
these discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
the ipr d charge for fiscal also includes the write off of assets totaling million related to a technology agreement with envive corporation that was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill  workforce  customer base  software and other intangible assets 
we are amortizing these intangibles over three to five year periods  which reflect the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the increase in amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal is related to the evity  optisystems and other acquisitions completed during fiscal during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed because sustained negative economic conditions impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
current economic indicators suggest that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to acquired technology to reflect these assets at their current estimated net realizable values and million related to goodwill to reflect these assets at their current estimated fair values 
these charges are reflected together with amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal  as amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles 
we evaluated our acquired technology under the provisions of sfas no 
 our other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and of long lived assets to be disposed of  and our enterprise level goodwill under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
the impairment charges for acquired technology reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated net realizable values of the products 
the net realizable values for acquired technology were estimated as the future gross revenues from the products reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the products  including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support required to satisfy our responsibilities set forth at the time of sale 
the impairment charges for goodwill reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values of these assets 
fair value was determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows related to these assets 
no impairment was identified for our other intangible assets 
impairment charges by asset category were as follows total acquired impairment technology goodwill charge in millions acquisition new dimension evity optisystems perform total as of march   acquired technology of million and goodwill and intangibles of million remained 
as of april   we will adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this pronouncement  goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value 
acquired technology will continue to be amortized under sfas no 
goodwill and intangibles of million will remain at april   that will no longer be amortized 
intangible assets of million with finite lives will continue to be amortized over those useful lives 
we review the realizability of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis  and when there is an indication of impairment  we perform the procedures under the applicable accounting pronouncements to quantify any impairment that exists 
determining the amount of impairment of these assets  if any  requires that we estimate future cash flows and make judgments regarding discount rates and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of those assets  as applicable 
actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from our estimates 
future impairment charges under existing pronouncements and under sfas no 
to be adopted april   could be material 
restructuring and severance costs during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions 
this plan included the involuntary termination of  employees during the year 
these actions were across all divisions and geographies and the affected employees received cash severance packages 
during fiscal  we also discontinued certain business information integration products as a result of the dissolution of that business unit  and announced the closure of certain locations throughout the world 
a charge of million was recorded during fiscal for employee severance  the write off of software assets related to discontinued products  net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the related technology  and office closures 
during fiscal  we sold our enterprise data propagation edp technology for a minority equity investment in the purchaser and future cash payments to be made based on the purchaser s quarterly sales to our former edp customers over the next four years 
as these products were part of the discontinued business information integration products  the proceeds will be recorded as a reduction of restructuring and severance costs  as a recovery of the amount previously written off for these products 
for fiscal  proceeds of million were recorded  reflecting the estimated fair value of the equity investment received 
as the future cash payments  if any  cannot be currently estimated  they will be recorded in the periods received as a reduction of restructuring and severance costs up to the amount previously written off 
any receipts in excess of the related asset write off will be reflected as other income 
as of march   million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the restructuring plan remained accrued for payment in future periods  as follows balance at paid out or balance at march  charged to charged against march  expense related assets in millions severance and related expenses write off of software assets  net of proceeds received facilities costs total accrual legal settlement in october  we settled all claims in a lawsuit styled bmc software  inc  plaintiff  vs

see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
merger related costs and compensation charges in conjunction with our merger with boole in march  management approved a formal plan of restructuring which included steps to be taken to integrate the operations of the two companies  consolidate duplicate facilities and streamline operations to achieve reductions in overhead expenses in future periods 
during fiscal  million was incurred related to the plan  primarily for termination benefits 
during fiscal and  million and million  respectively  of previously accrued merger costs were reversed  as certain lease and severance obligations were satisfied at amounts below the amounts originally estimated 
these reversals are reflected as a reduction of merger related costs and compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal and as of march   we have minimal facilities costs that remain accrued 
during fiscal and  we recorded merger related compensation charges of million and million  respectively 
these compensation charges are primarily related to the vesting of common stock issued as part of the evity acquisition to certain evity employee shareholders who we employed after the acquisition 
the vesting of the evity related common stock will be complete during the first quarter of fiscal other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  realized gains and losses on marketable and other investment securities  and interest expense on short term borrowings 
other income  net increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal other income for fiscal includes a million one time gain related to the sale of a financial instrument and a one time million gain related to a real estate transaction 
the remaining increases in other income  net for fiscal are primarily due to decreased interest expense on short term borrowings 
in fiscal  the decrease in other income  net primarily relates to the one time gains in the prior year discussed above  a million loss on a marketable security and million of impairment charges related to other equity investments 
these decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of our payment of all short term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the decreased effective income tax rate is the result of lower taxes associated with our european operations and the effect of tax exempt interest on certain investments 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and are primarily impacted by acquisition related charges during those years that are not deductible for tax purposes 
for an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
recording income tax benefits results in the recognition of tax assets representing current tax refunds receivable from net operating loss carrybacks and or the future benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards at each balance sheet date to determine their realizability  considering currently enacted tax laws 
if we determine that the assets are not fully realizable  a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the asset balances to their realizable values through a charge to income tax expense 
determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations 
actual taxable income could differ from our estimates 
as of march   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and therefore no valuation allowance is recorded related to this asset 
if we conclude that this tax asset requires a valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material 
as of march   we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to tax credit carryforwards will not be realized and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance for this amount 
if we conclude that this tax asset requires an additional valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
the statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting at the point of acquisition for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets  other than those acquired in a business combination  and the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
under this statement  all goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those useful lives 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   except that goodwill and intangibles that arise from business combinations after june  will not be amortized 
as such  we will adopt the statement in its entirety on april  adoption of this statement will eliminate a portion of the amortization expense from our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss  which for fiscal totaled million 
goodwill and intangibles of million will remain at april   that will no longer be amortized 
we are in the process of determining the impairment charge  if any  that will be required upon adoption of this statement 
if such a charge is required  it will be reflected as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the quarter ending june  in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the obligation is incurred  the liability must be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
upon initial recognition of such a liability  an equal amount must be capitalized into the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and subsequently expensed over its useful life 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related to statement the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe that adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

 in millions  except per share data total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of professional services general and administrative expenses acquired research and development amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles restructuring and severance costs merger related costs and compensation charges operating income loss net earnings loss basic eps diluted eps shares used in computing basic eps shares used in computing diluted eps liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash and cash equivalents were million and our marketable securities were million  for a total of  million  an increase of million from the march  total 
our working capital as of march   was million  reflecting an increase from the march  balance of million due primarily to positive operating cash flow 
stockholders equity as of march   was billion 
we continue to invest a portion of our cash in securities with maturities beyond one year 
while typically yielding greater returns  this reduces reported working capital 
our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and are highly liquid 
the majority of our marketable securities are classified as held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as such  they are recorded at amortized cost and changes in their fair values during the holding period are not reflected in the financial statements 
if the creditworthiness of an issuer of these securities deteriorates  losses would be recorded when we determine the decline in fair value is other than temporary  when we sell the securities or upon default by the issuer 
the remainder of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
changes in the fair values of these securities are reflected as unrealized gains and losses in stockholders equity and as a component of comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on these securities are reflected in earnings either when realized through our sale of the securities or when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
determining whether a value decline is other than temporary requires that we make judgments about expected future events 
actual future fair values could differ from our expectations 
we continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we provide financing on a portion of these sales transactions  to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
we participate in established programs with third party financing institutions to securitize or sell a significant portion of our finance receivables 
we utilize certain wholly owned  fully consolidated special purpose entities in these transfers 
in addition  we securitize finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two special purpose entities sponsored by third party financial institutions 
the entities sponsored by third party financial institutions are multi seller conduits with access to commercial paper markets  that purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us 
we have no ownership in either of the third party financial institution sponsored entities and have no voting influence over either of these entities operating and financial decisions 
as a result  we do not consolidate these entities 
when we sell receivables in securitizations of software installment contracts  we retain a beneficial interest in the securitized receivables  which is subordinate to the interests of the entities sponsored by the third party financial institutions 
the subordinate interests are measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using our best estimates of the key assumptions  including expected credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
we periodically review the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the retained interest 
the financing institutions have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
our retained interests are subordinate to the investors interests and the value of the retained interests is subject to credit and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets 
at march  and  our retained interests were million and million  respectively 
other finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
we record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financing institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables  including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors 
we have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default 
during the year ended march   we transferred million of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis without a negative cash flow impact 
net cash used in investing activities in the year ended march  was million  primarily related to capitalized software development costs and disbursements for the purchase of marketable securities which were partially offset by receipts from the maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended march  was million  which derived primarily from the repayment of all short term borrowings and treasury stock purchases 
on april   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in common stock 
during the year ended march   we purchased million shares for million 
from the inception of the repurchase plan through march   we have purchased million shares for million 
we plan to continue to buy stock on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions  cash flows and other possible uses of our cash 
we have no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and beyond 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
our historical financial results should not be seen as indicative of future results 
the timing and size of license contracts could cause our quarterly revenues and earnings to fluctuate 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially quarter to quarter 
the timing and amount of our license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
we generally operate with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expectations until the final days or day of a quarter 
we have a high degree of operating leverage 
our business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage 
a substantial portion of our operating costs and expenses consists of employee and facility related costs  which are relatively fixed over the short term 
in addition  our expense levels and hiring plans are based substantially on our projections of future revenues 
if near term demand weakens in a given quarter  there would likely be a material adverse effect on operating results and a resultant drop in our stock price 
we may have difficulty achieving our eps goal 
there is a risk that we may not be able to achieve our earnings per share goal in the near term 
if current weak global economic conditions continue or if there is continued global economic uncertainty due to terrorism or wartime conditions  we may find it difficult to sustain our revenues or achieve revenue growth 
although we have taken steps to reduce our expenses in light of current conditions  our ability to achieve our earnings per share goal for fiscal is dependent upon increasing revenues year over year 
if we are unable to achieve our earnings per share goal  our stock price may be adversely affected 
decreasing demand for enterprise license transactions could adversely affect revenues 
fees from enterprise license transactions have historically been a fundamental component of our revenues 
these revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their computer processing capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater processing capacity in future periods 
prior to  we licensed many of our larger customers to operate our mainframe products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current mainframe processing capacity 
during the past several years  we also entered into many enterprise license agreements with our larger customers to operate our distributed systems products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current distributed processing capacity 
in a weak economy  these customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us 
if economic conditions weaken further  demand for data processing capacity could continue to slow or even decline 
in addition  the uncertain economic environment has reduced customers expectations of future capacity growth  thus lessening demand for licensing excess processing capacity in anticipation of future growth 
if our customers who have entered into multi year capacity based licenses for excess processing capacity do not increase their processing capacity beyond the levels previously licensed from us or license additional processing capacity in anticipation of future growth  then our license revenues may not grow and our earnings could be adversely affected 
increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect our earnings 
the market for systems management software has been increasingly competitive for the past number of years 
we compete with a variety of software vendors including ibm and computer associates 
we derived over half of our total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to enhance and market its utilities for ims and db as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors 
although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions  ibm has begun to invest more heavily in the ims and db utility market and appears to be committed to competing in these markets 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our ims  db and other products at a lower cost  our business may be materially adversely affected 
ca is also competing with us in these markets 
competition has led to increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
we continue to reduce the cost to our customers of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to such competitive pressures 
microsoft entered the distributed systems monitoring and management market through its relationship with netiq and is now competing with us in the market for management tools for the windows environment 
in connection with the introduction of its zseries mainframe server in the fourth quarter of  ibm has announced changes to its mainframe software pricing  including a new workload based pricing model offering 
we have also announced that we will support the new workload based pricing structure for the zseries mainframe server  but the software used to measure workloads is not yet available 
as such  the effect of this change on our future mainframe license revenues cannot be determined 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating and database environments 
ibm  hp  sun  microsoft and oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and  in many cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  database systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could in the future incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party source code 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as us were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon early access to third party operating and database systems 
operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available ga versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to assure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past several years  many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or distributed systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that could delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
maintenance revenue growth could slow 
maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
also  renewal rates for maintenance on our distributed systems products are lower than on our mainframe products 
changes in pricing practices could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
we may choose in fiscal or a future fiscal year to make changes to our product packaging  pricing or licensing programs 
if made  such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of x support at a standard rate of of the discounted price of the associated product 
in connection with this revision  we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products  whereas prior to this revision such periods were days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products 
because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement  in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur 
while this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time  there will be a negative short term revenue impact  which we have considered in determining our estimates of future revenues 
in addition  there is a risk that our revenues could be negatively impacted if customers do not accept these changes to the maintenance program and choose to license competing products instead 
our customers may not accept our product strategies 
historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
we are now integrating multiple software products and offering packaged solutions for customers systems 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
risks related to business combinations 
as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlap 
in addition  we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents  especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to international operations 
we have committed  and expect to continue to commit  substantial resources and funding to build our international service and support infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including many of those in which we operate  are higher than in the united states 
in order to increase international sales in fiscal and subsequent periods  we must continue to globalize our software product lines  expand existing and establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices  particularly our european operations 
our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally 
we maintain a software development office in india which operates as an extension of our primary development offices and we contract with third party developers in india 
to date  hostilities between india and pakistan in the disputed region of kashmir have not adversely affected our operations in india 
should we be unable to conduct operations in india in the future  we believe that our business would not be materially adversely affected 
conditions in israel 
our scheduling  security  output management and erp development operations are conducted primarily in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and the palestinian people and the arab countries 
in addition  israel and companies doing business with israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the arab countries since israel s establishment 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
we maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans  and to date  the current conflict in the region and hostilities within israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in israel 
in addition  certain of our israeli employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
although our businesses located in israel have historically operated effectively under these requirements  we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on our operations in the future 
possible adverse impact of interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements 
on april  and we adopted aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to reduce currency exposure associated with our rights and obligations denominated in foreign currencies that subject us to transaction risk 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month 
forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound  in europe  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region and the israeli shekel 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal  or based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   and our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on our future results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the instruments 
we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated billion at march   and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary 
based on our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the investments 
we used a var model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
