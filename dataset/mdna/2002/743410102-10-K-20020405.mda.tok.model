item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with prologis consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
some statements contained in this discussion are not historical facts but are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of because these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which prologis operates  management s beliefs  and assumptions made by management  they involve uncertainties that could significantly impact prologis financial results 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include discussions of strategy  plans or intentions of management 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
specifically  but not limited to  comments concerning prologis expectations with respect to the north american economy  its ability to raise private capital and generate income in the cdfs business segment and its plans for its investments in the temperature controlled distribution operations segment are forward looking statements 
factors which may affect outcomes and results include i changes in general economic conditions in prologis markets that could adversely affect demand for prologis facilities and the creditworthiness of prologis customers  ii changes in financial markets  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect prologis cost of capital and its ability to meet its financial needs and obligations  iii increased or unanticipated competition for distribution facilities in prologis target market cities  iv the availability of private capital to prologis and v those factors discussed under risk factors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results of operations  and requires judgment on the part of management 
generally  the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of the accounting policies discussed in note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item  those presented below have been identified by prologis as critical accounting policies 
consolidation prologis consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis trust and its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and partnerships 
all subsidiaries in which prologis owns a majority voting interest are consolidated 
investments in entities that are not consolidated but in which prologis has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  are accounted for under the equity method 
management s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of each entity includes the consideration of factors including the form of prologis ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  size of investment including loans and participation in policy making decisions 
investments in entities that prologis does not control or for which prologis does not exercise significant influence are carried at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions  including transactions with unconsolidated entities  are eliminated in prologis consolidated financial statements 
management s ability to make these judgements affects the presentation of these investments in its financial statements and  consequently  its financial position and results of operations which are used by its shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate the company 
recoverability of investments in long lived assets prologis management periodically reviews long lived assets primarily real estate and investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of the fair value of the investment involves significant judgment 
this judgment is based on management s analysis of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset 
management s ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event that a decline in fair value of a long lived asset occurs  prologis management may be required to make a determination as to whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results  the resulting cash flows and the intent to hold the long lived asset 
if an investment is considered impaired and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  a write down is recognized 
revenue recognition prologis recognizes gains or losses from the disposition of real estate assets generally at the time the title to the asset is transferred and prologis has no future involvement with the asset sold 
in certain transactions  an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire the real estate assets from prologis 
management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its level of future involvement in the entities that are acquiring the assets 
management s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each disposition transaction under the accounting guidelines for revenue recognition may impact its financial position and results of operations which are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate the company 
depreciation and useful lives of real estate assets prologis management estimates the useful lives of its depreciable long lived assets primarily real estate assets in order to record depreciation expense related to these assets 
management s ability to accurately estimate the useful lives of its long lived assets is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets 
any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized by prologis 
results of operations prologis net earnings attributable to common shares were million in  million in and million in in  basic and diluted per share net earnings attributable to common shares were and per share  respectively 
basic and diluted net earnings attributable to common shares were per share in and per share in as prologis shifted the primary focus of its development activities to the development of assets to be sold or contributed to real estate funds  the cdfs business segment had an integral role in prologis business strategy in and the cdfs business segment provided capital for prologis to fund its development activities and generated profits that contributed to prologis total income

prologis stabilized operating facilities facilities owned by prologis and the funds  were occupied and leased as of december  prologis stabilized occupancy levels have decreased as compared to occupied and leased and occupied and leased 
the term stabilized means that for acquisitions any necessary capital improvements  repositioning  new management and new marketing programs and  in the case of newly developed facilities  construction and marketing  have been in effect for a sufficient period of time generally months to achieve stabilized occupancy typically  but ranging from to  depending on the submarket and product type 
prologis  utilizing its prologis operating system r  has been successful in increasing occupancies on acquired and developed facilities during their initial months of operation 
prologis believes that the decrease in its stabilized occupancy levels in is the result of the current economic conditions in north america that have led to a slowing in customer leasing decisions and in a slowing in the absorption of new distribution facilities in the market 
prologis does not expect market conditions affected by the north american economy to improve for the next several quarters and believes that occupancies could continue to decline over the next few quarters 
however  prologis believes that it s global operating platform and the prologis operating system r will partially mitigate the effects of these occupancy decreases  as they have allowed prologis to build strong local market presence and strong customer relationships across many global markets 
in europe  leasing activity has remained constant throughout  with million square feet of leases signed during the year 
prologis believes the leasing activity in europe is currently affected more by a shift in distribution patterns of its customers and their need to reduce distribution costs than it is by the effects of general economic conditions 
the average increase in rental rates for both new and renewed leases on previously leased space million square feet for all facilities including those owned by the funds during was as compared to in and in during  the net operating income rental income less net rental expenses generated by prologis same store portfolio of operating facilities facilities owned by prologis and its consolidated and the unconsolidated real estate funds that were in operation throughout both and increased by over the same period in as compared to an increase of during as compared to 
the decrease in the growth rate in same store net operating income is due to increased bad debt expense in and to lower occupancy levels in the same store portfolio in as compared to although the average increase in rental rates for new and renewed leases was for prologis same store operating portfolio in  only million square feet of new or renewed leases were signed during therefore  rental rate growth only affected a small subset of the same store portfolio 
cdfs business net operating income from prologis cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the profits from the disposition of land parcels and distribution facilities that were developed by prologis and sold to third parties or contributed to real estate funds in which prologis maintains an ownership interest  ii development management fees earned by prologis  and iii income recognized under the equity method from prologis investment in kingspark sa prologis recognizes of the earnings of kingspark sa under the equity method including in addition to net operating income interest income and interest expense net of capitalized amounts  general and administrative expense net of capitalized amounts  income taxes and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on prologis ability to develop and lease distribution facilities that can be disposed of to generate profits and its ability to raise private capital through the formation of real estate funds or other sources 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to maintain the level of profits in this business segment 
the cdfs business segment operations and prologis income from this segment have increased each year 
the cdfs business segment s net operating income is comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  net gains on disposition of land parcels and facilities developed    development management fees    income from kingspark sa    miscellaneous fees and other income   other expenses    represents gains from the disposition of land parcels and facilities developed as follows acres  million square feet  million of proceeds  acres  million square feet  million of proceeds  and acres  million square feet  million of proceeds

prologis believes that the continuing demand for state of the art distribution facilities in europe will continue to provide it with opportunities to expand its cdfs business 
further to this objective  with  acres of land owned or controlled in europe including  acres of land owned and controlled in the united kingdom by kingspark sa  prologis believes it will not be affected by land entitlement constraints that currently exist in europe 
prologis will continue to monitor leasing activity and general economic conditions in north america as it pertains to its cdfs business segment operations

the increase in from  was primarily the result of development completions 
prologis share of prologis logistics csi s net earnings from to decreased by million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to i a million charge related to the write down of operating assets and other impairment charges  ii higher interest expense as a result of increasing external debt of this entity in with the proceeds used to repay debt to prologis  and iii a decrease in operating income as a result of lower occupancy levels in certain markets in the increase in prologis share of prologis logistics csi s net earnings of million in  from  was primarily attributable to the increase in cubic feet capacity in operation in frigoscandia s operating capacity was million  million and million cubic feet as of december   and  respectively

excluding these foreign exchange losses  prologis recognized million more loss under the equity method in  than it recognized in from its investment in frigoscandia sa the increase in prologis share of frigoscandia sa frigoscandia s net loss in from is primarily attributable to i a million charge related to the write down of operating assets and other impairment charges  ii a net loss recognized on the disposal of substantially all of frigoscandia s operating assets in germany and all of frigoscandia s operating assets in the czech republic of approximately million  offset by iii higher operating revenues and lower general and administrative expense in excluding foreign currency exchange losses  prologis recognized million more loss under the equity method in than it recognized in the increase in frigoscandia sa frigoscandia s net loss in from the loss recognized in is primarily due to i lower occupancy levels  ii a weak european vegetable harvest  and iii increases in fuel prices and expenses incurred related to trucker strikes in august and september 
other income and expense items general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expense in each year is primarily attributable to new business initiatives in north america  europe and japan 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the fluctuations in this expense between years is primarily attributable to the number of distribution facilities directly owned by prologis in each year 
see property operations 
interest expense interest expense is a function of the level of borrowings outstanding and interest rates charged on borrowings  offset by interest capitalization with respect to development activities 
interest expense  before capitalization  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in over is primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings outstanding on prologis lines of credit 
the increase in over is primarily the result of the increased use of debt to finance investment activities in each year  particularly in when prologis increased its secured debt balances to million as of december  interest expense recognized on borrowings is offset by interest capitalized with respect to prologis development activities 
capitalized interest increased by million to million in from million in and increased by million to million in from million in capitalized interest levels are reflective of prologis cost of funds and the level of development activity in each year 
other expenses other expenses were million in  million in and million in included as other expenses are land holding costs  the write off of previously capitalized pursuit costs and million of expense incurred in connection with an interest rate hedge that was terminated in land holding costs were million in  million in and million in pursuit cost write offs were million in  million in and million in gain on disposition of real estate gain on disposition of real estate represents the net gains from the disposition of distribution facilities that were acquired or developed for long term use in the property operations segment 
generally  prologis disposes of facilities in the property operations segment because such facilities are considered to be non strategic facilities 
non strategic facilities are assets located in markets or submarkets that are no longer considered target markets as well as assets that were acquired as part of previous portfolio acquisitions that are not consistent with prologis core portfolio based on the asset s size or configuration 
also  prologis will contribute facilities from its operating portfolio to complement the portfolio of developed distribution facilities that are acquired by the real estate funds 
property operations segment dispositions were as follows million square feet  million of proceeds  net gain of million  and a net gain of million recognized upon the contribution of prologis ownership of prologis european properties sarl to prologis european properties fund in january  million square feet  million of proceeds  net gains of million  and excluding prologis california million square feet  million of proceeds  net gains of million 
in august  in connection with the formation of prologis california  prologis disposed of distribution facilities and two facilities under development to prologis california 
the net sales proceeds from this disposition were million and prologis recognized a gain of million on the transaction  which is net of million that was deferred because it did not qualify for income recognition due to prologis continuing ownership in prologis california 
prologis received an equity interest in prologis california of million and prologis california assumed million of prologis debt 
the remaining proceeds were received in cash 
income loss from unconsolidated entities the combined income loss from unconsolidated entities that is not directly attributable to any of prologis three business segments was a loss of million for see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item 
this amount consists primarily of losses recognized by prologis under the equity method from its investments in two unconsolidated entities whose sole purpose is to hold preferred stock in technology companies 
in  these entities both recognized write downs of their investments to estimated fair value 
prologis share of these write downs was million which was offset by fee income recognized by these entities in under license fee agreements 
for  the total income of million from these entities is primarily prologis share of the license fee income recognized by these two unconsolidated entities 
see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item foreign currency exchange losses  net prologis recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement and settlement of intercompany and third party debt of prologis foreign subsidiaries 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange gains and losses recognized in each period are a product of movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  the pound sterling and the yen and the level of intercompany and third party debt outstanding that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
during  and  the euro and pound sterling depreciated against the us dollar which is the primary cause of the remeasurement losses recognized in these years 
prologis began utilizing foreign currency put options to hedge its foreign currency exchange risk in september see liquidity and capital resources derivative financial instruments 
income taxes prologis is taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes and is not required to pay federal income taxes if minimum distribution and income  asset and shareholder tests are met 
not all of prologis consolidated subsidiaries in the united states are qualified reit subsidiaries for tax purposes 
also  the foreign countries in which prologis operates do not recognize reits under their respective tax laws 
accordingly  prologis recognizes income taxes as appropriate and in accordance with gaap in the united states with respect to the taxable earnings of certain of its taxable subsidiaries 
current income tax expense recognized in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
current income tax expense is higher in primarily due to the level of income recognized by prologis taxable subsidiary operating in the cdfs business segment  prologis development services 
prologis recognized deferred income tax expense of million in and million in and prologis did not record deferred income taxes in prologis deferred income tax component of total income taxes is a function of each year s temporary differences items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for book purposes as well as the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance to adjust certain deferred tax assets primarily deferred tax assets created by tax net operating losses to their estimated realizable value 
in  the effect of the current year s temporary differences were entirely offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance resulting in no net deferred tax expense being recognized 
cumulative effect of accounting change through  prologis capitalized costs associated with start up activities and organization costs and amortized such costs over an appropriate period  generally five years 
statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that costs associated with organizational  pre opening  and start up activities be expensed as incurred  was adopted by prologis on january  accordingly  prologis expensed million of unamortized organization and start up costs as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of all such costs incurred since have been expensed

prologis has guaranteed a million pound sterling the currency equivalent of approximately million as of december  based on currency exchange rates quoted by reuters line of credit of a subsidiary of kingspark sa as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
prologis has entered into a subscription agreement to make additional capital contributions of million euros the currency equivalent of approximately million as of december  through september distribution and dividend requirements prologis current distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders based upon what it considers to be a reasonable percentage of cash flow and at the level that will allow prologis to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  annual distributions are expected to be consistently higher than annual earnings 
cash distributions paid in  and were per common share  per common share and per common share  respectively 
the board set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of of per common share on february  to holders of common shares as of february  the payment of distributions is subject to the discretion of the board and is dependent upon the financial condition and operating results of prologis and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
as of december   prologis had three series of cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on prologis preferred shares are per share series c  per share series d and per series e preferred share 
pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares  prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to the common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
other commitments as of december   prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts  subject to prologis final due diligence  for the acquisition of million square feet of distribution facilities at an estimated acquisition cost of million 
the foregoing transactions are subject to a number of conditions  and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated 
as of december   prologis had million of funds escrowed as the result of tax deferred exchange transactions that can be used to acquire these assets 
in january  prologis completed the acquisition of one of these facilities aggregating million square feet at a total acquisition cost of million 
in addition  as of december   prologis had facilities under development with an expected cost at completion of million of which million was unfunded 
in january  prologis announced a common share repurchase program under which it may repurchase up to million of its common shares 
the common shares have been and  to the extent these repurchases continue  will be purchased from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market prices and other conditions 
during   common shares were purchased under this program at a total cost of million 
prologis intends to fund the common share repurchase program through borrowings on its unsecured revolving credit facilities 
derivative financial instruments prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage well defined risk associated with interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions 
prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk 
market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency rates 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis income and cash flows 
credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract 
prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties  primarily global commercial banks 
prologis does not anticipate non performance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts 
should a counterparty fail to perform  however  prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent of the positive fair market value of the derivative instruments  if any 
as of december   prologis had foreign currency put option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million euros and million pounds sterling the currency equivalent of approximately million based on currency exchange rates quoted by reuters related to its operations in europe 
the put option contracts were fully paid for at execution and provide prologis with the option to exchange euros and pound sterling for us dollars at a fixed exchange rate such that  if the euro or pound sterling were to depreciate against the us dollar to predetermined levels as set by the contract  prologis could exercise its options and mitigate its foreign currency exchange losses 
the outstanding contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were marked to market through income as of december  in  prologis recognized aggregate expense of million on various put option contracts  including realized losses of million and mark to market income of million 
conversion to the euro effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european monetary union launched the new monetary unit  the euro  as the single currency for the member countries of the european monetary union 
during the period from january  to january   a transition period was in effect during which time the euro was available for non cash transactions 
however  transactions could continue to be denominated in the old national currencies 
after january   all transactions must be denominated in the euro 
the targeted exchange rates of the old national currencies to the euro were determined in may conversion to the euro has not had  nor is management aware of any future effects of the conversion to the euro that will have  a material impact on its business operations or results of operations 
new tax legislation due to the previous limitations in the code  certain of prologis taxable subsidiaries those entities whose operations generated income that was restricted under the reit rules were formed as entities in which prologis owned of the non voting preferred stock and a third party owned of the voting common stock 
accordingly  prologis accounted for these types of investments under the equity method rather than consolidating the investments in its balance sheet and results of operations as the non voting ownership interest did not result in prologis having control of the entities 
the reit modernization act rma  which was effective on january   modified certain provisions of the code with respect to the taxation of reits 
primarily  the rma allows for the creation of taxable reit subsidiaries trs that allows prologis and other reits to own up to of a trs previously limited to of the voting stock 
however  certain state law restrictions have prevented prologis from changing the ownership structures such that prologis owns of these entities 
see item properties unconsolidated entities and note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in is primarily attributable to the recognition of prologis share of aggregate charges of million related to the write down of technology related investments of certain of prologis unconsolidated entities 
funds from operation attributable to common shares increased million from to funds from operations does not represent net income or cash from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  which is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as an indicator of prologis operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
prologis considers funds from operations to be a useful supplemental measure of comparative period operating performance and as a supplemental measure to provide management  financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders with an indication of prologis ability to fund its capital expenditures and investment activities and to fund other cash needs 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit generally as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from sales of properties except those gains and losses from sales of properties upon completion or stabilization under pre sale agreements  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities to reflect their funds from operations on the same basis 
prologis includes gains and losses from the disposition of its cdfs business segment assets in funds from operations 
funds from operations  as presented by prologis  is modified from the nareit definition 
prologis funds from operations measure does not include i charges related to the write down of non cdfs business segments assets  ii deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses of prologis taxable subsidiaries  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between prologis and its consolidated and unconsolidated entities  iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of third party debt of prologis foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities  and v mark to market adjustments related to derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis foreign currency risks 
these adjustments to the nareit definition are made to reflect prologis funds from operations on a comparable basis with the other reits that do not engage in the types of transactions that give rise to these items 
funds from operations is as follows in thousands year ended december  net earnings attributable to common shares    add deduct real estate related depreciation and amortization    gain on disposition of non cdfs business segment assets    foreign currency exchange losses  net    deferred income tax expense benefit   cumulative effect of accounting change  prologis share of reconciling items of unconsolidated entities real estate related depreciation and amortization    write down of operating assets and other impairment charges  gain loss on disposition of non cdfs business segment assets  foreign currency exchange gains losses  net    deferred income tax expense benefit   cumulative effect of accounting change  funds from operations attributable to common shares    see results of operations other income and expense items foreign currency exchange losses  net

risk factors prologis operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  ability to pay distributions on common shares and the market price of common shares 
these risks include  among others general real estate risks general economic conditions prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local  regional  national and international conditions that affect the markets in which it owns industrial distribution facilities 
prologis operating performance depends on the economic conditions of markets in which its distribution facilities are concentrated 
while prologis does not have in excess of of its total portfolio in any one market  it does have significant holdings in atlanta  chicago  dallas ft 
worth  los angeles  paris  san francisco and the united kingdom 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in these larger markets  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for industrial distribution facilities  become less favorable relative to other geographic areas 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis operating income and the value of its common shares 
risks particular to real estate real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through our market research and property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
the factors that can affect real estate values include changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for industrial real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  the attractiveness of our facilities to potential customers  competition from other available facilities  the ability of prologis to provide adequate maintenance and insurance on its facilities  the ability of prologis to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  interest rate levels at which prologis may borrow funds and the availability of funds to prologis  potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  and other laws 
risks associated with concentration of prologis investments in the industrial sector prologis property operations and cdfs business segments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis business activities included other types of real estate investments 
risks associated with prologis development activities prologis has developed a significant number of distribution facilities since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals 
prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities 
these risks include the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned with the related investment written off  the risk that construction costs of a facility may exceed original estimates or may not be concluded on schedule including the possibility of contract default  the effect of local weather conditions and local or national strikes  or shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment which could make the project less profitable than originally estimated  and the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not make the project as profitable as originally estimated 
risks associated with the disposition of prologis facilities prologis has disposed of or contributed to real estate funds a significant number of distribution facilities in recent years and prologis intends to continue to pursue disposition activities as opportunities arise  particularly in its cdfs business segment 
prologis ability to dispose of facilities on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors  some of which are beyond the control of prologis management  primarily competition from other owners of facilities that are also trying to dispose of their facilities 
prologis ability to complete and lease developed facilities will impact its ability to dispose of or contribute these facilities 
should prologis not have sufficient facilities available that meet the investment criteria of future real estate funds or of prologis european properties fund  then the dispositions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels could have an adverse effect on the market price of common shares 
further  the inability of prologis to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse affect on prologis 
risks associated with acquisition of facilities prologis acquires distribution facilities from time to time 
the acquisition of facilities involves risks including the risk that the acquired facility will not perform as anticipated and the risks that the expected costs for renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process prove to be inaccurate 
there is  and it is expected that there will continue to be  significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities  if necessary 
tenant default prologis income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their obligations to prologis 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlords 
ability to renew leases or re let space as leases expire prologis income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its distribution facilities 
prologis has million square feet a total of million square feet leased of distribution space with leases that expire in and the funds have a combined million square feet a total of million square feet leased of distribution space with leases that expire in the number of distribution facilities in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis ability to lease distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 
real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets and that may tend to limit the ability of prologis to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of facilities disposed of in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the facilities  or meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability at any time to sell assets  or contribute assets to real estate funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 
prologis insurance coverage does not include all potential losses prologis and its unconsolidated entities currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each entity s facilities and business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar facilities 
prologis believes its facilities and the facilities of its unconsolidated entities are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods and losses from earthquakes  acts of war or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur with respect to one or more of prologis facilities  prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the facility 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities 
prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate investments that are likely to be material to prologis financial condition 
however  prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on prologis real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis cash flow and  consequently  its ability to pay distributions to its shareholders 
financing and capital risks access to capital prologis  as a reit  is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
consequently  prologis is  as are all reits  dependent on external capital to funds its development and acquisition activities 
due to the reduced availability of direct public debt and public equity capital at favorable prices in the real estate industry during the last several years  prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of real estate funds that acquire facilities from prologis 
prologis ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies 
further  prologis generates significant profits as a result of these dispositions 
to the extent that private capital is not available to acquire facilities from prologis  these profits may not be realized which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of its competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels could have an adverse effect on the market price of common shares 
prologis is obligated to contribute all of the facilities it develops within certain specified markets in europe to prologis european properties fund  subject to these facilities meeting specified investment criteria 
prologis european properties fund s investors have entered into subscription agreements whereby they have committed to provide capital to prologis european properties fund through september should any of the investors in prologis european properties fund default on this commitment or should prologis not secure funding commitments after september  the ability of prologis to dispose of its development pipeline in europe will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate cash flow would be adversely affected 
limitations on debt prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only  if upon such incurrence  prologis debt to book capitalization ratio  as adjusted  would not exceed 
the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if  for example  it were necessary in order for prologis to continue to qualify as a reit under the code 
if this policy were changed  prologis could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders 
debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the risk that prologis will not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancings will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
currently  prologis utilizes its short term borrowing capability over billion available under four credit agreements in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development  acquisition and distribution requirements 
prologis four short term credit agreements have maturities during million  million  million and million 
the ability of prologis to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including  general economic conditions and interest rate levels 
prologis short term credit agreements bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase prologis interest expense under these agreements 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
requirements of credit facilities the terms of prologis indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and developments at prologis  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the funds available for distribution to prologis shareholders or for reinvestment 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gain in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to prologis shareholders at least of its ordinary taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell facilities on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be a reit 
prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers prologis disposes of and contributes facilities from both its property operations segment and from within its cdfs business to third parties and to real estate funds 
some of these dispositions and contributions are made from prologis taxable subsidiaries 
under the code  if the disposition or contribution of facilities is deemed to be a prohibited transaction  a penalty tax on the resulting income could be assessed 
the question of what constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the internal revenue service could contend that certain dispositions or contributions by prologis are prohibited transactions 
while prologis management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute  if the matter was successfully argued by the internal revenue service the penalty tax could be assessed against the profits from these transactions 
additionally  any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
other risks influence of prologis principal shareholder may impact prologis management and operations prologis and security capital are parties to a third amended and restated investor agreement  dated as of september  pursuant to the investor agreement  security capital has the right  so long as it owns between and of the common shares  to nominate one person to the board 
so long as security capital owns or more of the common shares  security capital will be entitled to nominate a proportionate number of persons to the board subject to a maximum of three nominees if the size of the board does not increase above the current size of ten trustees 
under the investor agreement  so long as it owns at least of the common shares  security capital also has the right of prior approval with respect to the following matters the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  other than issuances in connection with option  dividend reinvestment and similar plans  for less than the fair market value of such securities  the issuance of any preferred shares which would result in the fixed charge coverage ratio being less than to  adopting any employee benefit plans under which common shares may be issued  the compensation of senior officers of prologis  and the incurrence of additional indebtedness which would result in the interest expense coverage ratio being less than to prologis is dependent on key personnel prologis executive and senior officers have a significant role in prologis success 
the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market 
the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely effect prologis financial condition and cash flow 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets and have an adverse affect on the market price of common shares 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate  which could adversely affect the market price of such common shares 
a decrease in the market price of the common shares could reduce prologis ability to raise additional equity capital in the public markets 
foreign currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currencies of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis performance 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects through the use of debt denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency put option contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 
government regulations and actions there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis and its facilities 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur 
further  economic and political factors  including civil unrest  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states  but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested  can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
on a limited basis  prologis uses certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce its market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with board approved policies 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as the potential loss in future earnings and cash flow with respect to interest rate exposure and future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure 
prologis sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objective  prologis primarily borrows on a fixed rate basis 
therefore  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate lines of credit 
although prologis has no interest rate derivatives outstanding as of december   prologis has in the past and may in the future  utilize derivative instruments as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage its interest rate exposure 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for interest rate related financial instruments was approximately million on both future earnings and cash flow for the year ended december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve 
foreign currency risk prologis uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense from foreign entities 
in addition  prologis incurs foreign currency risk related to third party and intercompany loans of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity 
the remeasurement of these loans results in foreign currency exchange gains or losses that are recognized by prologis 
however  prologis does not incur an actual cash gain or loss until the loans are repaid 
prologis exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  british pound sterling  swedish krona and japanese yen 
based on the results of a sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated year end market risk exposure to future earnings related to these loans was million 
prologis translates the income and expenses of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and its share of the income recognized under the equity method from its unconsolidated entities 
prologis hedges the foreign currency risk associated with approximately of the net income from its consolidated and unconsolidated entities through foreign currency put option contracts 
prologis sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  estimated the year end market risk exposure to future earnings of prologis was million 
the effect of the assumed adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of prologis consolidated and unconsolidated entities has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it 
however  since prologis hedges approximately of its projected net income from foreign entities  approximately of the impact to total net income from its foreign entities of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments
