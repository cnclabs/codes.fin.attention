lubricant sales for the year were million  up over the prior year 
hand cleaner sales were million  up by 
household product sales were million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the prior year included only four months of household product sales subsequent to the acquisition of global household brands in april  and the current year had increased household product sales as a result of the acquisition of the spot shot brand in may the reported results reflect the adoption of eitf issue accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
the application of this guidance has no effect on net income  but reclassifies certain marketing and promotional expenses from operating expenses to a reduction in sales 
the related marketing and promotional expenses that are now being recorded as reductions in sales include  coupons  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores  co operative advertising and other promotional activity 
this reclassification reduced both net sales and advertising and sales promotion expense during the year ended august  by million and by million during the prior year 
the increase in promotional costs requiring reclassification in the current year is primarily due to the marketing efforts associated with the household product line  combined with the overall increase in household product sales in fiscal compared to the prior year 
a larger portion of the marketing investment to support the household products business requires reclassification 
the effect on sales for the year is as follows in thousands months ended august  months ended august  americas europe asia pacific total americas europe asia pacific total net sales  before reclassification     reclassification of advertising and promotional expenses  net sales  as reported      of net sales  as reported net sales were million for the year ended august   an increase of from net sales of million in the prior year 
the increase is due to sales of household products along with increases in hand cleaner sales over the prior year 
excluding household product sales  sales for the year were up compared to the prior year 
in the americas region  sales for fiscal were up over the prior year 
this increase is also due to the household product sales  which are currently only sold in the americas 
sales of the household products increased significantly over the prior year  million in fiscal versus million in the prior year 
most of the increase is due to the fact that the prior year included only four months of sales after the acquisition of global household brands on april  in addition  fiscal added million in sales of spot shot during the last three months of the year  after the acquisition of heartland on may  the region s lubricant sales decreased by million or  but were partially offset by an increase in hand cleaner sales of million or 
the decrease in lubricant sales in the americas is principally a result of the decrease in wd sales  which is primarily due to the company s decision to discontinue the wd bonus ounce promotion that offered of free product in each can 
for the past years  that promotion had been a significant revenue source in the us market  however  on the downside it put a large amount of free product into the market 
the promotion was discontinued this year in conjunction with the company s long term plan to shorten the consumer repurchase cycle of wd lubricant sales in the latin america region decreased and million overall as a result of the economic challenges in the region  primarily caused by a million decrease in sales in argentina 
strong sales in mexico  central america and throughout the caribbean partially offset the poor performance in argentina 
lubricant sales in canada were down due to promotional costs and foreign exchange differences 
sales of heavy duty hand cleaners for the americas increased to million  up from million in the prior year 
the increase in the americas hand cleaner sales is attributable to the us market 
during the year  an increase in lava in store promotional activity  television advertising  and coupon offerings resulted in significantly higher sales levels 
currently  lava is sold primarily in the us for this region  of sales in the third quarter this year came from the us  and from canada and latin america 
this distribution reflects a change from fiscal in which of sales came from the us  and came from canada and latin america  principally the effect of the additional sales of household products in fiscal in europe  current year sales were up million  or over sales in fiscal lubricant sales increased by million  or  offset by million decrease in hand cleaner sales 
increased lubricant sales are due to strong sales in germany  spain  italy  the middle east and in countries in which the company sells through local distributors  where sales increased    and respectively 
the growth in germany  spain and italy is a result of expanded distribution in all trade channels 
the principal continental european countries where the company sells through a direct sales force  spain  italy  france and germany  together accounted for of the region s sales for the current year  up from last year 
in the long term  these countries are expected to be significant contributors to the region s growth 
in the asia pacific region  total sales were down over last year 
asia had a decrease in sales  down to million from million in the prior year period  resulting from the effect of counterfeit products 
australia sales for the year were up over fiscal  with increases in sales of all brands  wd  in one  and solvol

changes in product mix resulted in a increase in gross margin 
the write down of lava towel inventory in the uk resulted in a decrease in gross margin 
as noted above  promotional costs in the current year had a greater impact than in the prior year due to marketing costs associated with the household products 
the timing of certain promotional activities may continue to cause significant fluctuations in gross margin from period to period  similar to those fluctuations noted here 
while the company expects that its fiscal gross profit percentage will fluctuate in response to the timing of promotional activity  it anticipates only minimal changes in margin percentage due to the mix and costs of products sold

issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which governs the amortization of acquisition related goodwill and intangibles 
as a result  beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  the company is no longer amortizing goodwill and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives

the related marketing and promotional expenses that are now being recorded as reductions in sales include  coupons  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores  co operative advertising and other promotional activity

critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition wd company records revenue upon delivery of its products to customers 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs 
differences in judgments or estimates  such as the lengthening or shortening of our estimated delivery time used  could result in material differences in the amounts or timing of revenue recognition 
accounting for sales incentives we record sales incentives as a reduction of sales in our income statement 
sales incentives include coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores and other promotional activity 
we record these promotional activities in the period during which the related product ships  or when the expense is incurred 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates fluctuate from the standard rate 
accounting for income taxes we assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by considering future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of long lived  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangibles determined to have indefinite lives  impairment is reviewed at least annually under the guidance of sfas no 
 during our second fiscal quarter of each year 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period decreased market capitalization relative to net book value when there is indication that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
inventory valuation the company monitors the value of inventory on a continual basis  and records any provisions necessary when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of inventories are greater than net realizable value 
management s judgments and estimates of future demand and market conditions are used to determine net realizable value

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of its business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company s uk subsidiary utilizes forward contracts to limit its exposure on converting cash balances maintained in euros into british sterling 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of the foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges 
interest rate risk at august   the entire balance of the company s outstanding borrowings of million were variable interest rate loans and subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
on october   the company replaced million of the variable rate loans with a new year fixed rate loan  and obtained a new million fixed rate term loan in may the change has significantly reduced the company s exposure to interest rate risk  since only the million revolving line of credit is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
as of august   there was million outstanding under the revolving line of credit with variable interest rate of 
the company s interest rate risk on the outstanding line of credit balance is based upon the fluctuation in the libor rate 
any significant increase in the libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
other risk factors component supply risk the company depends upon its suppliers for the supply of the primary components for its wd brand and other products 
such components are subject to significant price volatility beyond the control or influence of the company 
petroleum products  of which wd and in one are comprised  have had significant price volatility in the past  and may in the future 
rising oil prices can also impact the company s cost of transporting its products 
the company has historically been successful in managing its component costs and product pricing to maintain historical gross margins 
additionally  the company has generally found alternate sources of constituent chemicals for its products readily available 
as component and raw material costs are the main contribution to cost of goods sold for all of the company s products  any significant fluctuation in the costs of components could also have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the company s products 
specifically  future can prices are exposed to fluctuation resulting from tariffs on steel  therefore any significant increase or decrease in the steel tariffs could have a significant impact on the costs of purchasing cans and the company s cost of goods 
in the event there is more significant price volatility or higher component costs generally  the company may not be able to maintain  or may choose not to maintain  its gross margins by raising its product prices without affecting demand and unit sales 
increases in the prices for the components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
reliance on supply chain the company s contract manufacturers rely upon two key vendors for the supply of empty cans used in the production of wd  carpet fresh  in one  and spot shot products 
additionally  the company relies on single manufacturers for the production of flushes and x automatic toilet bowl cleaners  x liquid cleaners  carpet fresh powder and its lava bar soap 
the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could temporarily disrupt or interrupt the production of the company s products 
the company does not have direct control over the management or business of the primary contract manufacturers utilized in the manufacturing of the company s products  except indirectly through terms as negotiated in contracts with those manufacturers 
should the terms of doing business with the company s primary contract manufacturers change  the company s cost structure may be impacted  which could have a direct impact on the company s profit margins 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive and is expected to be increasingly competitive in the future 
the company s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels  competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space 
competition in international markets varies by country 
the company is aware of many competing products  some of which sell for lower prices  however  the company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers  the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers  and its unique platform of multiple distribution channels as its primary competitive strategies 
these considerations as well as increased competition generally could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and a loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
political and economic risks the company s domestic and international operations are exposed to the risk of political and economic uncertainties 
changes in political and economic conditions may affect product cost  availability  distribution  pricing  purchasing  and consumption patterns 
while the company seeks to manage its business in consideration of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
as the company s sales extend to various countries around the globe  financial results in affected areas are exposed to a higher degree of risk 
examples of regions currently exposed to such types of risk include argentina  the middle east  and parts of asia 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully mitigate against current and future risk associated with political and economic uncertainties  or that the risks faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
as sales grow within various regions around the world  the company s exposure to this risk will increase 
business risks with the trend toward consolidation in the retail marketplace  the company s customer base is shifting toward fewer  but larger  customers who purchase in larger volumes 
the spot shot brand is presently sold to two major customers  who each account for or more of its sales 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from  any of the company s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
large customers also seek price reductions  added support  or promotional concessions 
to support this trend  the company has had to expand its use of customer and market specific promotions and allowances  which has negatively impacted and will continue to impact  the company s ability to maintain existing profit margins 
in addition  the company is subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns 
these types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels  or display and promote products within their stores 
other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results 
operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals  then the company s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations 
the company s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors  including the following the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the effectiveness of the company s advertising  marketing and promotional programs  changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes of accounting policies  the ability of the company to achieve business plans  including volume growth and pricing plans  despite high levels of competitive activity  the ability to maintain key customer relationships  the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due  the ability to successfully manage regulatory  tax and legal matters  including resolution of pending matters within current estimates  the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel  expenses for impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections  regulatory risks the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations  including among other things  the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the handling  use  treatment  storage and clean up of solid and hazardous wastes  and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the company s operations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up current sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
the company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters have not had  and are not currently expected to have  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the environmental laws under which the company operates are complicated and often increasingly more stringent  and may be applied retroactively 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of the company s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state  federal and international laws and regulations 
the company complies with these laws and regulations and seeks to anticipate developments that could impact the company s ability to continue to produce and market its products 
the company invests in research and development to maintain product formulations that comply with such laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to alter the chemical composition of one or more of the company s products in such a way that will not have an adverse effect upon the product s efficacy or marketability 
a delay or other inability of the company to complete product research and development in response to any such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a focus on environmental regulations relating to vocs volatile organic compounds resulted in a change in the formulation of the wd product in the majority of countries where the product is sold  whereby cowas chosen as the aerosol propellant in as a result of this change  the cost of manufacturing wd was increased and the company increased its selling prices to partially offset the additional cost 
in the event of future increases in product cost  the company may not be in a position to raise selling prices  and therefore an increase in costs could have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
voc s are regulated by the california air resources board carb 
current carb regulations  if applied  could require a reformulation of the wd product potentially resulting in a less efficient or less profitable product 
the company is seeking a variance from these requirements 
in the event that a variance is not obtained  the reformulation could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
generally  the manufacture  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products and the company s business operations all must comply with extensive federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations 
it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation  storage or use of certain chemicals  to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 
success of acquisitions the company has recently acquired the household product brands spot shot  flushes  x  and carpet fresh 
the company believes that its recent acquisitions provide opportunities for growth for all of the company s brands as well as increased efficiencies and cost savings in management  operations and marketing 
however  if the company is not able to successfully integrate acquired products  the company may not be able to maximize these opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
one of the company s strategies is to increase its sales volumes  earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of other businesses in the united states and internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into its operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 
increased use of debt financing the company has historically paid out a large part of its earnings to stockholders in the form of regular quarterly dividends 
the recent acquisitions have been funded to a large extent by new debt 
in order to service the new debt  the company will be required to use its income from operations to make interest and principal payments required by the terms of the loan documents 
in addition  the company is required by covenants within the loan documents to maintain certain financial ratios and compliance with other financial terms 
the company believes that the increased income from operations derived from the acquired businesses will fully cover the new debt service requirements 
in the past two years  the company has announced reductions to its regular quarterly dividend from to per share in april and from to per share in july reducing the annual dividend since april from to 
in order to make more of its cash flow available for debt service requirements 
however  if operating income is not sufficient to properly service the debt or otherwise allow the company to maintain compliance with the terms of its loans  the company could be required to seek additional financing through the issuance of more debt or the sale of equity securities  or the company might be required to further reduce dividends 
the increased debt service obligations could result in lower earnings for the company if anticipated gross and net margins are not maintained for the company s new and existing business lines 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  laws of some of the foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
volatility in the insurance market the company re evaluates its insurance coverage annually 
trends in the insurance industry suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive  less protective or even unavailable 
in such a case the company may decide to self insure more  thereby undertaking additional risks
