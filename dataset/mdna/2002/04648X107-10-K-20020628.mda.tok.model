item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of integrated automation systems for the semiconductor and related electronics manufacturing industries 
we design systems that enable semiconductor manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and protect their investment in silicon wafers during the manufacture of ics 
we sell our systems directly to semiconductor manufacturers  as well as to oems that integrate our systems with their equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
our sales are tied to capital expenditures at fabs and as such are cyclical in nature 
during fiscal  the worldwide demand for semiconductors continued its rapid decline 
the downturn  which began in the second half of fiscal  can be attributed to reduced worldwide demand for semiconductors and resulting decreases in capital spending for semiconductor manufacturing 
we have taken an aggressive approach to reducing fixed and variable cost during this downturn 
we have reduced our manufacturing facilities from eight to four 
we also reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
four reporting entities have been consolidated onto one enterprise resource planning system 
these actions have increased efficiency throughout the operation and reduced general and administrative costs 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of several product lines resulting in reduced fixed and variable cost while improving product cost 
our gross margins increased from negative in the third quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal on a three percent increase in sales 
as a result of the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry through the third quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a sales decline from the peak achieved in the third fiscal quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of million associated with additional inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories 
we do not believe that our customers will continue to purchase older versions of our mm products and mm products when capital spending resumes 
during the third quarter of fiscal we completed an assessment of the carrying value of long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of the significant negative industry and economic trends  we concluded that our carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired and took an impairment charge of million during the quarter 
during fiscal  we recorded million of non recurring charges associated with our shutdown of facilities  write down of assets and workforce reduction associated charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote down the value of land we own in fremont  california to market value  resulting in a million charge 
in addition to the changes in the business cycle impacting demand for our products  we continue to see a shift from mm to mm products 
in fiscal  mm products represented of revenues and of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to of revenues for fiscal and of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal the bookings ratio between mm and mm in the fourth quarter of fiscal is consistent with the sales ratio 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales increased  which represented the first increase in sales in five quarters 
bookings increased sequentially over the third fiscal quarter  which marked the first sequential increase in bookings for five quarters 
we use a dedicated direct sales force worldwide 
the use of distributors in europe ceased on december  our functional currency is the us dollar  except in japan where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
to date  the impact of currency translation gains or losses has not been material to our sales or results of operations 

table of contents acquisitions during the three fiscal years ended march   and through the date of this report  we acquired the following companies in may  acti  one of our subsidiaries  purchased the assets of dlc  a leading developer of software for tool communication and provider of a variety of consulting  development and integration services to its customers 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in may  we acquired gw  a developer of factory integration software used by electronics manufacturers 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in february  we acquired amp  a manufacturer of precision parts 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in february  we acquired semifab  a manufacturer of environmental control equipment and a contract manufacturer 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in  we acquired a majority ownership percentage of mecs  a japanese engineering and robotics manufacturing company  and in fiscal our ownership percentage increased to percent 
mecs is now merged into aji 
the transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in august  we acquired pat  which develops continuous flow transport systems for use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in june  we acquired all of the shares of pst  which manufactures wafer sorting equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers 
the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to include the financial statements of pst 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we changed our revenue recognition policy effective april   based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment 
we recognize revenue for these types of products at shipment 
some of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other 
table of contents elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
other products are highly customized systems that cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
we recognize revenue for spare parts on shipment 
we recognize revenue related to maintenance and service contracts ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities and other 
during the year ended march   we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million or a loss of per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  as of the beginning of the fiscal year  in accordance with the guidance provided in sab prior to the year ended march   we recognized revenue at the time the customer took title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts was recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
we account for software revenue recognition in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues for integration software work on a percentage of completion 
we recognize software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  when the software is shipped  payment is due within one year  collection is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts and a general reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
allowance for doubtful accounts was million at march  and million at march  inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are initially recorded based on an independent appraisal  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for some long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to expense long lived assets  which results in an equal amount of expense in each period 
additionally  pursuant to applicable accounting rules  we periodically assess whether long lived assets have been impaired 
we test for impairment by preparing an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the future use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we deem the asset to be impaired 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
additionally  our industry experiences significant sales fluctuations  impacting our future cash flow estimates 
this could result in significant unexpected impairment to certain long lived assets 
at march   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  recorded on our balance sheet 

table of contents accrued liabilities some of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
additionally  a component of our restructuring reserve related to a loss we expect to incur for excess leased facility space is based on numerous assumptions and estimates  such as the market value of the space and the time it will take to sublease the space 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
if our estimates are inaccurate due to incorrect assumptions or trends significantly different from historical experience  we may need to increase or decrease some accrued liabilities which could materially impact our financial results 
our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for months for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
we record the estimated warranty cost when we recognize revenue for our product 
we determine the estimated warranty cost based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
we routinely evaluate our contractual commitments with our customers and suppliers to determine if it is probable that a loss exists that can be estimated in fulfillment of the contractual commitment 
if so  we record a loss reserve and include it in accrued liabilities and other 
if actual fulfillment of a contractual commitment differs from our estimate  our financial results will be impacted  either favorably or unfavorably  upon fulfillment of the contract  or unfavorably upon a revised estimate that is more unfavorable than the previous estimate 
deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if  in the future  we can realize our deferred tax in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the valuation allowance  increasing income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we can not realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the valuation allowance  charging income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents fiscal years ended march   and the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets non recurring charges in process research and development costs of acquired business total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes income loss before effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net income loss net sales 
our net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  a decrease of million or percent from the prior year 
we believe that the decline in sales was in line with the semiconductor equipment sector 
the reduction in sales was directly attributable to the reduced capital spending of semiconductor manufacturers due to the general decline in demand for ic s 
sales in fiscal were million or percent greater than fiscal our increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal resulted from approximately million of net sales contributed by mecs  amp and semifab  which were not part of our consolidated results for fiscal  and continued growth in demand for our other products 
for the first quarter of fiscal we expect sales of million to million 
our net sales by geography were as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year ended march  united states taiwan japan europe other asia excluding japan and taiwan total 
table of contents direct sales to international customers declined as a percent of total sales during fiscal this was due to the fact that mm sales grew percent year over year and were largely shipped to us oems 
the increase in japan s share of our international net sales in fiscal is due to the fact that the japanese market lagged behind the downturn occurring in the rest of the world 
during fiscal  we achieved our first sales in malaysia to two new semiconductor manufacturers 
net sales to our european customers in fiscal grew by approximately percent compared to fiscal due to winning a smif technology mm project in germany 
as mm products comprise a higher percent of our net sales  over time we expect that us sales will continue to grow as a percent of total net sales 
this is because most of our mm products will be sold to oems  most of which are located in the united states and japan and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
during fiscal  we had one reportable segment 
the net sales by product or service categories comprising our net sales for the three fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year ended march  tool based solutions factory connectivity solutions wafer and reticle carriers services other total gross profit 
our gross profit was percent of net sales for fiscal  percent of net sales for fiscal and percent of net sales for fiscal gross profit in fiscal was negatively impacted by the percent decline in sales from fiscal to fiscal during the year ended march   we recorded a one time charge of million associated with additional inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories 
the charge was included in cost of sales 
during the year  management took aggressive actions to eliminate fixed costs by consolidating manufacturing facilities and adjusting variable cost to meet current manufacturing volumes 
the headcount reduction associated with manufacturing operations in fiscal was approximately our gross margin increased from negative percent  including the effect of the million one time charge for additional inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories  in the third fiscal quarter to percent in the fourth fiscal quarter 
gross margin in the third fiscal quarter was percent excluding the inventory reserve 
gross margin in fiscal was percent  down from percent in fiscal the decline in margin was primarily due to the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in mecs in late march  the increased sales of mm products and the need to take substantial inventory and loss reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the gross margin of percent was due to the combined effect of material cost reduction achieved through product re design efforts and the dramatically increased rate of absorption of fixed costs resulting from the percent increase in net sales over fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect that gross profit will be in the range of to percent of net sales and will continue to trend upward as sales volume increases 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  our dedication to developing new products is evident by the relatively minor reduction of percent in spending in compared to while sales declined percent 
our r d spending has been allocated to support the smif product series  the development of automated material handling technology for the mm market and the plus portal 
our r d expenses as a percent of net sales can vary significantly based on the level of net sales and our need to continue investing in r d activities to remain competitive 
we capitalize legal costs related to our patents 
costs related to research  design and development of software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility  generally in the form of a working model  of the product 
table of contents has been established  at which time these costs are capitalized  subject to net realizable value 
costs eligible for capitalization  incurred after achieving technological feasibility and before general release of the product  were not material for any periods presented 
accordingly  we have charged all software development costs to research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we expect our r d activities and related expenditures to increase in absolute dollars in future periods unless additional negative economic conditions impact the semiconductor industry 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in sg a of million in fiscal is attributable to cost reduction efforts and lower business volume 
the percent increase in sg a from fiscal to was due to the sales increase of percent as well as the acquisitions made during the preceding year and a half 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization expenses relating to acquired intangible assets were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  we amortize the acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from four to fourteen years 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fiscal year ended march   reducing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets to its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
no such charge was incurred in prior periods 
we tested for impairment by preparing an estimate of the future cash flows expected from the future use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we deem the asset to be impaired 
the testing was initiated in the quarter ended december  due to ongoing reductions in net sales and general weakness in the semiconductor equipment market 
based on this testing  we recorded the impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
we do not anticipate a further impairment charge to our remaining intangible assets in the foreseeable future  however a further deterioration in net sales  extended slump in net sales or significant reduction or cessation of net sales from one of our acquired businesses could result in a further impairment charge in a future period 
non recurring charges 
non recurring charges recorded were in thousands march  land impairment severance and benefits excess facilities contract cancellation reduction in estimate of prior year required reserve total land impairment 
we own land in fremont  california  which we are currently marketing for sale 
we had intended to construct corporate headquarters facilities on the land and subsequently decided not to build these facilities 
initially  we leased the land from a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to an original lease agreement and an amended lease agreement 
we purchased the land on october  for million  and we paid the syndicate of financial institutions approximately million for engineering costs incurred in preparation for making leasehold improvements to the land 
based upon 
table of contents market data at june   we estimated that the then market value of the land had been impaired and as such recorded a million write down to its estimated market value during the quarter ended june  restructuring 
non recurring restructuring charges were recorded associated with our plan to shut down some of our manufacturing and service locations  outsource some of our manufacturing activities and consolidate the remainder of our domestic manufacturing in fremont  california  as well as to reduce our workforce due to economic conditions 
these charges included approximately million in write downs of assets and reserves for lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income that we expect to generate from the vacated facilities  and severance costs of approximately million related to reductions in force of approximately employees or approximately of our workforce 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in response to a decrease in net sales and new orders  we incurred a million charge relating to the reduction in our employed workforce by regular full time employees and approximately temporary employees  primarily in fremont  california 
in addition  as of march   we accrued million relating to a plan to close a small manufacturing facility in japan 
we communicated the plan to the affected employees prior to march  in fiscal  in connection with the decision to move to a purely direct sales channel in japan  we paid million to cancel an agreement previously entered into to sell products in the japanese market 
additionally  during fiscal  a reduction of million was made to the restructuring reserve balance to adjust for revised estimates related to restructuring activities 
the following table summarizes our non recurring charges including restructuring activities for the fiscal year ended march   dollars in thousands land severance excess impairment and benefits facilities total balance at march  non recurring charges less non cash charges amounts paid in cash balance at march  we expect to utilize the remaining balance of approximately million during the fiscal year ended march   primarily with cash 
in process research and development of acquired business and product line 
on may   we acquired gw in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the purchase price allocation million was assigned to in process research and development costs of acquired business  or ipr d 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed the acquisition of pat and a majority interest in mecs 
in connection with the purchase price allocation of pat  we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs 
in connection with the purchase price allocation of mecs we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs 
in each acquisition  the amount allocated to ipr d was determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and was expensed upon acquisition  as we determined that the projects had not reached technological feasibility at the time of our acquisition and had no perceived alternative future uses 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to interest expense related to the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes on july  interest income declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower average 
table of contents cash balances and lower average interest rates 
other income expense  net increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a higher cash balance resulting in more interest income 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents an effective tax rate of percent for the fiscal year ended march   percent for the fiscal year ended march  and percent for the fiscal year ended march  in fiscal  we experienced a lower tax rate due to an impairment charge for goodwill and other long lived assets of million and a million ipr d charge  neither of which is deductible 
excluding these charges  our effective tax rate was a benefit of percent 
in fiscal  we experienced a lower effective tax rate compared to fiscal due to the impact in fiscal of non deductible in process research and development write offs related to the acquisitions of pat and mecs 
as of march   we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  of which approximately million relates to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits generated by us and our domestic subsidiaries  which expire at various dates through march  as of march   million of the deferred tax asset relates to pre merger foreign net operating loss carryforwards of mecs which expire in the utilization of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards is subject to the ability of mecs to generate future foreign taxable income 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been recorded related to pre merger net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the net deferred tax asset 
although we consider the net deferred tax asset realizable  actual amounts could be reduced if we do not achieve sufficient future taxable income 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit 
we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  or a loss of per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change to comply with sab as of the beginning of fiscal the deferred revenue recorded as a result of this accounting change was fully recognized in fiscal selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations for each of the eight quarterly periods ended march  you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we have prepared this unaudited consolidated information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements  reflecting all normal  recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the operating results for any quarter

business combinations  or sfas sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas discontinues amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
table of contents deemed to have indefinite lives and requires such assets to be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
sfas also includes provisions on the identification of intangible assets  reclassification of some intangibles from previously reported goodwill  and reassessment of the useful lives of existing intangibles 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  however  early adoption of sfas is permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after march   provided their first quarter financial statements have not been previously issued 
in all cases  sfas must be adopted at the beginning of a fiscal year 
we will apply sfas beginning in the first quarter of fiscal application of the non amortization provisions for goodwill and other intangible assets of sfas is expected to result in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million in fiscal we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is to screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal  and we do not expect the effect of these tests to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  or sfas  which addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs

we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities and public stock offerings  customer pre payments  bank borrowings and cash generated from operations 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash equivalents and short term investments  million in short term investments  million in working capital and million in long term debt and finance leases 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  reductions in payables and accrued liabilities totaling million  and a non cash benefit for deferred taxes of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges to net income including an impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a valuation reserve for land held for resale of million and an inventory reserve adjustment of million 
additionally  accounts receivable decreased by million and inventory balances decreased by million 
the reductions in payables and accrued liabilities  receivables and inventory all reflect reduced operations during fiscal resulting from substantially lower sales 
we expect these balances to increase during fiscal with increases in sales 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to our net income of million and non cash charges to net income including depreciation and amortization of million and inventory reserve adjustments of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million  primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaid expenses and other totaling million  partially offset by a decrease in other assets  net of million  increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other of million  our net income of million  tax benefit realized from employee stock option plan activity of million and non cash 
table of contents charges to net income including depreciation and amortization and purchased in process research and development totaling million 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was million 
we sold short term investments of million  net 
this source of cash was offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million and cash used in connection with our acquisition of gw of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
we used a total of million in connection with acquisitions of amp  semifab and additional ownership interest in mecs  and million to modify our facilities and purchase new equipment and furniture 
these uses were offset by sales or maturities of short term investments  net of purchases of short term investments and restricted cash equivalents  of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of million  million used in connection with the acquisitions of pat and mecs and million of purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible debt securities and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock programs 
these sources of cash were offset by net principal payments on short term and long term debt and finance leases of million 
during fiscal we issued stock in connection with our employee stock programs for an aggregate of million 
we made net principal payments on debt and finance leases of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily due to the issuance of million of common stock through a secondary public offering  private placement and employee stock plans 
we own land in fremont  california  which we are currently marketing for sale 
we had intended to construct corporate headquarters facilities on the land and subsequently decided not to build these facilities 
initially  we leased the land from a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to an original lease agreement and an amended lease agreement 
we purchased the land on october  for million  and we paid the syndicate of financial institutions approximately million for engineering costs incurred in preparation for making leasehold improvements to the land 
based upon market data at june   we estimated that the then market value of the land had been impaired and as such recorded a million write down to its estimated market value during the quarter ended june  we are currently attempting to sell this property 
the following table summarizes our significant commitments at march  in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years after years convertible subordinated notes secured straight bonds finance and operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations on july   we completed the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes which provided us with aggregate proceeds of million net of issuance costs 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature july   pay interest on january and july of each year and are redeemable at our option after july  the convertible subordinated notes are unsecured obligations  subject to certain non financial covenants 
at march   we were in compliance with all covenants under the convertible subordinated notes 
we had secured straight bonds from a bank in japan of japanese yen million  or million  at march  the bonds bore interest at rates ranging from percent to percent as of march  
table of contents and mature in fiscal year some of our assets in japan have been pledged as security for these secured straight bonds as well as for short term debt 
as of march   pledged assets consist of land and other property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  time deposits and accounts receivable totaling million 
we lease facilities under non cancelable finance and operating leases  with expiration dates ranging from september to june in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
for example  in may we signed a definitive agreement with shinko electric for the establishment of a joint venture 
under terms of the agreement  we will acquire of the joint venture for approximately billion japanese yen  or approximately million 
we currently anticipate pursuing additional funds to pay for our share of the joint venture  as well as to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes 
we anticipate that operating activities will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
the anticipated upturn in the semiconductor industry in fiscal may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to purchase inventory and expand our capacity prior to increased cash receipts from sales growth 
however  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements until the end of fiscal we currently anticipate pursuing additional funds in relation to pending acquisitions  to support our working capital and operating expense requirements  or for other purposes 
we anticipate raising these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
such financing may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all or  if available  on terms acceptable to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego acquisition opportunities which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy is limited by the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected due to an increase in interest rates
