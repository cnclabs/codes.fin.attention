item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
our consolidated financial statements for all periods account for palm as a discontinued operation  as a result of our decision to distribute the palm common stock we owned to com shareholders in the form of a stock dividend 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
subsequent to the distribution to shareholders on july   palm s operations ceased to be part of our operations and reported results 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are outlined within item as note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation revenue recognition we generally recognize a sale when the product has been delivered and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable considers whether a significant portion of the fee is due after its normal payment terms 
if we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue at the time the fee becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
also  sales arrangements  particularly with commworks customers  may contain product acceptance requirements that can impact the timing of the recognition of the related revenue 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not typically request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of the fee is not probable  then we will defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of payment 
a significant portion of our sales are to distributors and value added resellers 
revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales to these customers are recorded net of appropriate allowances  including estimates for product returns  price protection  and potentially excess channel inventory levels 
service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts  and geographic and political risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of may   our net accounts receivable balance was million 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or net realizable value 
cost is based on a first in  first out basis 
we review net realizable value of inventory  both on hand as well as for inventory that we are committed to purchase  in detail on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
as of may   our inventory balance was million 
goodwill and intangible assets we review the value of our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
during fiscal  we recognized million for write downs of goodwill and intangible assets 
as of may   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet  the value of which we believe is realizable based on the estimated future cash flows of the associated products and technology 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used  such as future sales and expense levels  in assessing that value may need to be reevaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of these assets 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities 
these plans have required us to utilize significant estimates related to held for sale properties  which resulted in both accelerated depreciation charges and write downs of those properties 
in addition  we have had to record estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  long term asset write downs  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed plan 
our policies  as supported by current authoritative guidance  require us to continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as management continues to evaluate the business  there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products for periods ranging from days to the lifetime of the product  depending upon the product  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
restructuring activities beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we undertook several initiatives aimed at both changing business strategy as well as improving operational efficiencies 
we recorded restructuring charges of million  million  and million in the fiscal years ended may   june   and june   respectively 
actions related to reduction in force and cost reduction efforts beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we restructured our operations to enhance the focus and cost effectiveness in serving our markets 
three independent businesses business connectivity company  business networks company  and commworks corporation were formed through this restructuring effort  with each business utilizing central shared corporate services 
as part of this restructuring effort  we implemented reductions in force and cost reduction actions aimed at expense and asset reduction  exited our consumer internet appliance  cable modem  and digital subscriber line dsl modem product lines  and increased our outsourcing of the manufacturing of high volume server  desktop and mobile connectivity products in a contract manufacturing arrangement 
concurrent with such outsourcing  we have been consolidating our real estate portfolio 
we sold our manufacturing and distribution facilities in singapore in fiscal  and plan to sell additional facilities in several locations in the united states 
for the fiscal years ended may  and june   we recorded charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to these restructuring initiatives 
we expect to incur additional charges in fiscal related to our continued cost reduction efforts  including the integration of bcc into bnc as announced in june although we are integrating bcc into bnc to realize cost savings from a common infrastructure  the basic connectivity division within bcc will be reported separately from the integrated bnc to internal management  including the chief operating decision maker 
as a result  the principal operating segments for fiscal will be business networks company  commworks  and connectivity division 
exit from the analog only modem and high end lan wan chassis product lines and separation of palm we realigned our strategy in the fourth quarter of fiscal to focus on high growth markets  technologies  and products 
in support of this strategy  we exited our analog only modem and high end lan and wan chassis product lines and completed the separation of palm 
for the fiscal years ended may  and june   we recorded a restructuring credit of million and a charge of million  respectively  relating to these activities 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded net restructuring charges of million  consisting of restructuring charges of approximately million  partially offset by a gain recognized upon receipt of a warrant to purchase common stock in extreme networks  inc  valued at million 
we also recorded a credit of million and charges of million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  related to the separation of palm 
we completed our restructuring activities associated with the exit of the analog only modem and high end lan and wan chassis product lines during fiscal business combinations and joint ventures we completed the following transactions during the fiscal year ended june  during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired the gigabit ethernet nic business of alteon websystems alteon  a wholly owned subsidiary of nortel  for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash paid to nortel of million and million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
we purchased the alteon nic business and are licensing certain gigabit ethernet related technology and intellectual property from alteon 
approximately million of the aggregate purchase price represented purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  and was charged to operations in the third quarter of fiscal a risk adjusted after tax discount rate of percent was applied to the in process project s cash flows 
this purchase resulted in million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over an estimated useful life of four years 
in fiscal  we determined that lower than anticipated revenue growth resulted in an impairment of the goodwill and developed product technology that arose from the acquisition of alteon 
these intangible assets were written down million to fair value  which was estimated using discounted future cash flows 
the impairment charge was included in amortization and write down of intangibles  and is a component of contribution margin for bcc as reported in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the analysis  we wrote down all of the alteon related goodwill and a portion of the alteon developed product technology 
remaining net intangible assets continue to be amortized over their original useful lives 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired nomadic technologies  inc nomadic  a developer of wireless networking products that we have incorporated into solutions for both small business and enterprise customers  for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash paid to nomadic of million  issuance of restricted stock with a fair value of million  stock options assumed with a fair value of million  and million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
for financial reporting purposes  the aggregate purchase price was reduced by the intrinsic value of unvested stock options and restricted stock totaling million  which was recorded as deferred stock based compensation and is being amortized over the respective vesting periods 
approximately million of the aggregate purchase price represented purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and was charged to operations in the second quarter of fiscal a risk adjusted after tax discount rate of percent was applied to the in process projects cash flows 
this purchase resulted in million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over estimated useful lives of three to five years 
finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized over their original useful lives  whereas remaining indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  but reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas  effective june  during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired kerbango  inc kerbango  developer of the kerbango internet radio  radio tuning system  and radio web site  for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash paid to kerbango of million  issuance of restricted stock with a fair value of million  stock options assumed with a fair value of million  and million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
in addition  deferred cash payments to founders and certain former employees totaling million were contingent upon certain events occurring through july for financial reporting purposes  the aggregate purchase price  excluding deferred cash payments  was reduced by the intrinsic value of unvested stock options and restricted stock totaling million  which was recorded as deferred stock based compensation and was being amortized over the respective vesting periods 
approximately million of the aggregate purchase price represented purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  and was charged to operations in the first quarter of fiscal a risk adjusted after tax discount rate of percent was applied to the in process project s cash flows 
this purchase resulted in million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over estimated useful lives of three to five years 
as part of our efforts to improve profitability  we announced that we would exit the internet appliance product line during fiscal year as a result  we determined that the net unamortized assets had no remaining future value and consequently wrote off the net remaining amounts of deferred stock based compensation  goodwill  and intangible assets 
this included million of accelerated amortization of deferred stock based compensation for qualified terminated kerbango employees and million of net goodwill and intangible assets related to the kerbango acquisition 
these charges were included as part of restructuring charges in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the transfer of our analog only modem product lines to us robotics corporation new usr  the new joint venture formed with accton and natsteel electronics 
we contributed million of assets to new usr for an investment in the joint venture 
new usr assumed the analog only modem product line  including us robotics and us robotics courier branded modems 
during fiscal  we wrote off our million investment in new usr as the value of this investment was determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the amount was charged to gains losses on investments  net 
we completed the following transactions during the fiscal year ended june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired call technologies  inc call technologies  a developer of unified messaging um and carrier class operational systems and support oss software solutions for service providers  for an aggregate purchase price of million  consisting of cash of approximately million  assumption of stock options with a fair value of approximately million  the assumption of million in debt  and million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
approximately million of the total purchase price represented purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and was charged to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal this purchase resulted in approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over estimated useful lives of three to seven years 
the weakened telecommunications industry conditions in fiscal and resulted in the impairments of the goodwill and related intangible assets that arose from the call technologies acquisition 
these assets were written down million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to fair value  which was estimated using discounted future cash flows 
the write down in fiscal related to goodwill and acquired customer relationships 
the fiscal write down included a portion of the developed technology and associated goodwill 
these impairment charges were included in amortization and write down of intangibles  and are components of contribution margin for commworks as reported in note of the consolidated financial statements 
remaining net finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized over their original useful lives  whereas remaining indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  but reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with our adoption of sfas  effective june  during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired lansource technologies  inc lansource  a developer of internet and lan fax software and modem sharing software  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  including million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
approximately million of the total purchase price represented purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use  and was charged to operations in the third quarter of fiscal this purchase resulted in approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over estimated useful lives of two to five years 
as part of our efforts to improve profitability in fiscal  we decided that we would exit certain lansource product lines and license the technology to a former competitor in that market 
as a result of this decision  we determined that an impairment of developed technology and related goodwill that arose from the lansource acquisition had occurred 
these assets were written down million to their estimated realizable fair value 
this amount was included in restructuring charges in fiscal also in fiscal  we determined that a customer s product line discontinuation resulted in an impairment of a license agreement and related goodwill that arose from the lansource acquisition 
those assets were determined to have no future value  and accordingly million was written off 
in fiscal  weakened telecommunications industry conditions indicated further impairment of lansource goodwill and intangible assets  primarily for core technology and related goodwill 
these assets were written down approximately million to fair value  which was estimated using discounted future cash flows 
the million and million impairment charges recorded in fiscal and  respectively  were included in amortization and write down of intangibles  and are components of contribution margin for commworks as reported in note of the consolidated financial statements 
remaining net finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized over their original useful lives  whereas remaining indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  but reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with our adoption of sfas  effective june  during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired interactive web concepts  inc iwc  an internet business consulting  creative design  and software engineering firm  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  including million of costs directly attributable to the completion of the acquisition 
this purchase resulted in approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets that were being amortized over estimated useful lives of three years 
as part of our efforts to improve profitability  we decided that we would discontinue providing iwc services during fiscal year as a result  we determined that the net unamortized assets had no remaining future value and consequently wrote off million  which was the net remaining amount of goodwill and intangible assets 
this amount was included in restructuring charges in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal years ended may  june  june  sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization and write down of intangibles restructuring charges losses gains on land and facilities  net purchased in process technology merger related credits  net total operating expenses operating income loss gains losses on investments  net litigation settlement interest and other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity interests income tax provision benefit other interests in loss of consolidated joint venture equity interest in loss of unconsolidated investee income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended may  and june  sales fiscal sales totaled  million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
during fiscal  our principal operating segments were business networks company  business connectivity company  and commworks 
business networks company 
sales of bnc products switches  hubs  networked telephony  wireless lans  and customer service and support in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
the decline in sales of bnc products  particularly in stackable and small business switches and hubs  when compared to fiscal was due primarily to weaker industry conditions as a result of the continued economic downturn 
additionally  bnc products in general experienced average selling price asp erosion due to increased competition 
service revenue decreased due to fewer maintenance contract renewals 
offsetting the general trend  bnc experienced an increase in sales of its stackable gigabit ethernet switching products 
sales of bnc products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal business connectivity company 
sales of bcc products wired and wireless nics and pc cards  lan on motherboard asics  and mini pci in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in sales of bcc products when compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower asps and declining unit sales 
factors that reduced asps were a shift in the market from nics and pc cards to the lower priced lom and mini pci form factors  an increase in the proportion of sales to oems  and pressure from increased competition 
unit sales also declined as lower priced form factors in particular the connectivity that is integrated into the bridgechip set of the pc began to replace nics and loms  and due to the economic downturn that started after the first quarter of fiscal these declines were partially offset by increased sales of our gigabit ethernet nic products  as more high end users demanded the faster connectivity available through gigabit products 
sales of bcc products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal as the market shifts towards the lom form factor  we expect a continued downward trend in the sales of bcc products  due partially to the lower asps generated by these products  but more significantly due to our overall lower market share in this segment of the market 
commworks 
sales of commworks products hardware platforms for wireline and wireless access  software and softswitch elements that enable services to be delivered over these platforms  and professional services for network service providers in fiscal were million  a decrease of approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal the decline in sales compared to a year ago was experienced in both wireline and wireless products  and was due to significantly weakened market conditions in the telecommunications industry  resulting in significantly reduced capital expenditures by telecommunications carriers and service providers and  as a result  reduced purchases of our wireline and wireless access products 
sales of commworks products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal the amounts and timing of future capital expenditures by carriers and service providers is highly uncertain in light of the current depressed industry market conditions  and we do not anticipate any significant improvement in overall industry market conditions in the near future 
exited product lines 
sales of exited product lines consumer cable and dsl modem products  analog only modems  high end lan and wan chassis products  and internet appliances in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the majority of fiscal sales of exited products took place in the first fiscal quarter 
this substantial elimination of sales of these products was due to our change in strategic focus 
we will  however  recognize revenue relating to these products in fiscal that was deferred as of may  sales of exited products represented one percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal geographic 
us sales represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal  and decreased percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal decreased percent when compared to fiscal the overall decline in both us and international sales is largely attributable to the worldwide deteriorating economic conditions  especially in the telecommunications industry 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal gross margin improved seven percentage points due to reductions in period costs  which were higher in fiscal as a result of provisions for excess and obsolete inventory due to reduced demand and the discontinuation of our consumer product lines 
gross margin improved four percentage points due to increases in standard margins 
standard margin improved primarily due to the discontinuation of low margin consumer products and cost reductions in bnc products 
these improvements were partially offset by increased price competition and a mix shift towards lower margin bcc oem products 
gross margin improved three percentage points in fiscal due primarily to the elimination of minimum volume purchase commitments with subcontract manufacturers that we incurred in fiscal sales of previously written off inventory did not materially improve gross margin in fiscal operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were  million  or percent of sales  compared to  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal excluding amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of million  and net losses on land and facilities of million  operating expenses were million  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of million  net gains on land and facilities of million  purchased in process technology charges of million  and net merger related credits of million  operating expenses were  million  or percent of sales for fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to lower selling expenses resulting from the decrease in sales  the exit of product lines associated with our restructuring activities  reduced headcount  and other cost reduction efforts 
in addition  fiscal had higher than normal spending for corporate branding programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal were relatively flat as compared to fiscal the year over year decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to headcount reductions and cost reduction efforts  especially in our discontinued and mature product lines 
we expect research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in future periods as we consolidate our projects into a fewer number of lower cost locations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to decreased headcount  cost reduction efforts  and lower legal expenses relating to patent prosecution 
in fiscal there were fewer new patent filings because of reduced research and development activities 
the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was due to our inability to reduce fixed costs at the same rate as our decline in sales 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in future periods 
amortization and write down of intangibles 
amortization and write down of intangibles in fiscal of million increased million  compared to million in fiscal charges in fiscal included million of write downs for impairment of intangibles and million of amortization 
impairment charges in fiscal include million for goodwill and developed product technology related to the alteon acquisition  million for goodwill and acquired customer relationships related to the call technologies acquisition  and million related primarily to core technology and related goodwill that arose from the lansource acquisition 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis effects of recent accounting pronouncements  we adopted sfas at the beginning of fiscal while we are still in the process of determining the impact of impairment losses  if any  arising from the initial application of sfas  the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets ceased as of june  at the time of our adoption of sfas  assuming no future impairments  amortization for fiscal will be approximately million 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal and fiscal  we undertook several initiatives aimed at both changing business strategy as well as improving operational efficiencies 
restructuring charges in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
expenses for fiscal included million for facility related charges  comprised of million for accelerated depreciation on our mount prospect facility  million in write downs of held for sale property  million for the loss on the sale of our singapore manufacturing facility  and million for other facility charges  million for severance and outplacement costs  million for long term asset write downs  and million for other restructuring charges 
these charges were the result of both cost reduction actions we took to restructure our operations that were announced on december   consolidation of our manufacturing facilities and the discontinuation of our consumer cable and dsl modem product lines as announced during june  and continued efforts to improve our cost structure 
the write downs of held for sale property in fiscal related to our mount prospect facility and a portion of the santa clara campus 
depreciation is stopped on held for sale properties  and any related rental income is recorded as an offset to operating expenses  as is all rental income 
rental income for both owned and leased properties was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
we have properties held for sale in santa clara  mount prospect  and salt lake city  and the total net book value of assets associated with these properties was million as of may  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we sold our mount prospect property in the first quarter of fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal were due to both our restructuring plans announced on december   as well as our exit of our analog only modem and high end lan and wan chassis product lines 
losses gains on land and facilities  net 
net loss on land and facilities was million for fiscal this was due to the write down of held for sale property in salt lake city that was classified as such prior to the inception of our restructuring program 
during fiscal  com finalized the sale of a acre parcel of undeveloped land in san jose  california to a financial institution as directed by palm for total net proceeds of approximately million 
com recorded a net gain of million related to this sale 
in february  com sold a vacated office and manufacturing building in morton grove  illinois for total net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
gains losses on investments  net during fiscal  net losses on investments were million  comprised of million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of other than temporary declines in value of investments in private companies  offset by million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities 
in fiscal  net losses on investments were million  comprised of million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs of other than temporary declines in value of both publicly traded securities and investments in private companies  offset by million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease of million compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash and short term investment balances as well as lower interest rates  plus higher interest expense due to borrowings on our term loan and revolving line of credit  partially offset by million of interest income on a tax refund received in the second quarter of fiscal income tax provision benefit our income tax expense was percent of our pre tax loss in fiscal  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of percent in fiscal our fiscal expense is due to providing income taxes in foreign and state jurisdictions and the write down of the domestic deferred tax asset that had been supported by the appreciation in our real estate portfolio 
however  due to the decline in the commercial real estate market  realization became uncertain and this tax asset was written down during fiscal at may   the remaining net deferred tax asset reflects foreign deductible temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized by our foreign subsidiaries 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  sales fiscal sales totaled  million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
business networks company 
sales of bnc products in fiscal were  million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
the decrease in sales of bnc products when compared to fiscal was due primarily to our stackable and modular switch products and professional service revenue 
the decrease in product sales was due to weaker industry conditions as a result of the economic downturn 
we also experienced asp erosion due to increased competition 
in addition  the exiting of our large  complex chassis products at the end of fiscal and cost reduction efforts in fiscal also resulted in disruptions in sales of our ongoing products 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by growth in new product and market segments such as gigabit switching  lan telephony and wireless lans 
professional service revenue decreased due to fewer integration and consulting projects 
the decrease in projects was attributable to both the decline in sales of products and a shift in product mix towards solutions that were easier to install 
sales of bnc products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal business connectivity company 
sales of bcc products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
the decrease in sales of bcc products when compared to fiscal was due primarily to sharp declines in asps 
decreases in asps were caused by a product transition from nics and pc cards to lom and mini pci form factors and pricing pressures from oem partners 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by growth in gigabit nics  with the penetration of this market partially aided by the fiscal acquisition of alteon 
sales of bcc products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal commworks 
sales of commworks products in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of million 
the decrease in sales of commworks products when compared to fiscal was due primarily to the slowdown in the telecommunications industry  which resulted in a significant decline in revenues from our wireline products  partially offset by growth of our wireless products 
sales of commworks products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal exited product lines 
sales of exited product lines in fiscal were million  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of  million

us sales represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and decreased percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal decreased percent when compared to fiscal the overall decline in both us and international sales was largely attributable to the worldwide deteriorating economic conditions  especially in the telecommunications industry 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal gross margin declined ten percentage points in fiscal due to reductions in standard margin 
the decline in standard margin was primarily caused by a mix shift to lower margin commercial access and consumer broadband modem products and eroding prices on lan infrastructure  nic  and pc card products 
gross margin declined eight percentage points in fiscal resulting from higher provisions for excess and obsolete inventory due to reduced demand and the discontinuation of our consumer product lines 
gross margin declined six percentage points in fiscal due to underutilized capacity in our manufacturing plants and commitment shortfalls with subcontract manufacturers 
we also recorded a liability related to future contractual commitments with a subcontract manufacturer as a result of our intention to exit our consumer product lines and the reduction in sales demand 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were  million  or percent of sales  compared to  million  or percent of sales in fiscal excluding amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of million  net gains on land and facilities of million  purchased in process technology charges of million  and net merger related credits of million  operating expenses were  million  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding amortization and write down of intangibles of million  restructuring charges of million  net gains on land and facilities of million  purchased in process technology charges of million  and net merger related credits of million  operating expenses were  million  or percent of sales for fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million or percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was attributable to lower selling expenses resulting from the decease in sales  the exit of product lines associated with our restructuring activities  reduced headcount  and other cost reduction efforts 
these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on corporate advertising and brand recognition programs 
the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was affected by the decline in sales greater than the decrease in sales force and related expenses as described above 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to headcount reductions and cost reduction efforts  especially in our discontinued and mature product lines

the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was affected by the decline in sales in fiscal  as described above 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million or percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to decreased headcount  cost reduction efforts  and lower consulting costs associated with our restructuring activities

during fiscal  com finalized the sale of a acre parcel of undeveloped land in san jose  california to a financial institution as directed by palm for total net proceeds of approximately million 
com recorded a net gain of million related to this sale 
in february  com sold a vacated office and manufacturing building in morton grove for total net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
during fiscal  we sold our manufacturing facility and related assets in salt lake city and recognized an impairment charge for our remaining salt lake city facility held for sale  which together resulted in a net gain of million 
purchased in process technology 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million associated with the acquisitions of certain assets of alteon  nomadic  and kerbango 
we continued to develop technologies that were in process at alteon  nomadic  and kerbango as of the dates of the acquisitions 
the fair values of the existing products and technology currently under development were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
the costs to be incurred for the projects in process were primarily labor costs for design  prototype development  and testing 
as of the acquisition dates  purchased in process technology was approximately complete for alteon projects and complete for both kerbango and nomadic projects 
we continued development of nine projects  and spent approximately million  million and million on alteon  kerbango and nomadic projects  respectively  as of june  at the end of fiscal  all purchased in process technology projects were completed or terminated 
merger related credits charges  net 
during fiscal  we recorded net pre tax merger related credits of approximately million 
this net amount reflects adjustments to previously recorded merger and restructuring charges 
gains losses on investments  net net losses on investments of million were recorded during fiscal  comprised of million of net losses recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and write downs for other than temporary declines in value of both publicly traded securities and investments in private companies  offset by million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities 
during fiscal  gains on investments were million  comprised of million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities and million of net gains recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and in private companies acquired by public companies 
litigation settlement we recorded a charge of million during fiscal for the settlement of the reiver and adler cases  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase of million compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest income  attributable to higher average cash and short term investment balances  as well as higher interest rates 
income tax provision our effective income tax benefit rate was percent in fiscal compared to an effective income tax expense rate of percent in fiscal the fiscal benefit rate was comprised of a tax benefit on the united states federal tax loss  offset by tax provisions in certain foreign countries  a valuation allowance on deferred taxes  and non deductible expenses related to acquisitions 
the valuation allowance reduced deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
the valuation allowance related to a portion of the credit and net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences for which we believed that realization was uncertain due to various limitations on their use and our operating losses 
equity interest in loss of unconsolidated investee in fiscal  we invested million in omnisky corporation omnisky 
this investment was accounted for using the equity method  resulting in losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations includes the results of operations of palm 
income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and equivalents and short term investments at may  were  million  a decrease of approximately million from  million at june  for the fiscal year ended may   net cash used in operating activities was million 
cash flows used in operating activities resulted primarily from the net loss of million  partially offset by non cash expenses 
accounts receivable at may  decreased million from june  due primarily to the decrease in sales from the prior year 
days sales outstanding in net receivables decreased to days at may   compared to days at june   due primarily to improved collection efforts and a higher percentage of sales occurring during the last month of the fiscal year ended june  compared to sales in the last month of the fiscal year ended may  inventory levels at may  decreased million from the prior fiscal year end due to increasing our outsourced manufacturing and improved supply chain cycle time 
other assets at may  decreased million from june   primarily due to the collection of non trade receivables and the return of a million long term deposit from the singapore government related to the sale of our singapore facility 
net deferred tax assets at may  decreased million from june   primarily due to the write down of our deferred tax assets 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other at may  decreased million from june   primarily attributable to payments of manufacturing commitments  decreases in inventory purchases due to the outsourced manufacturing and better inventory management  reduced payroll and related accruals for the payment of severance and decreased headcount  and lower deferred revenue balances associated with reduced service maintenance contracts 
income taxes receivable payable changed million  mainly due to the collection of a million income tax refund 
for the fiscal years ended may  and june   we made investments totaling million and million  respectively  in municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments  as well as investments totaling million and million  respectively  in equity securities 
for the fiscal years ended may  and june   proceeds from maturities and sales of municipal and corporate bonds and government agency instruments were million and  million  respectively  and proceeds from the sales of equity investments totaled million and million  respectively 
as part of com ventures  we selectively make strategic investments in privately held companies and in limited partnership venture capital funds  which in turn invest in privately held companies 
frequently  we also have a strategic commercial or technology relationship  such as a component supply agreement or technology license arrangement  with these privately held companies 
we believe these investments complement our business strategies and research and development efforts 
under com ventures  as of may  we are committed to make additional capital contributions to certain limited partnership venture capital funds totaling million  of which we expect approximately million to be called over the next twelve months 
during fiscal  we made investments through com ventures of million  which is included in our million of investments in equity securities discussed above 
for the fiscal year ended may   we made million in capital expenditures  of which million related to the purchase of properties that were under operating lease arrangements  and thereby terminated those leases 
the purchase of these properties was partially financed through borrowings under new financing arrangements  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
as of may   million was outstanding on the term loan  million of which will be paid in the next months  and million in net borrowings had been made on the revolving line of credit 
these financing arrangements are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we collected proceeds of million for the sale of property and equipment  of which million related to the sale of our singapore facility and the remaining million related to other fixed asset disposals 
as of may   capital expenditure commitments were insignificant 
also  as of may   we had approximately million of commitments relating to royalty and patent licenses whose technologies are incorporated into our products 
these commitments extend through may  and million of these commitments is expected to be paid over the next months 
we have several agreements whereby we have sold product to resellers who have  in turn  sold the product to end users  and we have guaranteed the payments of the end users to our customers 
if all end users under these agreements were to default on their payments  as of may  we would be required to pay approximately million 
as deferred revenue associated with such sales approximates the guaranteed amounts  any payments resulting from end user defaults would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
during the year ended may   we received net cash of million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans  and used million to repurchase million shares of our own common stock 
there are no assurances that we can reduce losses from operations and negative cash flow or raise capital as needed to fund the operations of the company 
however  based on current plans and business conditions  but subject to the discussion in the business environment and industry trends  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents  short term investments  revolving line of credit  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june and june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
we adopted sfas on june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our current financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principals board apb opinion  business combinations  and sfas  accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method  modifies the criteria for recognizing intangible assets  and expands disclosure requirements 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  we adopted sfas on june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of operations or statements of financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion  intangible assets 
sfas addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  sfas expands the disclosure requirements about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition 
impairment losses for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of sfas are to be reported as a change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas on june  and ceased amortization of net goodwill totaling million  which includes million of acquired workforce intangible previously classified as purchased intangible assets 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and statements of financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas on june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of operations or statements of financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  business environment and industry trends our future business and results of operations are subject to industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could cause future results to materially differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements include those discussed below our business has been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to a technology industry slowdown and impacted our business resulting in reduced demand for most of our products  increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities and manufacturing capacity  and higher overhead costs  as a percentage of revenues 
recent political and social turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
these political  social and economic conditions and uncertainties make it extremely difficult for com  our customers and our vendors to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
this reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably or to increase revenues 
in particular  it is difficult to develop and implement strategies  sustainable business models and efficient operations  and effectively manage outsourced relationships for certain contract manufacturing and information technology services 
if the current economic or market conditions continue or further deteriorate  there could be additional material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
we have recently consolidated two of our businesses business connectivity company and business networks company into a single business in fiscal year  we completed a restructuring of our commercial networking operations into three independent businesses com business connectivity company  com business networks company and commworks corporation 
each business has a dedicated management team focusing on developing and executing its own business strategies  assessing and meeting the needs of its customers and implementing sustainable efficient operations 
in addition  each business utilizes certain centrally provided  shared corporate services 
at the beginning of fiscal  we announced plans to consolidate two of these businesses bcc and bnc into a single business to gain further benefits from leveraging common resources 
failure to properly manage the consolidation of bcc and bnc into a new  single business networks company may adversely affect revenues  compromise results of operations or materially impair our overall financial performance 
we face operational risks in implementing our strategy to evaluate and implement the outsourcing of certain functions  which do not differentiate our ability to compete successfully and achieve profitable growth we are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing certain functions or operations that do not differentiate com or create a competitive advantage for our company supporting profitable growth 
this outsourcing strategy has included certain software development for it applications and outsourcing a substantial portion of com s it infrastructure 
implementation of such outsourcing may not result in reduction of actual costs associated with such services or function and may increase risk of disruption of operations upon which we rely on third parties to meet our needs 
moreover  future events are unpredictable and there may be substantial penalties for terminating agreements early or failing to maintain minimum service levels 
we face operational risks in consolidating our research and development design centers as part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts in our commworks business  we are consolidating our research and development activities from seven design centers into three design centers in the us  canada and india 
these consolidation activities involve significant changes in employment and transfers of product development efforts among design centers 
failure to properly manage the consolidation activities may result in disruptions to our product development programs which  in turn  may adversely impact the cost or timing of introducing new or enhanced products  revenues or overall financial performance 
cost containment and expense reductions are critical to achieving positive cash flow from operations and profitability we are continuing efforts to reduce our expense structure 
we believe strict cost containment and expense reductions are essential to achieving positive cash flow from operations in future quarters and returning to profitability  especially since the outlook for future quarters is subject to numerous challenges 
additional measures to contain costs and reduce expenses may be undertaken if revenues and market conditions do not improve 
a number of factors could preclude us from successfully bringing costs and expenses in line with our revenues  such as our inability to accurately forecast business activities and further deterioration of our revenues 
if we are not able to effectively reduce our costs and achieve an expense structure commensurate with our business activities and revenues  we may have inadequate levels of cash for operations or for capital requirements  which could significantly harm our ability to operate the business 
we face increased competition and our financial performance and future growth depend upon sustaining market positions in our existing markets and successfully targeting new markets we face competitive challenges that are likely to arise from a number of factors  including industry volatility resulting from rapid development and maturation of technologies  industry consolidation resulting in competitors with greater financial  marketing and technical resources  greater competition for fewer customers as a result of consolidation in the reseller and distribution channels as well as consolidation in the telecommunications service provider market due to excess capacity and the financial difficulties being experienced by some service providers  increasing price competition in the face of weakening economic conditions  excess inventories and excess capacity in the telecommunications service provider market  and continuing silicon integration of networking products 
we compete in three specific markets that serve enterprise and telecommunications service provider customers 
our principal competitors in the enterprise networking market include avaya  cisco  enterasys  extreme  hp  lucent  and nortel 
in the connectivity segment  our principal competitor is intel  other competitors include accton  broadcom  d link  linksys and netgear 
principal competitors in the telecommunications service provider market include cisco  comverse  lucent  nortel  and sonus 
our competitors range from large  diversified telecommunications equipment and networking companies to smaller companies with a more specialized focus 
as siliconization continues and networking functions become more embedded on the motherboard  we are increasingly facing competition from parties who are also our current suppliers of products 
our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
likewise  integration of networking  communications  and computer processing functionality on a reduced number of semiconductor components may adversely affect our future sales growth and operating results 
we are investing a significant proportion of our resources in various emerging product lines 
these emerging product lines include gigabit ethernet technology  ip telephony  cdma wireless networking products and services  softswitch technologies  wireless lans  layer switching  network security technology such as our embedded firewall products and network jack switches 
we expect these product lines to account for a higher percentage of our future sales over time  although the markets for these products and solutions are still emerging and may not develop to our expectations 
industry standards for some of these technologies are yet to be widely adopted and the market potential remains unproven 
if the markets for these new technologies or products do not develop or grow as we expect  or if we have not adopted optimal sales and go to market strategies for these new technologies and products  our financial results could be adversely affected and we might need to change our business strategy 
also  in the markets in which we compete  products have short life cycles and rapid technology transitions 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to identify new market and product opportunities  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  to gain market acceptance of new products  particularly in our targeted emerging markets  and to rapidly and efficiently transition our customers from older to newer connectivity technologies 
additionally  as we increase our reliance on relationships with strategic partners  such as odms  we may encounter greater difficulties in quickly and effectively introducing new products with the quality  functionality  costs and features that are optimal for the market 
this increased reliance may also limit our ability to independently identify current product and technology trends and respond to such trends 
any delay in new product introductions  lower than anticipated demand for our new products  failure to meet market needs for features or functionality or higher manufacturing costs could have an adverse affect on our operating results or financial condition  particularly in those product markets we have identified as emerging high growth opportunities 
future cash requirements or restrictions on cash could adversely impact our financial position  and an event of default under the credit facility may impair our ability to conduct business operations we incurred net losses in fiscal our overall cash balance declined and we may continue incurring negative overall cash flow in the next few quarters 
if cash flow deteriorates  our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be severely adversely impacted 
additionally  our ability to raise financial capital may be hindered due to our net losses and negative cash flow position  reducing our operating flexibility 
the following items could require unexpected future cash payments  limit our ability to generate cash or restrict our use of cash triggering of certain payment obligations  breach of covenants or acceleration of payment obligations under our new revolving and term loan facilities  inability to dispose of real estate holdings in a timely manner or at our anticipated price  taxes due upon the transfer of cash held in foreign locations  and taxes assessed by local authorities where we conduct business 
during fiscal  we entered into a  revolving and term loan facility with a syndication of financial institutions led by bank of america the credit facility and  contemporaneously  we retired all of our operating lease arrangements we had with respect to certain of our real properties 
the credit facility has a term of three years and is secured by priority liens over certain assets including inventory  accounts receivable  plant and equipment and certain real properties  but specifically excludes our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  equity investments and intellectual property 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the primary financial covenant under the credit facility obligates us to maintain million of available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
falling below million would be an event of default and  among other things  i bank of america may accelerate the payment of the complete facility  ii use of cash in certain bank accounts will be severely restricted  and iii significant operational constraints such as limitations on selling assets and funding certain operations  will automatically take effect 
we also have the ability to prepay and terminate the credit facility at any time 
while we plan to adhere to the financial covenants of the credit facility and avoid an event of default  in the event that it appears we are unable to avoid an event of default  it may be necessary or advisable to retire and terminate the credit facility and pay all remaining balances borrowed 
such payment of the credit facility would further limit our available cash and cash equivalents 
furthermore  we may not be able to retire the credit facility if we do not have adequate resources available when necessary to avoid an event of default or if  because of a rapid decline in revenues and cash and cash equivalents  we do not have adequate time to retire the credit facility 
the consequences of an event of default under the credit facility may prevent us from conducting normal business operations 
as we continue our efforts to consolidate our real estate portfolio and liquidate certain real estate holdings that we occupy or lease to third parties  we may enter into other financial arrangements  such as sale leaseback or mortgage arrangements that may subject us to additional financial covenants and restrictions  thereby further reducing our operating flexibility 
notwithstanding the foregoing  because of the economic conditions in the us and the fact that much of our real estate holdings are in areas such as silicon valley and boston s route corridor that have been particularly hard hit by the technology industry slowdown  our ability to consolidate and liquidate our holdings or to use our real estate to support other financial arrangements to gain additional liquidity is impaired 
additionally  to the extent that we continue to own excess facilities and are not able to lease the facilities  we will be adversely affected through continuing to bear the operating costs associated with these properties and the inability to generate rental income 
we maintain substantial cash deposits in foreign locations  portions of which may be subject to significant tax or tax withholding upon transfer or withdrawal 
furthermore  we regularly engage in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions where we operate about our tax positions 
while we believe our tax positions in these various jurisdictions are proper and fully defensible  these tax authorities may nevertheless assess taxes and render judgments against us if we are unable to convince them of our position 
in such an event  we could be required to make unexpected cash payments in satisfaction of such assessments or judgments or incur additional expenses to defend our position 
the above cash requirements or restrictions could lead to an inadequate level of cash for operations or for capital requirements  which could have a material negative impact on our financial position and significantly harm our ability to operate the business 
retaining key employees and management are critical to our success our success depends upon retaining and recruiting highly qualified employees and management personnel 
this is especially important in our current operating structure involving two independent businesses  since each management team must possess the skills  experience and talent to run its business on an independent basis 
however  like many companies in the industries in which we operate  we face challenges in attracting and retaining highly qualified employees and management personnel 
in june  we announced changes in the executive leadership positions for our commworks business segment and our finance organization 
in addition  the significant downturn in our business environment has had a negative impact on our operations  and as a result  we have restructured our operations to reduce our workforce and implement other cost reduction activities 
although we believe these various changes and actions will improve our organizational effectiveness and competitiveness  they could lead  in the short term  to disruptions in our business  reduced employee morale and productivity  increased attrition and problems with retaining existing employees and recruiting future employees and increased financial costs 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including engineers  sales representatives and product marketing managers  continues to be difficult 
at certain locations where we operate the cost of living is extremely high and it may be difficult to attract and retain key employees and management personnel at a reasonable cost 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain such persons  our product introduction schedules  customer relationships  operating results and financial condition may become impaired and our overall ability to compete may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a small number of customers who may decide not to purchase our products in the future we distribute many of our enterprise connectivity and networking products through two tier distribution channels that include distributors  systems integrators and value added resellers 
we also sell to pc oems and telecommunications service providers 
for enterprise connectivity and networking products  a significant portion of our sales is concentrated among a few distributors and oem customers 
there has been a recent trend of decreased demand for connectivity products from oem customers such as dell computer corp 
dell and hp  due to increased siliconization of networking connections and also to factors specific to our oem customers  such as the effort necessary for hp to complete merger integration following its recent acquisition of compaq computer corporation 
additionally  consolidation in our distribution channels and among pc oems is reducing the number of customers in the domestic and international markets 
in an effort to streamline our operations  we may increase the focus of our distribution sales resources on selected distribution channel customers 
for commworks products  a significant portion of our sales is concentrated with the major telecommunications service providers 
we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels  particularly in light of the serious challenges confronting the worldwide telecommunications industry 
such challenges are causing telecommunications service providers to experience serious credit problems and other financial difficulties and may result in far fewer companies surviving  thereby reducing competition and negatively impacting the amount and timing of purchases of telecommunications infrastructure equipment from suppliers such as us 
our results of operations  financial condition  or market share could be adversely affected if our customers stop purchasing our products or focus more on buying or reselling our competitors products  reduce  delay  or cancel their orders or defer implementation of new emerging technologies and products  or experience competitive  operational  or financial difficulties  impairing our ability to collect payments from them 
we depend on distributors who could negatively affect our operations by reducing the level of our products in their inventory our distributors maintain inventories of our products 
we work closely with our distributors to monitor channel inventory levels and ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to resellers and end users 
notwithstanding such efforts  if our channel partners reduce their levels of inventory of our products or if they do not maintain sufficient levels of inventory of our products to meet customer demand  our sales could be negatively impacted 
changes in sales channel mix to pc oems and product mix to lower margin connectivity products may negatively impact our revenues and margins we sell our connectivity products to pc oems  pc odms who sell to pc oems  and to distributors who  in turn  sell to commercial enterprises 
sales to distributors typically generate higher asps and gross margins than sales to pc oems 
the trend in sales for our enterprise connectivity products over the past several years has been a shift from two tier distribution to pc oems and odms  with the result that our revenue from distribution sales has decreased as a percentage of our total revenues 
this mix shift towards pc oems and odms has lowered the asps for our products 
if this trend continues and we cannot lower our costs of the products or transition customers to products with higher asps  then our margins will be reduced and our financial results will be adversely impacted 
we derive a significant portion of our sales of connectivity products from pc oems such as dell  gateway  inc  hp and ibm  all of which companies are manufacturers that incorporate our nics  pc cards  mini pci  and asic products into their products 
these companies also have begun utilizing chip sets that contain integrated ethernet lan connectivity solutions into their products 
as ethernet connectivity technology continues to mature  we have seen the incorporation of nic  pc card  and mini pci product features into lower priced form factors such as lom and integrated into the chip sets on the motherboard 
certain competitors that have a significant share of the pc chip set market may be bundling such pc chip sets with integrated lan connectivity at little or no price premium to pc chip sets without lan connectivity 
this bundling of pc chip sets and lan connectivity will have an adverse impact on competition in the lan connectivity market  including a significant negative impact on our ability to sell lan connectivity solutions to our existing pc oem or odm customers 
we expect that pc oems and odms increasingly will purchase the lower priced form factors of connectivity products 
if we cannot lower our costs of the products or transition customers to products with higher asps  then our margins will be reduced and our financial results will be adversely impacted 
continued slowdown of capital expenditures in the telecommunications industry may negatively impact commworks revenues commworks customers in the telecommunications service provider market include ilecs  ixcs  ptts  clecs  wireless service operators  internet service providers isps and other alternative service providers 
the deteriorating economic conditions prevailing in the telecommunications industry over the past several quarters including lower revenue growth  lower prices and excess capacity have combined to exert downward pressure on service provider margins and profitability and have resulted in decreased levels of capital expenditures for new equipment and services 
moreover  the challenges presented by the current industry environment are causing many telecommunications service providers to experience serious credit problems and other financial difficulties and could result in additional bankruptcies and consolidations 
a continuation or worsening of the current depressed economic conditions in the telecommunications industry could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and overall financial performance 
revenues from sales of our commworks products are subject to substantial fluctuations from period to period 
such fluctuations are the result of several factors characteristic of the commworks business  including the relatively small number of key customers  the relatively high dollar amount of each sale transaction  the relatively high percentage that each sale transaction represents in relation to commworks total revenues and the uncertainty related to the timing of individual sales transactions 
in addition to contributing to fluctuations in commworks reported revenues from period to period  these factors have made it difficult to forecast commworks future revenues 
also  commworks sales arrangements frequently contain product acceptance requirements that can impact the timing of the recognition of the sale 
for these reasons  revenues in any particular quarter from sales of our commworks products may be more prone to and adversely affected by operational decisions of individual customers 
our increased reliance on contract manufacturing and our excess manufacturing capacity may adversely impact our financial results and operations 
we have changed our manufacturing strategy so that more of our products will be sourced from contract manufacturers 
we have sold or are in the process of selling manufacturing operations and facilities associated with those products now sourced from contract manufacturers 
therefore  our ability to resume internal manufacturing operations for those products is severely limited 
the cost  quality  performance and availability of contract manufacturing operations are and will be essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products 
the inability of any contract manufacturer to meet our cost  quality  performance and availability standards could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to provide contract manufacturers with product volumes that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings 
if shipments fall below forecasted levels  we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of the inventory 
also  our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner  which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the smooth transition from internal manufacturing to contract manufacturing by a third party is critical to our success 
failure to implement and manage a successful transition may cause severe disruptions in our supply chain that will affect the cost  quality and availability of products 
in july  our primary contract manufacturer for commworks products  msl  announced its intentions to cease manufacturing operations at the mount prospect facility 
as a result of this announcement  we are evaluating our options with respect to manufacturing of commworks products in the future  including possible transfer of our manufacturing requirements to msl s facility in arden hills  minnesota and entering into new contract manufacturing arrangements with alternative suppliers 
failure to implement and manage a successful transition could disrupt commworks supply chain and adversely affect its revenues  the availability  cost and quality of its products  and its overall financial performance 
we are implementing a direct ship program in a phased manner with our manufacturing partners 
through this program  we will be relying on such partners for fulfillment of customer demand 
this program may not yield the efficiencies that we expect  which would negatively impact our financial performance 
any disruptions to on time delivery to customers would adversely impact our business and revenues 
furthermore  because we have outsourced significant manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers and have exited a number of businesses  we now have excess manufacturing capacity in existing facilities 
we are currently restructuring our operations and implementing cost reduction activities to eliminate this excess capacity  including the consolidation of our real estate portfolio and facilities associated with our former manufacturing operations in marlborough and santa clara 
we sold our singapore manufacturing facility and have leased back space for our asia pacific region distribution center and office location for sales management  information technology  training and customer service and support operations in fiscal  and we sold our manufacturing facility in mount prospect in july our ability to reduce our excess manufacturing capacity and to consolidate facilities may be made more difficult by further weakening of the networking industry and worsening of general economic conditions in the united states and globally 
if we are unable to reduce our excess manufacturing capacity and facilities  this may negatively impact our operations  cost structure and financial performance 
demand forecasting  increased contract manufacturing  delivery and logistics disruptions and historical component shortages continue to pose major supply chain risks current business conditions and operational challenges in managing our supply chain affect our business in a number of ways certain key components  in the recent past  have had limited availability  there are a smaller number of suppliers and we have narrowed our supplier base  including in some cases the sole sourcing of certain components from a single supplier  as siliconization of networking features continues  we are increasingly facing competition from parties who have traditionally been and are currently our suppliers  our ability to accurately forecast demand is diminished  especially in light of general economic weakness and uncertainty following the terrorist events in the last year and continually deteriorating conditions in the telecommunications industry  our significantly increased reliance on and long term arrangements with third party manufacturers places much of the supply chain process out of our direct control and heightens the need for accurate forecasting and reduces our ability to transition quickly to alternative supply chain strategies  and our present manufacturing capacities exceed our current needs 
some key components of our products and some services that we rely on are currently available only from single or limited sources 
in addition  some of our suppliers are also our competitors 
we cannot be certain that in the future our suppliers  particularly those who are also in active competition with us  will be able or willing to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
increasingly  we have been sourcing a greater number of components from a smaller number of vendors 
also  there has recently been a trend toward consolidation of vendors of electronic components 
this greater reliance on a smaller number of suppliers and the inability to quickly switch vendors increase the risk of logistics disruptions  unfavorable price fluctuations or disruptions in supply  particularly in a supply constrained environment 
operation of the supply chain requires accurate forecasting of demand  which has become more challenging due to weak industry conditions  emerging technologies  logistics disruptions and developing markets 
if overall demand for our products  product mix and growth of these markets is significantly different from our forecasting and planning  we may face inadequate  or excess  component supply 
this would result in orders for products that could not be manufactured in a timely manner  or a buildup of inventory that could not easily be sold 
either of these situations could adversely affect our revenues  financial results or market share 
if our demand forecasts are too high or our forecasts of product mix are inaccurate  we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and excess manufacturing capacity  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our current and future decisions to exit certain product lines may have unforeseen negative impacts to our business in fiscal and early fiscal  we exited certain business and product lines  including the cable modem business 
in certain cases  we continue to be responsible pursuant to the original warranty obligations for these products 
our exiting of these business and product lines may have adversely impacted our relationships with channel partners and end customers since many of these channel partners and customers perceived our remaining products as not being part of a larger integrated or complementary solution or questioned our commitment to their markets and therefore shifted to products from alternative vendors 
we may consider exiting other businesses that do not meet our goal of delivering appropriate financial returns in a reasonable amount of time 
our decision to exit future businesses could result in deterioration of our channel partner and customer relationships  increased employee costs such as severance  outplacement and other benefits  contract termination costs and asset impairments 
we may also experience delays in the execution of our plan to exit a business that may create disruptions in our transactions with suppliers and customers 
the reduced role of acquisitions in our current business strategy may negatively impact our growth and increase our reliance on strategic relationships we expect that the number of acquisitions of businesses or product lines will decrease in comparison to historical levels 
the networking business is highly competitive and our failure to pursue future acquisitions could hamper our ability to enhance existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
future consolidations in the networking industry may result in new companies with greater resources and stronger competitive positions and products than us 
furthermore  companies may be created that are able to respond more rapidly to market opportunities 
continued consolidation in our industry may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
we will continue to pursue strategic relationships to complement internal development of new technologies and enhancement of existing products and to exploit market potentials 
these strategic relationships can present additional problems since  in most cases  we must compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances and  at the same time  cooperate with the same companies in other business areas 
if these companies fail to perform  or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product or market development or other operational difficulties 
furthermore  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we experience difficulties managing relationships with our partners or if projects with partners are unsuccessful 
in addition  if our strategic partners are acquired by third parties or if our competitors enter into successful strategic relationships  we may face increased competition 
certain of our international markets are risky and may negatively impact our operating results we operate internationally and expect that international markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales 
the recent global economic slowdown has already had and is likely to continue to have a negative effect on various international markets in which we operate 
this may cause us to simplify our international legal entity structure and reduce our presence in certain countries  which may negatively affect the overall level of business in such countries 
recent political and social turmoil may likely further exacerbate existing economic and political instability and currency fluctuations in certain international markets in which we participate  and such conditions can adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
unforeseen conditions and events will positively or negatively impact the level of international sales or our international operations in different regions 
for example  the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other countries currencies could make our products more expensive than locally manufactured products  thereby negatively impacting demand for our products 
also  our contract manufacturers manufacture many of our products overseas  sometimes in politically or economically unstable countries 
should international regions experience economic or political instability  our results of operations may be adversely affected  our ability to forecast demand for our products may also be impacted and our supply of products may be interrupted 
our reliance on industry standards  a favorable regulatory environment  technological change in the marketplace and new product initiatives may cause our revenues to fluctuate or decline the networking industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer requirements  evolving industry standards and complex government regulation 
as a result  our success depends on the emergence of new technology or the convergence of technologies such as voice and data networking or ip telephony  our ability to develop new products to address changes in technologies and related customer requirements on a timely basis  the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards  and a favorable regulatory environment 
slow market acceptance of new technologies  products or industry standards could adversely affect our revenues or overall financial performance 
in addition  if our technology is not included in an industry standard on a timely basis or if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our revenues from sales of such products or our overall financial performance could be adversely affected 
the telecommunications industry  in particular  is subject to complex government regulation  including regulations defined by the us federal government  its agencies such as the federal communications commission  state public service commissions and various governmental authorities in foreign countries 
failure to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for our products or to comply with all applicable government regulations could adversely impact our revenues or overall financial performance or expose us to fines or other penalties 
in addition  new or revised government regulations could adversely affect the basic business economics for new technologies or their rates of acceptance or adoption by potential customers  in turn  this could adversely impact our revenues or overall financial performance 
our customer order fulfillment capabilities fluctuate and may negatively impact our operating results the timing and amount of our sales depend on a number of factors that make estimating operating results uncertain 
throughout our business  we do not typically maintain a significant backlog and sales are partially dependent on our ability to appropriately forecast product demand 
in addition  our customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short period  resulting in limited visibility to sales trends and potential pricing pressures 
consequently  our operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders and our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner 
historically  sales in the third month of the quarter have been higher than sales in each of the first two months of the quarter 
non linear sales patterns make business planning difficult  and increase the risk that our quarterly results will fluctuate due to disruptions in functions such as manufacturing  order management  information systems  and shipping 
we may not always be able to adequately protect or maintain our intellectual property rights many of our competitors  such as telecommunications  networking and computer equipment manufacturers  have large intellectual property portfolios  including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
in addition  many smaller companies  universities  and individual inventors have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business 
the industry is moving towards aggressive assertion  licensing  and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies  protocols  or specifications in our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale  and use of our products  particularly those that must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  the existence of or any adverse determinations in this litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
in addition  if we are the alleged infringer  we could be required to seek licenses from others or be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which could cause disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete 
if we are asserting our intellectual property rights  we could be prevented from stopping others from manufacturing or selling competitive products 
any one of these factors could adversely affect our product margins  results of operations or financial condition 
our future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly 
in addition to factors discussed above  activities relating to the restructuring of our bcc and bnc businesses and the change in leadership for our commworks business could contribute significantly to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results for the next several quarters 
historically  our stock price has experienced substantial price volatility 
we expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future  due to a variety of potential factors such as fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  depletion of our cash balances  variations between our actual financial results and the published analysts expectations and announcements by our competitors 
in addition  over the past several quarters  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock prices of many technology companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions or investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial statements and the accounting profession  may have a material adverse affect on the market price of our stock in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income securities with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at may  and june   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability and intention to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
if necessary  we may sell short term investments prior to maturity to meet the liquidity needs of the company 
we had a portfolio of fixed and floating rate debt of approximately million as of may  and million as of june  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value or cash flows associated with this debt 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from may  and june  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from may  and june  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had an immaterial impact on the value of these securities held at may  equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had a million impact on the value of these securities held at june
