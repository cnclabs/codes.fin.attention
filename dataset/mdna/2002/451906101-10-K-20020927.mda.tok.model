critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates 
table of contents that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  warranty costs  revenue recognition as well as loss contingencies and restructurings 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in returns and information obtained directly from the customers regarding possible returns 
if the actual future returns do not reflect the historical data  our revenue could be affected 
goodwill impairments we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the impairment test entails comparing the carrying value of goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit that the goodwill is assigned 
there are a number of significant management assumptions and estimates inherent in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit including those used to estimate future cash flows and the appropriate rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the cash flows 
actual cash flows may be less than those estimated by management 
a change in industry or market conditions could result in the impairment of goodwill 
inventory allowances inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions as well as the anticipated timing and impact of new product introductions 
actual demand  market conditions and timing of new product introductions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our gross margins and operating results 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor usage costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
the company must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
certain of the company s imaging segment equipment sales such as its touchprint live scan systems generally require installation subsequent to shipment and transfer of title 
the company recognizes revenue on such sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  product revenue related to equipment sales that require installation is deferred until installation is complete and customer acceptance has been obtained 
revenue related to product sales that require no installation such as printers and other peripheral devices as well as the company s security segment products including dfr  
table of contents dfr and fingerscan v are recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  generally upon shipment by the company  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is deemed reasonably assured 
revenues from sales of products via authorized representatives  dealers  distributors or other third party sales channels are recognized at the time the risks and rewards have transferred or  in the case of touchprint live scan systems that generally require installation  upon the final installation and acceptance from the end user 
the company also sells several stand alone software products including biologon and software developer kits 
revenue is recognized on software products in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company recognizes revenue on software products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement and collection is determined to be probable 
vsoe is established based upon either sales of the element eg maintenance  training or consulting in individual transactions  or  in certain cases for maintenance  based upon substantive renewal rates 
in cases where the company does not have vsoe for all delivered elements in the transaction eg  for licenses  the fees from these multiple element agreements are allocated using the residual value method 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized rateably over the life of the service period of the related agreement 
the majority of the company s services are performed for the us government under various firm fixed price ffp  time and material t m and cost reimbursement contracts 
revenues on ffp contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
revenues on t m contracts are recognized to the extent of billable rates multiplied by hours worked plus materials expense incurred 
revenues for cost plus fixed fee cpff contracts are recognized as costs are incurred  including a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue accrued which becomes billable per the terms of contract 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recorded in the period such losses are determined 
services revenues directly from contracts with the us government  principally with the department of defense dod  and from subcontracts with other us government contractors  were approximately and of total services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
contract costs for services revenues to the us government  including indirect expenses  are subject to audit and subsequent adjustment by negotiation between the company and us government representatives 
revenues are recorded in amounts expected to be realized upon final settlement 
ips is currently being audited by the defense contract audit agency for the period from july  to june  while the company believes that the results of such audit will have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  there can be no assurance that no adjustment will be made and that  if made  such adjustments will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
loss contingencies and restructurings we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such reserves should be adjusted 
we recorded reserves for the estimated cost to terminate or sublease excess facilities 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions quarterly to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
if we determine that our estimates for sublease activities has significantly changed  an adjustment to the restructuring liability would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made
