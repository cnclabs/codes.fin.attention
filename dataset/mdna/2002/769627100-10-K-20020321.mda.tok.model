liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and short term investments of million at december   which was a decrease of million from  which represents approximately the net reduction of long term debt 
cash balances include amounts that may be required to fund the chairman s pension obligation in a rabbi trust with days notice 
see note to the financial statements  other long term liabilities 
although there is no current intention to require this funding  under certain circumstances  approximately million could be disbursed in a short period 
in addition  the las vegas operations are self insured for workmen s compensation claims 
the state of nevada requires that riviera holdings corporation maintain a million tangible net worth  as defined in the statute 
if tangible net worth were to fall below million  the company would have to fund a million bond with the state or obtain workmen s compensation insurance at a significantly higher rate 
the aggregate potential cash usage for these two items could approach million  which would reduce the amounts available for other corporate purposes 
for  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in net cash used in financing was million in and million in  primarily due to the repurchase of treasury stock and black hawk first mortgage notes 
ebitda  as defined  for and was million and million  respectively 
management believes that cash flow from operations  combined with the million cash and short term investments  will be sufficient to cover the company s debt service and enable investment in budgeted capital expenditures of million for the next twelve months 
cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the million notes at maturity on august  and the million notes at maturity on may  accordingly  the ability of the company and its subsidiary to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon its ability to refinance those notes 
there can be no assurance that the company and its subsidiary will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity 
the notes were redeemable at the option of the company beginning august   at premiums beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in riviera black hawk  inc notes are redeemable beginning may  at premiums beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in the and note indentures provide that  in certain circumstances  the company and its subsidiary must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company and its subsidiary would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries and its unrestricted subsidiary riviera black hawk  inc under the notes indenture  subject to certain exceptions  to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  iii enter into certain transactions with affiliates  iv create certain liens  sell certain assets  and v enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  the company and its subsidiaries would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs under these circumstances  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
at december   the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants 
in march  the assets of black hawk became secondary collateral for the notes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total and thereafter contractual obligations long term debt      operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations      other long term obligations consist primarily of maintenance contracts  which extend for more than one year on equipment such as signage  elevators  copiers  etc 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to adopt accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
management periodically evaluates its policies  estimates and assumptions related to  these policies 
the company operates in a highly regulated industry 
for both our las vegas  nevada and black hawk  colorado operations we are subject to regulations that describe and regulate operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips and tokens  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
future actual results will likely differ from these estimates 
the company has determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements long lived assets the company has a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
the company estimates that the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceeds the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these undiscounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect operating results 
the company estimates useful lives for its assets based on historical experience  estimates of assets commercial lives  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  the company would record an impairment charge 
the company reviews useful lives  obsolescence  and assesses commercial viability of these assets periodically 
we utilize estimates related to cash flow projections related to the application of sfas for the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
these estimates are made using assumptions about the economic  social and regulatory environments in which we operate 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by numerous unforeseen events including changes to regulations affecting how we operate our business  changes in the labor market or economic downturns in the areas where we operate 
provision for credit losses the company maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and the company s operating results
