item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general for fiscal year ended june   the company s results include the operations of amplicon  calfirst leasing  and calfirst bank 
for the fiscal years ended june  and before  the company s only active subsidiary was amplicon  and the results for such years are almost exclusively related to amplicon s operations 
the company s direct finance income includes interest income earned on the company s investment in lease receivables and residuals 
other income primarily includes gains realized on the sale of leased property  income from sales type and operating leases and gains realized on the sale of leases  and other fee income 
income from sales type leases relates to the re lease of off lease property lease extensions and new lease transactions that qualify as sales type leases  generally where the fair value of the property subject to the lease differs from the company s carrying cost 
income from operating leases generally involves the short term rental of leased property 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including the volume of new lease originations  the volume and profitability of leased property being re marketed through re lease or sale  variations in the mix of lease originations  the size and credit quality of the lease portfolio  interest rates and economic conditions in general 
the company has very little interest bearing liabilities  and therefore  reductions in interest rates in general can reduce the yield earned on the investment in lease receivables and on the investment in securities and other interest earning assets 
calfirst bank incurred losses during the year ended june  and it is anticipated that calfirst bank will continue to be unprofitable during fiscal the company conducts its leasing business in a manner designed to minimize risks 
however  the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing industry and the company is subject to risks through its investment in lease receivables held in its own portfolio  lease transactions in process  and residual investments 
the company takes steps to mitigate risks through the implementation of strict credit management processes and on going risk management review procedures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates that impact the stated amount of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based on management s judgment and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from current judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
the following is a description of the most critical accounting policies management applies  all of which require the use of accounting estimates and management s judgment  based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
residual values for capital leases that qualify as direct financing leases  the aggregate lease payments receivable and estimated residual value  if any  are recorded on the balance sheet  net of unearned income  as net investment in capital leases 
of the capital leases booked during the fiscal year ended june   approximately were structured as true leases  where the company owns the leased asset at the end of the term and therefore  the company recorded a residual value 
the residual value is an estimate for accounting purposes of the fair value of the leased property at lease termination and is determined at the inception of the lease based on the property leased and the terms and conditions of the underlying lease contract 
the realizability of any estimated residual value depends on future collateral values  contractual options available to the lessee  the credit of the lessee  market conditions and other subjective and qualitative factors 
the estimated residual values established at lease inception are periodically reviewed to determine if values are reasonably realizable and any identified losses are recognized through an addition to the allowance for valuation of residual values or through a write off of such amount 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimatable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio  including levels of non performing leases  lessees financial condition  leased property values as well as general economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
the company s allowance includes an estimate of reserves needed to cover specifically identified lease losses and certain unidentified but inherent risks in the portfolio 
the company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts the company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts 
consolidated statement of earnings analysis summary for fiscal year ended june   net earnings decreased to million  compared to million for fiscal and million in diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal year ended june   compared to per share for fiscal and per share in the volume of new lease transactions booked during the year ended june  was approximately million  compared to million in fiscal and million during fiscal the company s new origination volume declined over the past two years due in part to soft economic conditions 
the lower volume of lease originations has limited growth in the investment in capital leases  and impacted the growth in direct finance income 
the significant reduction in interest rate levels over the past eighteen months has also impacted the level of direct finance and interest income 
finally  the adverse credit and economic environment impacted the company s lease portfolio over the period  and resulted in a significant provision for lease losses during fiscal net direct finance and interest income net direct finance and interest income is the difference between interest earned on the investment in capital leases  securities and other interest earning investments and interest paid on deposits or other borrowings 
the company incurred no interest expense until the year ended june   when interest expense was still immaterial as deposits raised by the bank were insignificant 
net direct finance and interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets  the movement of interest rates  and funding and pricing strategies 
net direct finance and interest income was million for fiscal year ended june  compared to million for fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was a due to a decline of million in interest income on investments  offset by a  increase in direct finance income from capital leases 
the decrease in interest income on investments resulted from the decline in interest rates earned  which was offset by an increase in the average balances of cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in direct finance income reflects an increase in the average investment in capital leases directly held by the company excluding discounted lease rentals  which was offset slightly by lower yields on such investment 
the increase in net direct finance and interest income in the year ended june  is attributable to a million increase in direct finance income  reflecting the benefit from the larger lease portfolio held by the company 
this increase was offset by a  decrease in interest income on investments resulting from lower cash and cash equivalent balances  which outweighed an increase in interest rates

average balance is based on quarter end balances  and includes non accrual leases  and is presented net of unearned income 
provision for lease losses the company s provision for lease losses in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in the million increase in fiscal was due in large part to the deterioration in the underlying credit of two large lease transactions 
in addition  the increase in and reflects the growth in the investment in capital leases and a general increase in the level of delinquencies and charge offs in the portfolio 
other income other income is a significant source of income for the company  accounting for of the company s gross profit during the year ended june   during fiscal and during total other income for the year ended june  decreased by  or  to million  compared to million for and million in the decrease in other income during fiscal reflects a million  or  decrease in operating and sales type lease income due to a lower volume of lease extensions 
the decrease in operating and sales type lease income was offset by a million  or  increase in the gain on sale of leases and leased property which resulted from better realization of values on leased property sold 
during the year ended june   other income decreased by million  or 
the decrease included a million  or  decrease in income from the sale of leases and leased property  and a million  or  decrease in income from operating and sales type leases 
the decline in gain on sale of leases and leased property was the result of a lower volume of lease transactions coming to end of term during fiscal where the leased property was sold to the lessee or a third party  and lower income from the sale of leases as the company retained more leases in its own portfolio 
the decline in operating and sales type lease income resulted from a reduction in income from new lease transactions structured as sales type leases and a reduction in income from lease extensions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  to million during the year ended june  this compared to sg a expenses in fiscal of million  which had increased by million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses during fiscal is primarily the result of steps taken to reduce sales and overhead expenses during a period of economic uncertainty 
this increase in sg a expenses during fiscal was the result of higher salary and benefit expenses incurred during the first nine months of the fiscal year and the impact of accruals related to legal and personnel matters taken in fiscal income taxes income taxes were accrued at a tax rate of for each of the fiscal years ended june   and  representing the company s estimated annual tax rates for each respective year 
financial condition analysis lease portfolio analysis the company retains leases in its own portfolio that are not assigned to financial institutions 
over the past two fiscal years  the company has funded a significantly greater percentage of new lease transactions internally 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of the total dollar amount of new leases booked by the company were held in its own portfolio  compared to during fiscal and during during the fiscal year ended june   the company s net investment in capital leases decreased by million 
this decrease includes a  decrease in the company s investment in lease receivables  and a million reduction in the investment in estimated residual values 
the decrease in the investment in capital leases is primarily due to the lower volume of new lease transactions booked as compared to the volume of lease transactions coming to their end of term during the year 
the company often makes payments to purchase leased property prior to the commencement of the lease 
the disbursements for these lease transactions in process are generally made to facilitate the lessees property implementation schedule 
the lessee is contractually obligated by the lease to make rental payments directly to the company during the period that the transaction is in process  and the lessee is generally obligated to reimburse the company for all disbursements under certain circumstances 
at june   the company s investment in property acquired for transactions in process was million  relatively unchanged from million at june   but down from million at june  this decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of lease transactions in process during fiscal and the company s risk assets are comprised almost exclusively of leases for capital assets to businesses and other commercial or non profit organizations 
all leases are secured by the underlying property being leased 
the company s strategy is to develop lease portfolios with risk reward profiles that meet its objectives 
through the use of nonrecourse financing  the company avoids risks that do not meet these requirements 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on both a geographic and customer level  and spreading the company s risk across a breadth of leases while minimizing the risk to any one area 
at june   no lessee accounted for more than of the company s net investment in capital leases  and only one lessee represented more than of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the investment in capital leases is diversified by geographic regions  with the company s portfolio spread across all fifty states 
at june   california at and new york were the only states that represented more than of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company has no exposure to foreign lessees 
the company s leases are with lessees in a wide spectrum of industries  however  at june   approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases was with colleges and universities located throughout the united states 
the college and university portfolio includes over leases with over different lessees  and no leases are included among the company s non performing or other problem leases 
only one university represented over of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company monitors the performance of all leases held in its own portfolio  transactions in process as well as lease transactions assigned to lenders  if the company retains a residual investment in the leased property subject to the lease 
an ongoing review of all leases or more days delinquent is conducted 
lessees who are delinquent with the company or an assignee are coded in the company s accounting and tracking systems in order to provide management visibility  periodic reporting  and appropriate reserves 
the accrual of interest income on leases will generally be discontinued when the lease becomes days or more past due on its lease payments with the company  unless the company believes the investment is otherwise recoverable 
leases may be placed on non accrual earlier if the company has significant doubt about the ability of the lessee to meet its lease obligations  as evidenced by consistent delinquency  deterioration in the lessee s financial condition or other relevant factors 
the following table summarizes the company s non performing capital leases at june  non performing capital leases non accrual leases restructured leases leases past due days other than above total non performing capital leases non performing assets as of total investment in capital leases direct finance income that would have been recorded had non performing leases been current in accordance with their original terms would have been  during fiscal and none in the amount of direct finance income actually recorded on non performing capital leases was  and  during and  respectively 
in addition to the non performing capital leases identified above  there were million of investment in capital leases at june  for which management has concerns regarding the ability of the lessees to continue to meet existing lease obligations  compared with million at june  this amount consists of leases classified as substandard or doubtful  or with lessees that currently are experiencing financial difficulties or that management believes may experience financial difficulties in the future 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
lease receivables or residuals are charged off when they are deemed completely uncollectible 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio 
dollars in thousands years ended june  net investment in capital leases at year end allowance for lease losses at beginning of year charge off of lease receivables recovery of amounts previously written off provision for lease losses allowance for lease losses at end of year allowance for lease losses as percent of net investment in capital leases the allowance for lease losses increased to million of net investment in capital leases at june  from million of net investment in capital leases at june  this allowance consisted of million allocated to specific accounts and million that was unallocated 
the increase in the allowance directly relates to specific non performing or problem leases  including two large lease transactions  and also reflects management s assessment of the increased risk of loss in the portfolio in light of the weaker economy and the company s commitment to holding a higher percentage of all lease originations 
the company considers the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at june  adequate to cover losses specifically identified as well as inherent in the lease portfolios 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain lease losses that are sizeable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and the on going credit review process will not require significant increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss even further 
as the company has retained a significantly greater percentage of leases in its own portfolio  this creates increased exposure to delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures and losses than the company has historically experienced 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through internally generated funds  nonrecourse debt and bank deposits 
the leasing companies capital expenditures for leased property purchases are often financed by assigning certain base lease term payments to banks or other financial institutions  including calfirst bank 
the assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
at june   the company had outstanding nonrecourse debt aggregating million relating to property under capital leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate nonrecourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future 
deposits have not been an important source of funds for the company 
deposits totaled million at june   compared to  at june  the following table presents average balances and average rates paid on deposits for years ended june  and years ended june  average average average average balance rate paid balance rate paid non interest bearing demand deposits n a n a interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits less than  time deposits   or more n a n a in april  the board of directors authorized management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to  shares of common stock 
during the year ended june   the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of september    shares remain available under this authorization 
at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents were million 
the need for cash used for operating activities will increase as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  and assignments on a nonrecourse basis of lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
stockholders equity at june  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at june  at june   the company and the bank exceed their regulatory capital requirements and are considered well capitalized under guidelines established by the frb and the occ 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk related to interest rate risk is currently not material because it does not have any interest bearing recourse debt  and at june  the bank s deposits were not material 
nonrecourse debt does not represent any interest rate risk to the company because it is fully amortized through direct payments from lessees to the purchaser of the lease receivable 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its cash investments  because as interest rates decrease  interest income will decrease  and future lease rates from direct financing leases  which often are based on united states treasury rates  may be lower 
the only other interest rate risk the company currently faces relates to the bank s investment in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
this investment matures in less than ninety days and therefore the fair value approximates the carrying value 
the interest rate on this investment was at june  as the banking operations of the company grow  the company will be subject to increased interest rate risk 
the bank has an asset liability management committee and policies established for managing its interest rate risk
