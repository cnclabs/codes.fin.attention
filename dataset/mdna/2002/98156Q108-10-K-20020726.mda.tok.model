item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
background we are an integrated media and entertainment company principally engaged in the development  production and marketing of television programming  pay per view programming and live events  and the licensing and sale of branded consumer products featuring our highly successful brand 
over the past year  we believe that the audience for sports entertainment has contracted and or moved to other forms of entertainment 
as a result  a number of competitors within this industry are no longer operating 
for fiscal  we experienced a softening in the key drivers of our business television ratings  average attendance at our live events and pay per view buys 
nevertheless we have retained our distinction as consistently being the regularly scheduled program on cable with raw which airs monday nights on tnn  and we are the highest rated show on network television on thursday nights among male teens with our upn program  smackdown 
as the industry contracted  we were able to sign additional performers  thus deepening our talent pool 
at the same time  we have broadened our story lines 
as a result  we created two separate brands under the wwe umbrella raw and smackdown 
through our separate branded tours  we now deliver two unique story lines with two distinct groups of talent to our fans around the world 
we now have two live event tours and as a result  have increased the number of live events and are playing markets that heretofore we could not visit given the size of our talent pool and logistical constraints on our television shoots 
we plan to further develop our international business 
the creation of two brands  each with its own tour  has enabled us to tour more internationally 
since we have a television presence in over countries worldwide  we already have a base from which we can embark on live event touring 
in early march  we completed an international live event tour beginning in tokyo and followed by events in singapore and malaysia  all of which events were sold out 
to complement our existing international pay per views  in may we had a live event tour in europe 
in addition  in august we will have a live event in australia and we expect to return to europe for another tour in october we believe that the launch of our international tour and the increased awareness in the local marketplace of wwe product will enable us to expand our branded merchandise offerings 
our operations are organized around two principal activities live and televised entertainment  which consists of live events  television programming and pay per view programming 
revenues consist principally of attendance at live events  sale of television advertising time and sponsorships  domestic and international television rights fees and pay per view buys
