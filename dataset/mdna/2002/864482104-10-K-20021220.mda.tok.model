item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the partnership  which should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
since the operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of the assets  revenues and earnings of the partnership  a separate discussion of the partnership s results of operations from other sources is not presented 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of relating to the partnership s future business expectations and predictions and financial condition and results of operations 
some of these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as prospects  outlook  believes  estimates  intends  may  will  should  anticipates  expects or plans or the negative or other variation of these or similar words  or by discussion or trends and conditions  strategies or risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied in such forward looking statements cautionary statements 
the risks and uncertainties and their impact on the partnership s operations include  but are not limited to  the following risks o the impact of weather conditions on the demand for propane  o fluctuations in the unit cost of propane  o the ability of the partnership to compete with other suppliers of propane and other energy sources  o the impact on propane prices and supply of the political and economic instability of the oil producing nations and other general economic conditions  o the ability of the partnership to retain customers  o the impact of energy efficiency and technology advances on the demand for propane  o the ability of management to continue to control expenses  o the impact of regulatory developments on the partnership s business  o the impact of legal proceedings on the partnership s business  o the partnership s ability to implement its expansion strategy into new business lines and sectors  o the partnership s ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
some of these forward looking statements are discussed in more detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report 
on different occasions  the partnership or its representatives have made or may make forward looking statements in other filings that the partnership makes with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of its authorized executive officers 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking or cautionary statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
the partnership undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking or cautionary statement 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this annual report and in future sec reports 
the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition product costs the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
the average cost of propane to the partnership was substantially less throughout the majority of fiscal compared to both fiscal and the average cost of propane for fiscal was approximately below fiscal levels  which were approximately above fiscal therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september the partnership s third and fourth fiscal quarters are expected 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many customers of the partnership rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the partnership s service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
risk management product supply contracts are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted market prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce profit margins 
the partnership engages in risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on its product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
the partnership is currently a party to propane futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange and enters into forward and option agreements with third parties to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
risk management activities are monitored by management through enforcement of the partnership s commodity trading policy and reported to the partnership s audit committee 
risk management transactions do not always result in increased product margins 
see additional discussion in item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefits  self insurance and legal reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessment and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of propane at the time product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete  as applicable 
revenue from repair and maintenance activities is recognized upon completion of the service 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
for a discussion of the impact of recent conditions in the capital markets on our pension plan assets see pension plan assets below 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim or the amount of the deductible  whichever is lower  utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for additional information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to million in fiscal this decrease is principally due to a decrease in average selling prices  coupled with a decrease in retail gallons sold 
average selling prices declined as a result of a significant decline in the commodity price of propane in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease in volume was attributable to record warm weather conditions which were most dramatic during the peak heating months of october through march of fiscal as well as  to a lesser extent  the impact of the economic recession on commercial and industrial customers buying habits 
retail gallons sold decreased  or million gallons  to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal nationwide temperatures during fiscal were warmer than normal as compared to temperatures that were colder than normal during fiscal  as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 
during the peak heating months of october through march  temperatures nationwide were warmer than normal as compared to colder than normal in the comparable period in fiscal  as reported by noaa 
volumes from the components of our customer mix that are less weather sensitive declined approximately year over year 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal a less volatile commodity price environment for propane during fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in reduced risk management activities and lower volumes in the wholesale market 
revenue from other sources  including sales of appliances and related parts and services  of million in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal revenues of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating expenses for the year ended september  include a million unrealized gain representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments not designated as hedges  compared to a million unrealized loss in fiscal see item a of this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
excluding the impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments on both the current and prior year results  operating expenses decreased million  or  principally attributable to our ability to reduce costs amidst declining volumes resulting from ongoing initiatives to shift costs from fixed to variable  primarily in the areas of employee compensation and benefits 
the lower compensation costs were offset  in part  by an increase in medical and dental costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
additionally  operating expenses were favorably impacted by lower provisions for doubtful accounts and lower costs of operating our fleet  including maintenance and fuel costs  in fiscal compared to fiscal provisions for doubtful accounts were higher in fiscal primarily from the generally higher selling price environment driven by the higher average propane costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  again attributable to lower employee compensation and benefit costs  as well as to lower fees for professional services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year primarily as a result of our decision to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective september  the beginning of fiscal  which eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
if sfas had been in effect at the beginning of the prior year  fiscal net income would have improved by million 
refer to adoption of new accounting standard below for further information on the adoption of sfas gain on sale of storage facility 
on january   we sold our million gallon propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi  which was considered a non strategic asset  for net cash proceeds of million  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately million 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
income before interest expense and income taxes decreased  or million  to million compared to million in the prior year 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decreases in income before interest expense and income taxes and in ebitda reflect the impact of the lower retail volumes sold in fiscal attributable to unseasonably warm heating season temperatures and the economy  partially offset by i the million  or  decrease in combined operating and general and administrative expenses described above  ii the impact of the million gain on the sale of our hattiesburg  mississippi storage facility and iii the impact on operating expenses of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments described above 
in addition  if sfas had been in effect at the beginning of the prior year  fiscal income before interest expense and income taxes would have improved by million 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not in accordance with or superior to generally accepted accounting principles but provides additional information for evaluating our ability to distribute our quarterly distributions or to increase distributions 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and this measure may vary among companies  the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda is calculated using elements derived from captions on the consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report 
see item in this annual report for a reconciliation of ebitda to income before interest expense and provision for income taxes 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in average amounts outstanding during fiscal under our revolving credit agreement  as well as lower average interest rates 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year results for fiscal reflect weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal results for fiscal include a million gain on sale of assets 
revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail propane activities increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher product costs which resulted in higher retail sales prices 
retail gallons sold increased slightly to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal this increase is attributable to colder weather offset by customer conservation efforts 
nationwide temperatures during fiscal were colder than normal as compared to temperatures that were warmer than normal during fiscal  as reported by the noaa 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal although propane product costs were substantially higher in fiscal than in prior years  product costs began to decline in the second half of fiscal accordingly  the partnership reduced its risk management activities resulting in a decrease in revenues from the risk management sale of propane 
revenue from other sources  including sales of appliances  related parts and services of million in fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal revenues of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is principally attributable to increased payroll and benefit costs  including increased incentive compensation accruals in line with higher earnings  higher provisions for doubtful accounts resulting from the increases in selling prices  higher insurance  increased vehicle fuel costs  the development of retail and service business initiatives and unrealized losses recorded under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  related to changes in fair values of the partnership s derivative instruments 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher payroll and benefit costs  including incentive compensation accruals in line with higher earnings  increased costs for professional services and higher equipment leasing costs  offset in part by gains realized on the sales of non strategic assets and corporate investments in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gain on sale of assets 
results for fiscal reflect a gain of million associated with the sale of customer service centers principally located in georgia in december total cash proceeds in connection with the sale amounted to approximately million 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
results for fiscal include a million gain on the sale of assets 
excluding this one time item  income before interest expense and income taxes increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior period 
ebitda  excluding the one time item  increased  or million  to million compared to million in the prior period 
the increases in income before interest expense and income taxes and in ebitda are primarily attributable to higher gross profit of million reflecting higher retail margins  partially offset by increased operating and general and administrative expenses 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not in accordance with or superior to generally accepted accounting principles but provides additional information for evaluating our ability to distribute our quarterly distributions 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and this measure may vary among companies  the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda is calculated using elements derived from captions on the consolidated statement of operations included in this annual report on form k 
see item in this annual report for a reconciliation of ebitda to income before interest expense and provision for income taxes 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or million  to million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to reductions in amounts outstanding under the partnership s revolving credit agreement and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources due to the seasonal nature of the propane business  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons  our second and third fiscal quarters  as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower net income  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods principally depreciation  amortization and gains on asset disposals  as well as the impact of unfavorable changes in working capital in comparison to the prior year  principally reflecting lower compensation and benefit accruals  offset by lower inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to improved working capital principally reflected in decreased accounts receivable  attributable to a decrease in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal  decreased accounts payable  attributable to the decreased cost of propane during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and higher net income  after adjusting for non cash items depreciation  amortization and gains on disposal of assets in both periods 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets including net proceeds of million resulting from the sale of our propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations and million of acquisition payments  including million for the acquisition of certain assets from scana corporation in november the scana acquisition  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment  including customer service centers 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  primarily reflecting the payment of quarterly distributions to our common unitholders and the general partner 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting repayments under the operating partnership s revolving credit agreement  as amended and restated effective january  the revolving credit agreement  including a net repayment of million borrowed under the scana acquisition facility and a net repayment of million borrowed under the net working capital facility  and million in partnership distributions  partly offset by net proceeds of million from a public offering of  common units in october net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting million in borrowings to fund the scana acquisition and million of net working capital borrowings under the revolving credit agreement offset by million in partnership distributions and million of expenses to amend the revolving credit agreement 
the increase of million in partnership distributions during fiscal is attributable to the increase in common units outstanding as a result of the public offering and the increases in the quarterly distribution amounts 
on march   pursuant to a senior note agreement the senior note agreement  we issued million of senior notes the senior notes with an annual interest rate of 
our obligations under the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with our obligations under the revolving credit agreement 
under the terms of the senior note agreement  we became obligated to pay the principal on the senior notes in equal annual payments of million starting july   with the last such payment due june  on july   we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes due june  the senior notes and used the funds to pay the first annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement 
our obligations under the agreement governing the senior notes the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with our obligations under the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement 
we intend to refinance the second annual principal payment of million on the senior notes due during fiscal and have initiated discussions with various third parties 
alternatively  we currently expect that we will generate sufficient funds from operations to satisfy the principal payment 
our revolving credit agreement  as amended on january   provides a million working capital facility and a million acquisition facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate based upon either libor plus a margin  wachovia national bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual fee ranging from 
to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
as of september  and september   million was outstanding under the acquisition facility of the revolving credit agreement and there were no borrowings under the working capital facility 
the revolving credit agreement matures on may  and  accordingly  the million outstanding balance has been classified as a current liability at september  we have initiated discussions to extend  or otherwise modify  the revolving credit agreement on a long term basis 
although there can be no assurance  we currently believe that we will be able to extend or otherwise modify the revolving credit agreement on terms economically satisfactory to the partnership 
the senior note agreement  the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership  including a maintenance of certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  a leverage ratio of less than to and an interest coverage ratio in excess of to  b restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and c restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
in addition  the senior note agreement contains an adjusted net worth test which requires that we maintain an adjusted net worth as defined in the senior note agreement in excess of million 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the senior note agreement  the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement as of september  during december  we amended the senior note agreement to i eliminate the adjusted net worth financial test to be consistent with the senior note agreement and revolving credit agreement  and ii add a second tier leverage ratio which will capture the underfunded portion of our pension obligations 
see pension plan assets below 
we will make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the second amended and restated partnership agreement  approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
during each of the first two quarters of fiscal  we made distributions to our common unitholders of per common unit 
on may   the board of supervisors declared a annualized increase in the quarterly distribution from per common unit to per common unit  or on an annualized basis  for the third quarter of fiscal  which was paid on august  on october   the board of supervisors declared a quarterly distribution of per common unit for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was paid on november  to holders of record on november  these quarterly distributions included incentive distribution rights idrs  which are payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per common unit 
the idrs represent an incentive for the general partner which is owned by senior management of the partnership to increase the distributions to common unitholders in excess of the per common unit target level 
with regard to the first of the common unit distribution paid in each quarter  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
with regard to the balance of the common unit distributions paid  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
as discussed above  the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  were adversely impacted by unseasonably warm weather nationwide throughout fiscal and during the peak heating season  in particular  as weather was warmer than normal in fiscal and warmer than the prior year 
our ability to manage our cost structure  coupled with our success in monetizing the hattiesburg  mississippi storage facility during the second quarter of fiscal  which was considered a non strategic asset  helped mitigate some of the negative impact of warmer weather conditions on our results of operations and cash flow 
even with near record warm temperatures nationwide throughout fiscal  we effectively managed our cash flow without the need to utilize our working capital facility under the revolving credit agreement 
our anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million for the repair and replacement of property  plant and equipment  approximately million of interest payments on the senior notes  the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement and a principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement 
in addition  assuming distributions remain at the current level  we will be required to pay approximately million in distributions to common unitholders and the general partner during fiscal based on our current estimate of our cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
pension plan assets as a result of continued turbulent capital markets over the past two years  coupled with the low interest rate environment  the market value of our pension portfolio assets have declined significantly while the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plan has steadily increased 
as a result  the projected benefit obligation as of september  exceeded the market value of pension plan assets by million 
the unrealized losses experienced in the pension assets resulted in the partnership recording a million reduction to accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a component of partners capital  at the end of fiscal in order to adjust our pension liability to reflect the underfunded position 
this pension adjustment  coupled with the million adjustment required at the end of fiscal  results in a cumulative reduction of partners capital in the amount of million on the consolidated balance sheet at september  these required pension adjustments are attributable to the level of unrealized losses experienced on our pension assets over the past two years and represent non cash charges to our partners capital with no impact on the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  while fiscal and results of operations were not affected by the significant unrealized losses in the pension portfolio assets over the past two years  pension expense is expected to increase in fiscal as unrealized losses begin to affect the net periodic pension cost pursuant to sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  unless market conditions generate unrealized gains in our pension assets to offset past unrealized losses 
for purposes of computing the actuarial valuation of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets  we reduced the key valuation assumptions to reflect an estimate of current market expectations related to long term rates of return on assets and interest rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced from as of september  to as of september  and the discount rate assumption was reduced to from 
there were no funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal or in an effort to minimize future increases in the benefit obligations  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted an amendment to the defined benefit pension plan which will cease future service credits effective january  this amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of million included within the net periodic pension cost for the year ended september  there can be no assurances that future declines in capital markets will not have an adverse impact on results of operations or cash flow 
long term debt obligations and other commitments long term debt obligations and future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are due as follows amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total long term debt       operating leases       total long term debt obligations and lease commitments       additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire on march  related party transaction in connection with the partnership s recapitalization in fiscal  the general partner acquired the general partner interests from millennium chemicals inc for million the gp loan which was borrowed under a private placement with mellon bank na mellon 
in connection with the gp loan  the operating partnership entered into an agreement with mellon under which the operating partnership was required and had the right to purchase the note evidencing the gp loan in the event of a default under the gp loan by the general partner 
the operating partnership agreed to maintain sufficient borrowing availability under its available lines of credit to enable it to repurchase the gp note in these circumstances 
if the operating partnership elected or was required to purchase the gp note from mellon  the operating partnership had the right to cause up to all of the common units deposited by management in a trust amounting to  common units to be forfeited and cancelled and to cause all of the related distributions to be forfeited  regardless of the amount paid by the operating partnership to purchase the gp note 
in august  the general partner repaid the remaining balance of the gp loan to mellon and  as a result  all of the arrangements described above terminated 
adoption of new accounting standard effective september   the beginning of our fiscal year  we elected to early adopt the provisions of sfas sfas modifies the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets  including the requirement that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized 
this new standard also requires a transitional impairment review for goodwill  as well as an annual impairment review  to be performed on a reporting unit basis 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  amortization expense for fiscal decreased by million compared to fiscal  as a result of the lack of amortization expense related to goodwill 
aside from this change in accounting for goodwill  no other change in accounting for intangible assets was required as a result of the adoption of sfas based on the nature of our intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  we completed a transitional impairment review and  as the fair values of identified reporting units exceed the respective carrying values  goodwill was not considered impaired as of the date of adoption of sfas nor as of september  recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
accretion expense and depreciation expense related to the liability and capitalized asset retirement costs  respectively  would be recorded in subsequent periods 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact  if any  on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and provides guidance on the measurement and recognition of impairment charges for assets to be held and used  assets to be abandoned and assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this standard are to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on april   the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
however  pursuant to sfas  an entity would not be prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items under certain circumstances 
sfas also makes several other technical corrections to existing pronouncements that may change accounting practice 
sfas is effective for transactions occurring after may  based on the nature of transactions covered by this new standard  the standard did not have an impact on the partnership s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations as of and for the year ended september  the provisions of this standard will be reviewed on an ongoing basis  as applicable 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of this standard will be reviewed by the partnership on an ongoing basis  as applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we were a party to propane forward and option contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange the nymex 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices  as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk the partnership is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
credit risk futures are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
the partnership is subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
the partnership evaluates the financial condition of each counterparty with which it conducts business and establishes credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
prior to march   we determined that our derivative instruments did not qualify as hedges and  as such  the changes in fair values were recorded in income 
beginning with contracts entered into subsequent to march   a portion of the derivative instruments entered into have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings 
fair values for forward contracts and futures are derived from quoted market prices for similar instruments traded on the nymex 
at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets of million 
for the year ended september  operating expenses include unrealized gains of million compared to unrealized losses of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
at september   unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the amount of million were included in oci and are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next months as the hedged transactions occur 
however  due to the volatility of the commodities market  the corresponding value in oci is subject to change prior to its impact on earnings 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporated the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed contract price of open positions as of september  for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices for futures and forward contracts as of september  were derived from the nymex for traded propane futures for each of the future periods 
c 
the market prices determined in b above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate either a reduction in potential future gains or potential losses in future earnings by million and million  as of september  and september   respectively 
the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   our open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
the average posted price of propane on december  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon on september   representing a increase
