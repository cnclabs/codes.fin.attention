item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the market for geophysical services is driven ultimately by commodity prices  which are currently at relatively high levels 
oil prices have been over per barrel recently and have averaged in the high s since march natural gas prices have been similarly high in the us with contract prices in the to mcf range 
the positive commodity price news has been tempered somewhat by uncertainty as to the sustainability of these prices and the continued consolidation in the oil and gas business 
in the fourth quarter of this year  we took a million pretax impairment charge related to of our multi client library surveys  which we have shown separately in our income statement as an operating expense 
as we analyzed our fiscal plans in june and july  it became clear that we are not likely to recover the remaining book value of these surveys  hence the fourth quarter charge 
seven of these are land surveys located in the gulf coast region 
exploration spending has been very low in this region since shortly after we completed these surveys  and we do not anticipate any sales of these surveys in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we have written these surveys completely off of our books  with a net charge of million 
we have one survey in the gulf of mexico that was shot at a cost significantly exceeding its original budget 
as we do not currently forecast enough sales to amortize the remainder of the cost of the survey  we have written it down by million 
this leaves million of cost for this survey  an amount we believe to be the fair value of the survey based on future estimated sales 
in the shetland faroes area of the north sea  we have a large survey that has been troubled by an ongoing territorial dispute 
when the dispute was settled  nine year concessions were awarded to various licensees 
given the length of the license period  we do not foresee significant near term additional licensing of this survey  and we have written it off with a net charge of million 
we also have two small d surveys off africa that were written off with a net charge of million 
overall  we feel that our data library business is fundamentally sound 
our current forecasts show that we should recover the costs of the surveys with remaining value and  except as discussed below for us land surveys  will generate a reasonable margin 
due to the continued uncertainty of us land exploration spending  we will generally report no margin on these surveys until all of their costs are fully amortized 
should the us land business change  we may find it prudent to increase our forecasts and book margin on these surveys while costs remain on the books 
during fiscal  we spent million in legal  accounting and banking fees related to our terminated merger with petroleum geo services pgs  and we paid pgs million to terminate the merger agreement 
the total million was expensed as incurred during the last three quarters of the year and has been shown separately in our income statement as an operating expense 
the total of unusual items for the year  the library impairment and the merger costs  is million pretax  or after tax per share 
we are currently forecasting a relatively stable operating environment for fiscal without industry consolidation  it is our view that the industry s capacity in both the marine and land acquisition businesses will remain greater than demand for at least the next year  and this will limit increases in contract margins 
operating margins on multi client revenue are expected to decline due to more conservative sales estimates  most significantly in our us land business 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal multi client revenues increased due to strong pre funded sales in brazil and the north sea  offset by declines in licenses of us land surveys 
contract revenues decreased due to continued overcapacity and aggressive industry pricing which kept our marine fleet focused on multi client projects 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased by million due to the impairment of multi client surveys and merger costs 
operating income  excluding the unusual charges of million  previously described  increased by 
the largest contributor to the increase was improved contract margins and a favorable revenue mix towards multi client  rather than proprietary  work 
this is reflected in the reduction in cost of services as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to this year 
we also benefited by million from the elimination of goodwill amortization in fiscal  due to a change in accounting rules  and by million of reduced general and administrative costs related to reduced information technology expenses and lower employee bonuses 
we recorded an expense of million related to the doubtful collection of our miller exploration company long term receivable 
last year  we released the million reserve related to this receivable based on miller exploration company s public reporting of their intent and ability to pay amounts owed to us 
partially offsetting these decreases was an additional million  a increase  in research and development expense in fiscal other income expense 
other income expense was reduced from million of income in fiscal to an expense of million in fiscal interest income of million in the prior year was reduced to million in fiscal due to lower cash balances 
foreign exchange losses in argentina and canada added million of net expense 
additionally  a loss on investment in miller exploration company s stock and warrants in contributed million of additional expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a program to liquidate our investment in miller exploration company and recognized the unrealized loss as expense  as we feel that the reduction in value is other than temporary see note 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal due to the tax loss incurred in the effective income tax rate in fiscal  before the unusual charges  was compared to in fiscal the tax benefit related to the million unusual charge was million  for a effective rate  and was less than the statutory rates 
additionally  we recorded a million tax valuation allowance related to net operating losses in argentina  the value of which are not likely to be realized due to our suspension of activity there 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal due to the upturn in exploration spending driven by higher commodity prices 
multi client revenues increased from million to million  while contract revenues increased  from million to million 
contract revenue showed the stronger year to year increase due to our expansion into new market areas  such as alaska  the canadian arctic  offshore canada  and brazil 
operating income 
operating income increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of this million increase was due to the adjustment of receivable reserves 
this adjustment was made  in part  due to our belief in the improved ability of a long term debtor to repay debt 
cost of services decreased to from due to improved equipment utilization 
research and development expense increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to an increase in employees dedicated to research and development 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by due to costs associated with the move to the new houston headquarters building  increased corporate marketing efforts  and higher incentive compensation payments 
other income 
other income increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due partly to an additional million in interest income resulting from the higher cash balances in fiscal in addition  gains on sales of assets of million in fiscal were an improvement of million over the million loss on sales of assets experienced in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due to the increased profitability of the company 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources sources and uses our internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public financing  equity sales  the unutilized portion of a revolving credit facility  equipment financing and trade credit 
we believe that these sources of funds are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for fiscal as of july   we had million in senior notes outstanding due in october these notes contain a change of control provision allowing the holders to require us to call the notes under certain conditions 
there is a possibility we may call these notes before their maturity  and we are allowed to do so at par after october  we are evaluating various external financing alternatives and will use the proceeds of these to retire the senior notes  among other uses 
we may retire the senior notes before their maturity 
we also have a revolving credit facility due august from commercial lenders that provides us advances up to million and us advances up to million 
advances bear interest  at our election  at libor plus a spread or prime rate plus a spread 
these spreads are based on either certain of our financial ratios or our credit rating 
at july  the libor spread was and the prime rate spread was  based upon our current financial ratios 
the maximum libor and prime rate spreads  should our financial ratios deteriorate  are and  respectively 
as of july   there were million of outstanding advances under the credit facility and million of the credit facility was utilized for letters of credit  leaving million available for borrowings 
the following represents our financial contractual obligations and commitments as of july  for the fiscal years through and thereafter and contractual cash obligations total thereafter lease obligations       long term debt   forward exchange contracts    standby letters of credit   we require significant amounts of working capital to support our operations and fund our research and development program 
our capital expenditure for equipment budget in fiscal is approximately million  most of which is designated for replacement and upgrades 
for fiscal  we are planning approximately million of net cash investment in our data library and million for research and development spending 
we will require substantial cash flow to continue our investment in multi client library  complete our capital expenditure and research and development programs  and meet our principal and interest obligations with respect to outstanding indebtedness 
while we believe that we have adequate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs  our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to many factors beyond our control 
key internal factors affecting future results include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library licensing  all of which are driven by the external factors of exploration spending and  ultimately  underlying commodity prices 
in august  we filed a shelf registration allowing the issuance of up to million in debt  preferred stock or common stock 
on october   we filed a prospectus supplement relating to the sale of up to million shares of our common stock  from time to time through ordinary brokerage transactions  under the shelf registration 
as of july   we had issued approximately million shares in connection with these transactions  generating approximately million in net proceeds 
in october  we sold million shares of stock in a public offering and netted million in proceeds 
critical accounting policies while all of our accounting policies are important in assuring that veritas adheres to current accounting standards  certain policies are particularly important due to their impact on our financial statements 
these are described in detail below 
multi client data library we collect and process geophysical data for our own account and retain all ownership rights 
we license the data to clients on a non transferable basis 
we capitalize costs associated with acquiring and processing the data 
the capitalized cost of multi client data is charged to cost of services in the period sales occur based on the percentage of total estimated costs to total estimated sales multiplied by actual sales 
any costs remaining months after completion of a survey are charged to cost of services over a period not to exceed months 
the total amortization period of sixty months represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and record losses when it is determined that estimated sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
in the fourth quarter of this year  we took a million pretax impairment charge related to surveys 
we recorded no such impairment charges in fiscal or fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the useful life of marine surveys from months to months 
we believe that months more accurately represents the time over which we will derive benefits from our current portfolio of marine surveys 
this change in accounting estimate was made prospectively and had an immaterial impact on our results for the year ended july  deferred tax asset deferred taxes result from the effect of transactions that are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is then adjusted when the realization of deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not 
adjustments are also made to recognize the expiration of net operating loss and investment tax credit carryforwards  with equal and offsetting adjustments to the related deferred tax asset 
should the income projections result in the conclusion that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than not  further adjustments to the valuation allowance are made 
since our quasi reorganization on july  with respect to digicon inc  the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to additional paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
for the year ended july   we recognized million related to these benefits 
other accounting policies we receive some accounts receivable payments in foreign currency 
we currently do not conduct a hedging program because we do not consider our current exposure to foreign currency fluctuations to be significant  although we have hedged certain future charter payments to be made in a foreign currency 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have adopted the use of these new accounting statements 
the main effect of sfas no 
is to require purchase accounting be used in all future business combinations  disallowing the pooling of interests method allowed under apb opinion no 
sfas no 
defines the recording and subsequent treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets derived from business combinations and supercedes apb opinion no 
this statement requires us to discontinue our amortization of goodwill and requires that we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when certain events trigger such a test 
we performed the initial impairment tests in january  and will retest at least annually 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred with the liability being initially measured at fair value 
we will adopt the use of this accounting statement in fiscal and do not expect adoption to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale  requiring such assets to be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of liabilities for the obligations arising from disposal activities 
we will adopt the use of this accounting statement in fiscal and do not expect adoption to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections as of april 
among other things  this statement addresses how to report gains or losses resulting from the early extinguishment of debt 
previously  any gains or losses were reported as an extraordinary item 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 an entity will be required to evaluate whether the debt extinguishment is truly extraordinary in nature  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
we will adopt the use of this accounting statement in fiscal the adoption of this statement will preclude extraordinary classification of costs related to early debt extinguishment 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than when management commits to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by this guidance include lease termination costs  employee severance costs that are associated with restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closings  or other exit or disposal activities 
we will adopt the use of this accounting statement in fiscal year we have not yet completed our evaluation of the effect of this statement on our accounting practices 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks discussed below 
you should carefully consider these discussions of risks and the other information included in this report 
as a provider of geophysical technologies  our business is substantially dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
these capital expenditures may also be affected by worldwide economic conditions 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies  as we have experienced in recent years  the demand for geophysical services likely will drop and there will be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period 
weak demand or technological obsolescence could impair the value of our multi client data library  changes in accounting practices could affect our methods of accounting for our multi client data library 
we have invested significant amounts in acquiring and processing multi client data and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will recover all the costs of such surveys 
technological  regulatory or other industry or general economic developments could render all or portions of our multi client data library obsolete or reduce its value 
in accordance with industry practice  we capitalize our investments in our multi client library and charge these investments to cost of services as sales are made 
certain accounting authorities are reviewing accounting practices relating to the capitalization of expenditures made in the development of certain databases  particularly in the context of e commerce companies 
we cannot predict whether future accounting changes could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations 
we are dependent on achieving and maintaining technological advances  which creates risks regarding technological obsolescence  requirements for substantial future capital expenditures  the unavailability of necessary technology and the failure of new technologies 
the development of geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be required to invest substantial capital in the future to maintain our technology 
furthermore  manufacturers of geophysical equipment may develop new systems that render our equipment  even if recently acquired  obsolete or less desirable  requiring significant additional capital expenditures 
since some of our competitors are themselves leading designers and manufacturers of seismic equipment  we may not have access to their technology 
even if critical new and advanced equipment is available to us  we may not have funds available or be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms to acquire it 
further  any investment we may make in a perceived technological advance may not be effective  economically successful or otherwise accepted in the market 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could adversely affect our results 
competition among geophysical service providers historically has been  and will continue to be  intense 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
some of our competitors operate substantially more data acquisition crews than we do and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
these larger and better financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for contract awards and data sales and in the development of new technologies 
other competitors operate with extremely low overhead and compete vigorously on price in certain markets where that is the determining factor in awarding work 
these low cost competitors can have a competitive advantage over us in these markets 
high fixed costs could result in operating losses 
our business has high fixed costs 
as a result  downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand  weather interruptions  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses 
low utilization rates may hamper our ability to recover the cost of necessary capital investments 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period 
our operating results may  in the future  vary in material respects from quarter to quarter 
factors that could cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition  customers budgetary cycles  the timing of offshore lease sales and the effect of such timing on the demand for geophysical activities  seasonal factors and the timing of sales of geophysical data from our multi client data library  which may be significant to us and which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern 
combined with our high fixed costs  these revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry 
we may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel  particularly during periods of increased demand for geophysical services 
in addition  our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior management  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business 
we face risks associated with our foreign revenue generating activities 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from foreign activities and  as a result  significant portions of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
these revenues are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net assets reflected on the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore on our consolidated balance sheet  are subject to currency fluctuations 
foreign revenues are also subject to special risks that may disrupt markets  including the risk of war  terrorism  civil disturbances  embargo  and government activities 
revenue generating activities in certain foreign countries may require prior united states government approval in the form of an export license and otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenues and  in particular  adverse effects from foreign currency fluctuations 
we operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personal injuries and may interrupt our business 
our seismic data acquisition activities involve operating under extreme weather and other hazardous conditions 
these operations are subject to risks of loss to property and injury to personnel from fires  accidental explosions  ice floes  and high seas 
these events could result in an interruption of our business or significant liability 
we may not obtain insurance against all risks or for certain equipment located from time to time in certain areas of the world 
the trading price of our securities could be subject to significant fluctuations 
the trading prices of our securities fluctuate 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial performance  and that of our competitors  as well as general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our securities 
the trading prices also may be affected by weakness in oil prices  changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control 
these factors may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
our business is subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect our future operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  provincial  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws 
we invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit requirements 
failure to timely obtain the required permits may result in crew downtime and operating losses 
because laws and regulations change frequently  we cannot predict the impact of government regulations on our future operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration by oil and gas companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our geophysical services 
certain provisions of our charter  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our stockholders 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of the company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock  and establish advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer  proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us  even if viewed favorably by stockholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us 
cautionary statements about forward looking statements this report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference contain forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements include statements incorporated by reference to other veritas dgc documents filed with the sec 
forward looking statements include  among other things  business strategy and expectations concerning industry conditions  market position  future operations  margins  profitability  liquidity and capital resources 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate or believe or the negatives thereof 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectation will be correct 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report on form k 
our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside our control  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk at july   we had limited market risk related to foreign currencies 
in march  we entered into a contract requiring payments in norwegian kroner to charter the seismic vessel m v seisquest 
the contract requires monthly payments commencing on june  to protect our exposure to exchange rate risk  we entered into multiple forward contracts as cash flow hedges fixing our exchange rates for norwegian kroner to the us dollar 
the total fair value of the open forward contracts at july  in us dollars is million 
at july   we had million of fixed rate debt maturing in october with a fair value of million at july
