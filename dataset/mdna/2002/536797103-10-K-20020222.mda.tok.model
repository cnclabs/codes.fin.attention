item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of february   we offered brands of new vehicles through franchises in stores in the western united states and over the internet 
as of february   we operate stores in oregon  in california  in washington  in colorado  in idaho  in nevada  in texas  in south dakota and in alaska 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sell replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrange related financing and insurance for our automotive customers 
during an economic downturn  customers tend to shift towards the purchase of more reasonably priced new vehicle models or used vehicles 
many customers decide to delay purchasing a new vehicle and instead repair existing vehicles 
in addition  manufacturers typically offer increased dealer and customer incentives during an economic downturn in order to support new vehicle sales volume 
these factors lead to less volatility in earnings for automobile retailers than for automobile manufacturers 
historically  new vehicle sales account for approximately of our total revenues but less than of total gross profit 
we emphasize sales of higher margin products  which generate over of our gross profits 
our revenues and gross profit by product line were as follows for percent of gross percent of total total revenues margin gross profit new vehicles retail used vehicles service  body and parts finance and insurance fleet and other excludes wholesale used vehicle sales  representing of total revenues and a reduction in gross margin of

total revenues increased to record levels for compared to due to acquisitions  which were partially offset by same store retail sales decreasing 
the decrease in same store retail sales was due to a slower new vehicle sales environment in the first three quarters of  offset in part by same store increases in used vehicle and finance and insurance sales 
during the fourth quarter of  manufacturers offered  and are continuing to offer in the first quarter of  incentives  including low interest rates and rebates  in order to attract new vehicle buyers 
these incentives  along with improvements in our core operations  contributed to same store sales growth of in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the availability of cash rebates and zero percent and low interest rate financing have also enhanced our ability to sell finance  warranty and insurance products and services

liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements for at least twelve months from december  these resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated acquisitions through in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
we have purchased  shares under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
we have credit facilities with ford motor credit company totaling million  which expire december   with interest due monthly 
the facilities include million for new and program vehicle flooring  million for used vehicle flooring and million for store acquisitions 
we also have the option to convert the acquisition line into a five year term loan 
the credit lines with ford motor credit are cross collateralized and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
we pledged to ford motor credit the stock of all of our subsidiaries except entities operating bmw  honda  nissan or toyota stores 

table of contents the financial covenants in our agreement with ford motor credit require us to maintain compliance with  among other things  specified ratios total debt to tangible base capital  specified ratios of total adjusted debt to tangible base capital  specific current ratio  specific fixed charge coverage ratio  and positive net cash 
the ford motor credit agreements also preclude the payment of cash dividends without prior consent 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  toyota financial services  daimlerchrysler financial corporation and general motors acceptance corporation have agreed to floor all of our new vehicles for their respective brands with ford motor credit serving as the primary lender for all other brands 
these new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant brands 
we also have a real estate line of credit with toyota financial services totaling million  which expires july  this line of credit is secured by the real estate financed under this line of credit 
in february  this line of credit was increased to million 
in addition  us bank us has extended a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles and equipment purchases  which expires january interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december  together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands remaining outstanding at availability as of december  december  new and program vehicle lines used vehicle line acquisition line real estate lines equipment leased vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
at december   we had capital commitments of approximately million for the construction of three new store facilities and additions to two existing facilities  all of which is anticipated to be incurred in we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and buying patterns  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
historically  the timing and frequency of acquisitions has been the largest contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on july   and sfas no 
on january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  but before sfas no 
was adopted in full  were not amortized  but evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized and tested for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting requirements prior to the adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires  upon adoption of sfas no 
 that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that we acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
we do not anticipate reclassifying any intangibles to intangibles with determinable useful lives 
for intangible assets identified as having indefinite useful lives  we are required to test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period and recognize any impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
we do not anticipate incurring any impairment loss charges upon adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   we expect a reduction in annual amortization expense of approximately million in upon adoption of sfas no 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory 
the interest rate on the flooring debt is tied to either the one month libor  the three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  net of tax  in based on amounts outstanding on the lines of credit at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we currently have hedged approximately of our flooring debt 
the interest rate swaps change the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of the flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we have entered into the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective september  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum 
effective november  a three year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum 
we earn interest on both of the million interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate adjusted on the first and sixteenth of every month and we are obligated to pay interest at the fixed rate set for each swap or per annum on the same amount 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation accrued is received or paid each month and is recorded in the statement of operations as flooring interest expense 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not speculate using derivative instruments 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and the amount of hedging losses deferred on interest rate swaps was million at december  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reported  net of related income taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense 
table of contents as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the flooring debt affects earnings 
because the critical terms of the interest rate swap and the underlying debt obligation are the same  there was no ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
incremental interest expense incurred as a result of the interest rate swaps was million in interest expense savings on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates during was approximately million 
at current interest rates  we estimate that we will incur additional interest expense  net of tax  of approximately million related to our interest rate swaps during risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and our forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
as a result  interest rate declines during have resulted in a net reduction of our interest expense for compared to what it would have been at similar debt levels with no interest rate decline 
we intend to continue to gradually hedge our interest rate exposure if market rates continue to decline
