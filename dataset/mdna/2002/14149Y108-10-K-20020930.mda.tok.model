general the company operates within four operating business segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services  medical surgical products and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services  and automation and information services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these segments 
results of operations operating revenue percent of total growth operating revenues years ended june pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical surgical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company growth is calculated as the change increase or decrease in the operating revenue for a given year as a percentage of the operating revenue in the immediately preceding year 
total operating revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is a result of a higher sales volume across various customer segments  strong sales of self manufactured products  pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately  addition of new products  and the addition of new customers  some of which was a result of new corporate agreements with healthcare providers 
total operating revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in operating revenue resulted from a higher sales volume to existing customers  pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately  acquisitions  and addition of new customers  some of which was a result of cross selling opportunities among the various businesses 
for further discussion of acquisitions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal is a result of strong sales to all customer segments  especially retail pharmacy and grocery chains and alternate site customers  each of which yielded growth  as well as strong growth in mail order and government customers 
a portion of the fiscal growth is attributable to pharmaceutical price increases and the addition of new contracts 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal resulted from strong sales to all customer segments  especially chain pharmacies  which provided growth  an increase in sales volume to existing customers  pharmaceutical price increases  and the addition of new contracts 
the medical surgical products and services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal is a result of strong sales of self manufactured products  particularly sales of surgical instruments and custom kits for surgical procedures  as well as price increases and increases in sales of distributed products 
several new long term contracts were signed within the segment s distribution business 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal primarily reflected an increase in sales of distributed products 
the company acquired bergen brunswig medical corporation bbmc in the first quarter of fiscal and accounted for the acquisition as a purchase transaction 
as this transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  prior year revenues for this segment do not include bbmc revenues prior to acquisition 
excluding bbmc revenues in  the total operating revenues grew approximately over fiscal the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal resulted from higher sales volume particularly involving development and analytical services  pharmaceutical technologies  and its proprietary packaging offerings 
products that showed particular strength were abbott s kaletra r  an aids product  lilly s zyprexa r zydis r  an anti psychotic  and pharmacia s detrol r la  an incontinence medication 
accelerating demand for sterile liquid and controlled release technologies in addition to the acquisition of sp pharmaceuticals  was a significant contributor to the growth within the pharmaceutical technologies business 
the completion of the magellan acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to the growth in the analytical services business 
excluding the revenues of sp pharmaceuticals and magellan  operating revenues grew approximately over fiscal additionally  the segment experienced growth in its pharmaceutical packaging business which was attributable to the addition of several new customers and increased volume from existing customers 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal resulted from higher sales volume particularly involving the zydis r rapid dissolving drug delivery technology and the sterile liquid pharmaceutical products 
slowing sales in the protease inhibitor and health and nutritional product lines partially offset the growth in this segment in both fiscal years 
the automation and information services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal primarily resulted from strong sales in the patient safety and supply management product lines  such as medstation sn r and supplystation r system significant sales of new products including anesthesia system and products within the supplystation line also contributed to this segment s growth 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal primarily reflected sales of new products  such as the medstation r sn  which was introduced in late fiscal  and further penetration of the market with existing automation products 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses 
the company reports bulk deliveries made to customers warehouses as revenue 
these sales involve the company acting as an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of pharmaceutical products 
fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that the company cannot control  including consolidation within the customers industries  decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue warehousing activities  changes in policies by manufacturers related to selling directly to customers  and the addition or loss of customers 
due to the lack of margin generated through bulk deliveries  fluctuations in their amount have no significant impact on the company s net earnings 
gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue years ended june pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical surgical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company the overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased in fiscal and fiscal this decrease resulted from a greater mix of lower margin pharmaceutical distribution operating revenues in fiscal and fiscal as compared to the prior years 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment represented of operating revenues in fiscal  up from and of operating revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decline in the margins in the medical surgical products and services and automation and information services segments also contributed to the overall decline in the company s gross margin 
the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment decreased in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the highly competitive market within the pharmaceutical distribution industry and a greater mix of high volume customers where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer lower selling margins to its customers 
in addition  this segment s gross margin was negatively impacted by several non recurring items  primarily related to the bindley integration 
the company incurred a one time inventory adjustment related to the process of closing and rationalizing facilities in addition to the integration of the operations of bindley and cardinal 
these decreases were partially offset by higher vendor margins from favorable price increases and manufacturer marketing programs 
gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue declined in fiscal primarily due to the impact of lower selling margins 
the decline in selling margins was attributed to a highly competitive market and greater mix of high volume customers where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer lower selling margins to its customers 
this decrease was partially offset by higher vendor margins from favorable price increases and manufacturer marketing programs 
the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the medical surgical products and services segment decreased in fiscal primarily due to competitive pricing pressures on distributed products 
this decline was partially offset by manufacturing productivity improvements and a higher sales volume of self manufactured products which carry significantly higher gross margins than other portions of this segment s business 
in fiscal  the decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of bbmc 
this acquisition shifted product mix toward lower margin distributed products 
the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue increased during fiscal this increase was primarily due to a larger mix of higher margin pharmaceutical products versus health and nutritional products  as well as cost efficiencies due to recent infrastructure investments at manufacturing facilities 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of certain items that occurred in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal  namely revenues related to the use of certain of the company s proprietary technology 
this segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue increased in fiscal versus fiscal due to an increase in sales volume in the higher margin liquid fill contract manufacturing and drug delivery system businesses 
the drug delivery system business shift to higher margin pharmaceutical products from lower margin health and nutrition products also contributed to the improvement in gross margin 
in addition  during both fiscal and  the company recognized pricing adjustments related to the minimum recovery expected to be received for claims against vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these pricing adjustments were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  consistent with the classification of the original overcharge  and were based on the minimum amounts estimated to be recoverable based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they were recorded 
the amounts recorded for these pricing adjustments were million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the second quarter of fiscal the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the automation and information services segment decreased in fiscal and fiscal  primarily due to changes in its product mix as a result of increased sales of supplystation which generates a lower gross margin than the medication line of products due to the relatively less complex nature of the product 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue years ended june pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical surgical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company in fiscal and fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue include goodwill amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue declined in fiscal and fiscal this decline reflects economies of scale associated with the company s revenue growth 
significant productivity gains resulting from continued cost control efforts in all segments and the continuation of consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities contributed to the improvement 
in addition  the company is continuing to take advantage of synergies from recent acquisitions to decrease selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue 
in fiscal  the company ceased amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion which also contributed to the improvement 
goodwill amortization expense in fiscal was approximately million 
in addition  the company realized productivity and operating efficiencies as a result of implementing changes at pyxis to better service its customers 
partially offsetting the improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was an increase in these expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment 
this change was primarily a result of surplus capacity in the health and nutritional manufacturing facilities for this segment 
the selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding goodwill amortization  grew and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal and is attributed primarily to an increase in personnel costs  which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the overall increase 
the overall increase compares favorably to the and growth in operating revenue for the same periods

certain merger related and restructuring costs are based upon estimates 
actual amounts paid may ultimately differ from these estimates 
if additional costs are incurred or recorded amounts exceed costs  such changes in estimates will be recorded in special charges when incurred 
the company estimates that it will incur additional merger related costs associated with the various merger transactions completed to date totaling approximately million million net of tax in future periods 
additional discussion related to the company s merger transactions is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that it will incur these costs in order to properly integrate operations a portion of which represents facility rationalizations and implementing efficiencies with regard to  among other things  information systems  customer systems  marketing programs and administrative functions 
such amounts will be charged to expense when incurred 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement the company s existing operations and b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  the company continually evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry through all its reporting segments 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  the company would incur additional merger related costs 
interest expense and other 
the decrease in interest expense and other of million during fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of lower interest rates on borrowings throughout the year and effective asset management 
in addition  the company recognized a one time gain on an equity investment  contributing to the overall decline 
the increase in interest expense and other of million during fiscal was a result of higher average levels of borrowing during fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes relative to pretax earnings were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared with in fiscal and for fiscal the fluctuation in the tax rate is primarily due to the impact of recording certain non deductible merger related costs during various periods as well as fluctuating state and foreign effective tax rates as a result of the company s business mix for all three fiscal years 
in addition  effective july   the company ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
this contributed to the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal the provisions for income taxes excluding the impact of merger related charges and of goodwill were  and for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company through its pharmaceutical and other healthcare distribution activities and are presented net of an allowance of doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from one year to ten years  at interest rates that generally fluctuate with the prime rate 
the financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance involve the use of a substantial amount of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance  the company reviews the industry trends and the customer s financial strength  credit standing  and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
inventories 
a majority of inventories approximately in and in are stated at lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method  or market  and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been higher 
below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory june  fifo inventory    lifo reserve valuation total inventory    goodwill 
the company elected to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets beginning with the first quarter of fiscal under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
accordingly  the company has ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of july  intangible assets with finite lives  primarily patents and trademarks  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company completed the required impairment testing in fiscal and did not incur any impairment charges 
special charges 
the company primarily records costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity as special charges 
these costs are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
certain costs  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  are recognized at the date the integration or restructuring plan is formalized and adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs are estimated based on historical experience of the total costs incurred in exiting a facility 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
actual costs could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expenses 
these adjustments will be recorded as special charges 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to billion at june  from billion at june  this increase primarily resulted from additional investments in inventories during fiscal inventories increased by billion from year to year  which reflects the higher level of business volume in pharmaceutical distribution and provider services activities

the company has several operating lease financing arrangements that are expected to be used for the construction of new facilities as well as for equipment see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
shareholders equity increased to billion at june  from billion at june  the increase was primarily due to net earnings of billion and the investment of million by employees of the company through various stock incentive plans
