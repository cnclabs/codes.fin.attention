you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
overview jakks was founded to design  develop  produce and market children s toys and related products 
we commenced business operations on july  when we assumed operating control over the toy business of justin products limited justin which consisted primarily of fashion dolls and accessories and electronic products for children 
one of our key strategies has been to grow through the acquisition or licensing of product lines  concepts and characters 
since our founding  we have broadly expanded our product lines to include many diverse products including some based on licensed characters and properties  such as world wrestling federation action figures and accessories 
we acquired road champs in february  and have included the results of operations of road champs from february   the effective date of the acquisition 
we acquired the child guidance and remco trademarks in october  both of which contributed to operations nominally in  but contributed more significantly to operations commencing in we acquired berk in june and have included the results of operations of berk since june  in october  we acquired flying colors toys 
the flying colors product lines contributed to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of in july  we acquired pentech international whose products include writing instruments and activity items 
the pentech products contributed nominally to operations beginning in the second quarter of our products currently include action figures and accessories featuring licensed characters  principally from the world wrestling federation  flying colors molded plastic activity sets  compound playsets and lunch boxes  wheels division products  including road champs die cast collectible and toy vehicles and remco toy vehicles and role play toys and accessories  pentech writing instruments and activity products  child guidance infant and pre school electronic toys  toy foam puzzle mats and blocks  activity sets and outdoor products and fashion dolls and related accessories 
we have a fifty percent interest in a joint venture with thq  a developer  publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment software  and the joint venture licensed the rights from world wrestling federation entertainment to publish world wrestling federation electronic video games on all platforms 
the first games produced under this license  which expires initially december  and has a five year renewal option  were released in november through june   we are entitled to receive a guaranteed preferred return at varying rates of net sales of the video games depending on the cumulative unit sales and platform of each particular game  which we accrue in the quarter the games are sold 
thq retains the financial risk of the joint venture and is responsible for the day to day operations  including the development  sales and distribution of the licensed games for which they are entitled to receive the balance of any profits 
for periods after june   the amount of the preferred return will be subject to renegotiation 
table of contents between thq and us 
distributions of the preferred return from the joint venture contributed significantly to our pre tax income  representing of pre tax income in  in and in the annual minimum preferred return to be distributed to us by the joint venture during each of the years in the period ending december  is million per year 
we expect our aggregate return over this period to be significantly in excess of this amount  although we cannot predict with certainty that expected levels of return will be achieved and  in any case  we anticipate substantial fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed to us from year to year 
the amount of our preferred return in any year will be subject to various factors  including the number of games released  life cycle of hardware platforms  market conditions and changes in consumer interests 
in general  we acquire products or product concepts from others or we engage unaffiliated third parties to develop our own products  thus minimizing operating costs 
royalties payable to our developers generally range from to of the wholesale price for each unit of a product sold by us 
we expect that outside inventors will continue to be a source of new products in the future 
we also generate internally new product concepts  for which we pay no royalties 
we contract the manufacture of most of our products to unaffiliated manufacturers located in china 
we sell the finished products on a letter of credit basis or on open account to our customers  who take title to the goods in hong kong or china 
these methods allow us to reduce certain operating costs and working capital requirements 
a portion of our sales originate in the united states  so we hold certain inventory in our warehouse and fulfillment facilities 
to date  substantially all of our sales have been to domestic customers 
we intend to expand distribution of our products into foreign territories and  accordingly  we have acquired kidz biz  a united kingdom based distributor of toys and related products that will serve as our european headquarters  engaged representatives to oversee sales in certain territories  engaged distributors in certain territories  such as funtastic in australia  and established direct relationships with retailers in certain territories 
we establish reserves for sales allowances  including promotional allowances and allowances for anticipated defective product returns  at the time of shipment 
the reserves are determined as a percentage of net sales based upon either historical experience or on estimates or programs agreed upon by our customers 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of goods produced for us by unaffiliated third party manufacturers  royalties earned by licensors on the sale of these goods and amortization of the tools  dies and molds owned by us that are used in the manufacturing process 
other costs include inbound freight and provisions for obsolescence 
significant factors affecting our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include the proportion of net sales generated by various products with disparate gross margins  the proportion of net sales made domestically  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales made in hong kong  and the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily amortization of tools  dies and molds  over varying levels of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process  such as sales commissions  advertising and travel expenses  as well as general corporate expenses  goodwill and trademark amortization and product development 
we have recorded goodwill of approximately million and trademarks of approximately million in connection with acquisitions made to date 
goodwill has been amortized over a year period  while trademark acquisition costs have been amortized over periods ranging from to years 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  goodwill and certain intangible assets will be written down on an impairment basis where losses in value will be recorded when and as material impairment has occurred in the underlying assets

quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
recent acquisition on march   we purchased  shares of the common stock of toymax international  inc toymax from four of its stockholders 
the aggregate purchase price for these shares was approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
prior to that date  we had acquired  shares of toymax common stock  so that  as of march   we owned  shares of toymax common stock  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of toymax common stock 
in connection with this acquisition  toymax s board of directors has been reconfigured to consist of six directors designated by jakks and two directors who had been serving prior to the closing of the acquisition 
in addition  certain of our executive officers have been installed as toymax s senior management 
to complete our acquisition of toymax  we have entered into an agreement of merger with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries newco and toymax the merger agreement pursuant to which the parties have agreed that  subject to the conditions set forth therein  including  among others  the approval by toymax s stockholders at a meeting to be convened for such purpose  newco will merge into toymax in a transaction the merger in which the surviving corporation will become one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the stockholders of toymax  except for us  newco or toymax or a subsidiary thereof  will receive merger consideration consisting of in cash and share of our common stock subject to certain contingent adjustments

we currently estimate that the merger consideration payable in the merger which is subject to certain conditions and contingent 
table of contents adjustments will consist of approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have any outstanding balances on our line of credit  and we have only nominal interest bearing obligations 
accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and the united kingdom 
sales from hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars 
however  domestic sales from the united kingdom  purchases of inventory and operating expenses are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
with respect to the british pound  we will monitor its volatility frequently throughout the coming year 
while we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging  we may in the future use hedging programs to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of these currencies
