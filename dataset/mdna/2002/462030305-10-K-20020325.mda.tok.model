item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to revenue recognition  price protection and volume rebate reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company s customers include oems  retailers  distributors  value added manufacturers and end users 
some retail and distribution customer agreements have provisions that allow the customer to return product under certain conditions within specified time periods 
revenue  less reserves for estimated returns  is generally recognized upon shipment to the customer 
the company has established reserves for estimated returns  which are reflected as a reduction in trade receivables and sales in the consolidated financial statements 
the reserve for estimated returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the estimated returns are calculated using historical return rates 
to the extent that future return rates are different than the historical rates used in estimating the return reserve  the amount by which trade receivables and sales were reduced could be significantly different 
in addition to reserves for estimated returns  the company defers recognition of revenue on estimated excess inventory in the distribution and retail channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels day requirements as estimated by management 
the channel s day requirements are estimated based on inventory and sell through amounts reported to the company by the company s key customers 
the company defers estimated sales and cost of sales associated with excess channel inventory in its consolidated financial statements 
the gross margin associated with deferral of revenue for estimated excess channel inventory totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in margin on deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
price protection and volume rebates the company has agreements with certain of its customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to limitations credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units either in the customers inventories on the date of the price decrease  or on the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  the company establishes reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  the company records reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and estimated rebates given to consumers at time of purchase from channel partners for which revenue has been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of mail in rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
reserves for volume rebates and price protection credits totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are netted against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in this reserve for resulted primarily from increased zip and cd rw rebate programs implemented to stimulate sales and increased cd rw price protections driven by rapidly decreasing cd rw prices 
the company believes that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of the company s business strategy 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts by applying specified percentages to the different receivable aging categories 
the percentage applied against the aging categories increases as the accounts become further past due 
accounts in excess of days past due are generally fully reserved 
in addition  specific reserves are established for specific customer accounts identified as known collection problems occur due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
the company s customer base is quite concentrated and changes in either the customer s financial position or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated reserve 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
the company includes material costs  manufacturing costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  the company generally considers that inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next nine months as excess and thus appropriate reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 
for example  during the second and third quarters of  the company established inventory reserves on several of the company s products  including cd rw  hipzip  fotoshow and peerless as the sales prices fell below the company s costs of the respective product and or the amount of inventory on hand exceeded sales expectations 
deferred income tax valuation allowances the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
as deferred tax assets or liabilities increase or decrease in the future  or if a portion or all of the valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  the adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease future income tax provisions 
for example  during the third quarter of  the company established a us valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of its domestic deferred tax assets 
after considering its forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  the company concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the third quarter 
in the future  as business conditions change  the company s confidence associated with the likelihood of the realizability of the deferred tax assets may change resulting in either an increase or a decrease in the valuation allowance 
at december   the company s net deferred tax assets were million 
if the company is unable to support the recovery of these deferred tax assets  it would be required to provide additional valuation reserves for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 
business segment information the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements operations and significant accounting policies 
intersegment sales  eliminated in consolidation  are not material 
the company evaluates performance based on product profit margin ppm for each segment 
ppm is defined as sales and other income directly related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable manufacturing costs  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses directly related to a segment s operations 
when such costs and expenses exceed sales and other income  ppm is referred to as product loss

the company s pocketzip products were targeted to the enterprise and retail consumer markets and to various electronics device oems 
the company s peerless drive system is targeted to business professional and enterprise markets

management believes the markets for the company s products are generally seasonal  with a higher proportional share of total sales typically occurring in the fourth quarter and sales slowdowns commonly occurring during the first quarter and summer months 
this historic pattern could  however  be affected by the significant weakness and uncertainty that currently exists in the united states and global economies and consumer confidence levels 
accordingly  sales and growth rates for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales or growth rates to be expected in any future quarter

the million in pocketzip pc card drive inventory charges was due to a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of pocketzip pc card drives because expected undiscounted cash flows would not enable recovery of costs 
non restructuring charges second quarter the million of non restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of was comprised of million for excess jaz manufacturing equipment and million for a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik mobile drive inventory 
as a result of its normal quarterly review of manufacturing equipment  a charge of million was taken for excess jaz manufacturing equipment 
this excess equipment was created in the second quarter due to a decline in the estimated demand for jaz products in the second quarter and future quarters  which demonstrated future undiscounted cash flow losses associated with the assets 
the million in clik mobile drive inventory charges were due to a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik mobile drives because expected undiscounted cash flows would not cover material costs  manufacturing costs and direct selling expenses due to a decline in demand 
the clik platform renamed to pocketzip in was relatively new and it did not start shipping in volumes until the first quarter of at december   the majority of the clik mobile drive units had been scrapped or used as warranty replacement units

the million in ditto finished drive inventory charges was a result of excess ditto finished drives that the company was no longer allowed to sell as a result of a contract entered into during the first quarter of in connection with the sale of the ditto assets 
the buyer who had purchased certain ditto assets in the first quarter of was expected to purchase the remaining ditto finished drive inventory at the company s carrying value in the third quarter 
however  in the third quarter  the buyer informed the company that it did not have the financial ability to purchase the remaining ditto finished drives 
at december   the company had disposed of the majority of these remaining ditto finished drives 
the million charge for excess and obsolete zip and jaz remanufactured drive components was taken as a result of lower demand from customers for remanufactured drives and an increase in the available number of remanufactured drives created by returned drives from retail customers 
in addition  the company changed its process for handling warranty drives during the third quarter of  which created excess and obsolete components 
at december   the majority of these components had been scrapped 
the million of charges for excess clik disk manufacturing equipment and other equipment were primarily the result of the company not achieving its anticipated drive volumes that resulted in a decline in overall disk volumes 
as a consequence  future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to cover the net book value of the applicable assets 
fourth quarter the million of non restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of were all related to the company s clik family of products and was comprised of million for excess inventory on hand  million for a supplier commitment to purchase additional inventory  and million in excess manufacturing equipment which represented the carrying value of the equipment associated with the clik pc card drive  million associated with a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik disks  and million associated with excess inventory and a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of the clik digital camera bundle 
the million supplier commitment related to clik pc card drive inventory which the supplier had manufactured for the company and the company was required to purchase 
since the company already had clik pc card drive inventory on hand that was considered excess  the million was reserved 
the company began shipping the clik pc card drive in limited quantities in june during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it had over estimated demand for the product in the market  which created inventory recoverability issues and probable losses associated with non cancelable purchase orders 
the lower volume of drives being sold in the market also impacted clik disk volume and therefore  created inventory recoverability issues associated with clik disks  resulting in a reduction of the net realizable value of clik disk inventory 
the charges associated with the clik digital camera bundle inventory resulted from the fact that during the fourth quarter  the company had to abandon its plans to sell its remaining clik digital camera bundle inventory because a discontinued component by a vendor made it impossible to complete final assembly 
at december   the clik digital camera bundle inventory described above had been disposed 
the clik pc card drive and disk inventory is continuing to be sold near breakeven

depreciation and rent were charged to normal operations until the facilities were vacated 
the majority of the manufacturing equipment tooling associated with the discontinued products and projects were tooling items located at vendors outside of the united states 
due to various requirements in these countries  it has taken longer than expected to dispose of these assets 
these fixed assets have not been utilized since the restructuring actions were announced 
the company planned on terminating the employment of individuals in connection with the second quarter restructuring actions 
at that time  the company paid severance on a continuous basis as opposed to a lump sum payment 
several of the employees in california were offered retention packages requiring them to continue to work for the company into the third or fourth quarters of and therefore  their severance pay did not begin until later in the retention packages were offered to individuals at all levels of development and administrative functions necessary to transfer product and process knowledge to roy  utah and close down the facilities in milpitas and san diego  california

during the second quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the discontinuance of development projects 
the excess restructuring reserves were a result of negotiating reductions in purchase commitments or cancellation charges on inventory and vendor equipment and higher than expected proceeds from equipment disposals 
additionally in the second quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring charges associated with clik product streamlining as a result of the company negotiating reductions in purchase commitments 
during the third quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the closure of facilities in milpitas  california 
the excess restructuring reserves were a result of the company being able to terminate a lease earlier than originally anticipated and the company being able to sublease certain of the facilities at higher rates than had been anticipated 
also in the third quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the clik product streamlining 
due to the development of the company s hipzip digital audio player during the third quarter of  it was determined that certain clik manufacturing equipment  previously reserved in the third quarter of as part of the restructuring reserves  could be utilized in the company s penang facility 
as of december   all of the restructuring reserves associated with the us restructuring actions had been utilized which included disposal of equipment  tooling and inventory and payment of purchase commitments associated with discontinued products  discontinued development projects and clik product streamlining  disposal of furniture and leasehold improvements and payment of leases associated with the shutdown of the san diego and milpitas  california facilities  payment of severance and benefits in the united states and disposition of all france and scotland assets and liabilities except for the contract obligations  other commitments  severance and benefits and some accounts receivables in france

the contract obligations in france remain under dispute and therefore have not been settled 
the company is unable to predict when the litigation relating to these obligations will be resolved 
thus there was no utilization of the contract obligation reserves during year ended december  there can be no assurance that the company s cessation of manufacturing operations in france will not result in significant legal or other costs that have not been accrued for in the restructuring charges

for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on pre tax income of million  reflecting a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  partially offset by a million tax provision 
excluding the million decrease in the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate for was 
the tax benefit of million  excluding the million increase in the valuation allowance  differs by million from the benefit of million computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the pre tax loss of million  primarily due to the tax effect of state income taxes 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
during the third quarter of  the company established a us valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of its domestic deferred tax assets 
after considering its forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  the company concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the third quarter 
in the future  as business conditions change  the company s confidence associated with the likelihood of the realizability of the deferred tax assets may change resulting in either an increase or a decrease in the valuation allowance 
the remaining million increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign net deferred tax assets associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
during  the million decrease in the valuation allowance reflected a reduction in deferred tax assets of million  an increase in deferred tax liabilities of million and the determination that a valuation allowance related to domestic operations was no longer required for net deferred tax assets of million at december  a number of factors  including several consecutive quarters of consolidated and us pre tax income  led to a higher degree of confidence in the company s ability to realize the net deferred tax assets of million at december  at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards  which reflected the tax benefit of approximately million in future domestic tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through the company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which reflect the tax benefit of approximately million in future tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in these deferred tax assets remain fully reserved because their realization is dependent on earning future foreign taxable income in the tax jurisdictions to which the net operating loss carryforwards related 
the largest of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards relates to the company s french subsidiary  nomai sa this subsidiary s operations have been shut down and therefore  the foreign net operating loss carryforward related to nomai sa is not likely to be realized in the future 
at december   the company had total deferred tax assets of million related to foreign and domestic operations 
these total deferred tax assets reflect the tax benefit of temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets for the company at december  were million 
the minimum amount of future taxable income that would have to be generated to realize the net deferrred tax assets is approximately million 
management believes that the company s recent restructuring efforts will reduce costs to be more in line with expected sales and will allow the company to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its net deferred tax assets 
as such  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates in the near future and  as such  realization of the net deferred tax assets is not assured 
deferred tax liabilities for estimated us federal and state taxes of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  have been accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
us taxes have not been provided for unremitted foreign earnings of million 
these earnings are considered to be permanently invested in non us operations  including the company s manufacturing operations in malaysia 
although the company has consolidated its manufacturing operations into its penang  malaysia facility to increase manufacturing efficiencies  this facility is still significantly underutilized 
the company is evaluating various alternatives to resolve this underutilization  including divestment and outsourcing of its manufacturing operations 
the resolution of this issue could ultimately result in additional charges and affect the company s status of its million of permanently invested foreign earnings 
the additional deferred us tax liability  if such amounts were no longer considered permanently invested  would be approximately million

segment ppm excluding charges and reversals total ppm for of million increased million  or  compared to total ppm of million in total ppm as a percentage of total sales was in compared to in the million increase in total ppm resulted primarily from higher zip and jaz ppm and reductions in pocketzip and other product losses 
zip segment ppm in of million  increased by million  or in  when compared to zip ppm of million in zip ppm as a percentage of zip sales increased to in  compared to in the increase was due primarily to an increased mix of higher margin zip mb products  lower overall material and variable overhead costs of million and lower operating expenses of million and a million reversal of reserves related to prior zip rebate programs as discussed above

the cd rw segment had a million product loss  or of cd rw sales in  compared to a product loss of million  or of cd rw sales in the product loss was due primarily to product development and launch costs incurred as the company introduced several new cd rw drives during the company began shipping cd rw products in limited quantities during august this segment has lower margins than the company s other segments due to the company manufacturing only a small percentage of the drives being sold 
cd rw margins benefited from increased volume  with manufacturing costs being reduced by million 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses of million resulting from new product launches and higher marketing costs 
jaz segment ppm in of million increased by million  or  compared to jaz ppm of million 
jaz ppm as a percentage of jaz sales increased to in  compared to in this increase resulted primarily from million in lower material and manufacturing costs and million in lower operating expenses when compared to these lower expenses reflect the cost savings from the restructuring actions taken in june by closing the milpitas  california facility and discontinuing certain development projects 
these margin improvements were partially offset by lower shipments of jaz drives and disks and from price reductions 
pocketzip segment product loss of million for improved million compared to a million product loss in the reduced pocketzip product loss in was primarily due to lower operating expenses of million and lower cost of sales of million  partially offset by pricing actions discussed above 
operating expenses were lower in due to lower marketing costs and research and development expenditures 
other product loss of million in improved million  or  from a product loss of million in the improved other product loss resulted primarily from the ditto segment 
in march  the company sold certain assets associated with its ditto segment  including intellectual property  exclusive manufacturing rights  software  equipment  brand names and product logos 
the company continued to sell its ditto finished drives through june and continues to sell ditto cartridges and certain ditto finished drives in accordance with the agreement entered into with the purchaser of the ditto assets 
general corporate expenses that were not allocated to ppm were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase in general corporate expenses resulted primarily from higher common sales and marketing expenses which increased by million compared to due to increased use of professional services  increased expenditures associated with the higher sales and marketing headcount and increased marketing expenditures to raise corporate brand awareness 
the remainder of the increase in general corporate expenditures was primarily from higher common product management expenditures and bonus accruals in selling  general and administrative expenses including bad debt expense or credits selling  general and administrative expenses of million for decreased by million  or  compared to the lower expenditures for were primarily from decreased sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively 
the lower sales and marketing expenses resulted from million in lower product management expenses and million in lower non advertising related sales and marketing expenditures that were partially offset by a million increase in advertising expenditures 
included in the million decrease in non advertising related sales and marketing expenditures was a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the company recorded a million bad debt credit or reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts in compared to a million bad debt expense or increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts in was a result of improved trade receivable agings due to collection of older receivables  lower overall trade receivables and recovery on specific accounts previously deemed uncollectable 
at december   the company had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  the million in higher advertising expenditures resulted primarily from the company s television advertising campaign during the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to for  primarily as a result of lower sales during research and development expenses research and development expenses of million for decreased by million  or  when compared to and decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in the million decrease was primarily the result of lower spending on pocketzip other than hipzip  jaz and zip projects partially offset by development costs associated with hipzip  fotoshow  software and peerless projects 
interest and other income and expense the company recorded interest income of million in  compared to million in  due to higher average available cash  cash equivalent and temporary investment balances in interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense resulted mainly from lower average debt balances in that resulted from paying off the million related party notes in march and the million convertible subordinated notes in october as of december   the company does not have any debt other than capital lease obligations of million 
included in other income and expense were bank charges  miscellaneous royalty income  gains and losses on disposal of assets and foreign currency gains and losses 
income taxes for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  offset by a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
this compares to an income tax provision of million in reflecting an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  offset by a million increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the provision of million  excluding the million decrease in the valuation allowance  differs by million from the provision of million computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the pre tax income of million  primarily due to the tax effect of state income taxes 
the million decrease in the valuation allowance reflects a decrease in deferred tax assets of million  an increase in deferred tax liabilities of million and the determination that a valuation allowance was no longer required for net deferred tax assets of million at december   related to domestic operations 
a number of factors  including several consecutive quarters of consolidated and us pre tax profitability  led to a higher degree of confidence in the company s ability to realize the net deferred tax assets of million at december  during the first two quarters of  the company utilized the discrete method  as outlined in footnote to paragraph of interpretation to apb opinion no 
 to record its quarterly tax provisions 
the discrete method requires the company to use its actual year to date tax rate at the end of each quarter as its estimated annual effective tax rate 
the discrete method was used during the first two quarters of because the company concluded that it could not reasonably estimate an effective tax rate for the year the company s expected pre tax results and the extent  to which valuation allowances previously established would increase or decrease  depended on a number of different factors the impact of which was not predictable 
at the end of the third quarter  based on a variety of factors including those discussed in the preceding paragraph  the company concluded that it no longer needed to maintain a valuation allowance against its us net deferred tax assets 
additionally  the company concluded at the end of the third quarter that a reasonable estimate of the full year effective tax rate could be made 
accordingly  the company changed its approach for recording income taxes from using the discrete method to using an estimated annual effective tax rate 
at december   the company had total deferred tax assets of million related to foreign and domestic operations 
these total deferred tax assets reflect the tax benefit of temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company maintained a full valuation allowance of million at december   for net deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which reflect the tax benefit of approximately million in future tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in these deferred tax assets remain fully valued because their realization is dependent on earning future foreign taxable income in the tax jurisdictions to which the net operating loss carryforwards relate 
the largest of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards relates to the company s french subsidiary  nomai sa this subsidiary s operations have been shut down and therefore  the foreign net operating loss carryforward related to nomai sa is not likely to be realized in the future 
as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  including million of deferred tax assets related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards  which reflect the tax benefit of approximately million in future domestic tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the remaining million of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  reflects the tax benefit of approximately million in future domestic tax deductions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments of million compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
at december   million of the total cash on deposit in the united states was restricted in connection with the rinaldi  et al 
v 
iomega corporation lawsuit see below for more details 
at december   million of the total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in the united states compared to million at december  at december   the remaining million of total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in foreign countries primarily western europe compared to million at december  deferred tax liabilities for estimated us federal and state taxes of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  have been accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
us taxes have not been provided for unremitted foreign earnings of million considered permanently invested 
the additional deferred us tax liability  if such amounts were no longer considered permanently invested  would be approximately million 
if the company decides to solve the underutilization problem of the company s penang  malaysia manufacturing facility through divestment or outsourcing  this divestment could ultimately result in additional charges and affect the company s status of these permanently invested foreign earnings 
cash dividends of foreign earnings such as the repatriation of any of the million of foreign cash to the us would be considered taxable in the us for federal and state tax purposes at a rate of approximately 
working capital of million decreased by million from million at december  the decrease in working capital in was primarily a result of lower cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  trade receivables and inventories  partially offset by lower accounts payable and other current liabilities 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased slightly to to at the end of  compared to to at the end of during  cash used by operating activities amounted to million  a decrease of million compared to cash provided from operating activities of million for the lower cash provided from operating activities resulted primarily from lower operating results and from changes in current assets and current liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable decreased in primarily from lower sales 
inventory decreased in primarily from lower levels of zip and jaz inventory  partially offset by increased peerless inventory 
accounts payable decreased primarily from lower levels of purchasing that resulted from lower sales volumes and cost reductions 
the decrease in other current liabilities was due to a combination of decreases in other accrued liabilities  accrued advertising  accrued payroll  deferred revenue and accrued warranty  partially offset by increases in accrued restructuring and purchase commitments 
during  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million 
during  the company repurchased  shares for million 
as of december   approximately million remained available for future repurchases under the million stock repurchase plan authorized by the company s board of directors on september  any repurchase of shares is expected to be funded using the company s available cash 
for  the company made million in cash payments related to and restructuring actions and made million in cash payments related to the second and third quarter non restructuring actions 
in connection with the class action lawsuit  rinaldi  et al 
v 
iomega corporation  as part of the court s june  order  the court issued an award of million for plaintiff attorneys fees 
the company has funded million into an escrow account 
the company has title to the escrow account and interest received on this account becomes part of the escrow balance 
however  the company is restricted to using this cash only for the payment of plaintiff attorney s fees once this lawsuit is settled 
this cash is reported separately as restricted cash in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
for more information about the lawsuit  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  previously announced stock repurchase program and cash required for restructuring and non restructuring actions and other activities during the next twelve months 
however  cash flow from operations  investing activities and the precise amount and timing of the company s future financing needs  cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the market demand for the company s products  the company s ability to stop its sales decline  competitive price pressures  worldwide economic conditions  the availability of critical components  the progress of the company s product development efforts  the financial stability of the company s customers  the necessity for future restructuring or other charges which might consume cash and the success of the company in managing its inventory  forecasting accuracy  trade receivables and accounts payable 
should the company be unable to meet its cash needs from its balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  and cash flows from operations  the company would most likely seek financing from other sources or incur additional restructuring charges to adjust the company s expenditures to a level that its cash flows could support 
the company s balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is its primary source of liquidity 
the company currently does not have a credit facility in place and given the current difficult capital markets  there is no assurance that if needed  the company would be able to obtain other sources of financing 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period obligation total less than year to years after years in thousands operating leases     restructuring commitments    purchase commitments   licensing agreements     capital lease obligations   total     the company conducts a substantial portion of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment used in its operations 
aggregate lease commitments under noncancelable operating leases are shown in the table above 
the company purchases the majority of its components on purchase orders 
these purchase orders generally extend at most one to two quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on estimated sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it can be difficult to estimate demand  which could result in excess capacity and purchase commitments 
the company s purchases commitments are shown above 
the company has entered into a licensing agreement whereby the company will make annual payments of million each january with the final payment occurring in january for use of another company s patents for research and development projects 
all capital leases are due to be paid in and thus are classified as a current liability 
see the section above entitled restructuring charges reversals for more detail on the restructuring commitments 
other matters sec review as previously disclosed in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  and form q s throughout  in connection with a review of the company s periodic sec reports  the company has received comments from the staff of the sec requesting various supplemental information and certain additional disclosures 
the staff has also questioned aspects of the company s accounting for its acquisition of nomai  the subsequent evaluation of impairment of goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring charges recorded by the company in in particular  the staff has questioned whether a in connection with the nomai acquisition  approximately million of the acquisition cost should have been recorded as post acquisition expenses  rather than as goodwill  b any remaining unamortized goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition should have been written off in the third quarter of when the company decided to cease manufacturing at the nomai facilities in avranches  france the amount of unamortized goodwill reported by the company at the end of the third quarter of was million  and c the company had in place a sufficiently detailed plan to support the restructuring charges which amounted to million and million in the second quarter and second half of  respectively 
the company s management believes that the company s accounting for each of these matters  which is described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in its position 
if the company does not prevail  the company may be required to restate its financial statements in order to adjust the manner in which it has accounted for the nomai acquisition in  the subsequent evaluation in of the impairment of the goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring actions 
the company does not believe that any such restatement would have a material adverse effect on the company s current financial condition or future results of operations

corporate headquarters change the company has relocated its corporate headquarters from roy  utah  to san diego  california 
approximately employees  of whom are being relocated from utah  are based in the san diego area 
among the functions located in san diego are the principal marketing activities  strategic product sourcing  software applications and customer advocacy  as well as executive staff members and certain personnel in human resources  legal  finance and information technology 
engineering  research and development  sales operations and various other operations such as new product introduction  supply chain management and quality  as well as certain administrative processes will remain in roy  utah 
factors affecting future operating results the company s future operating results will depend in large part on the success of its product solutions for personal computers and other devices 
although the company believes there is a market demand for personal storage devices  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing its products as the preferred solutions for those market needs 
the extent to which the company s products achieve and maintain a significant market presence will depend upon a number of factors  including the price  performance  quality and other characteristics of the company s products and of competing and substitute solutions rumored  announced or introduced by other vendors  the emergence of any competing solutions as industry standards  the success of the company in meeting targeted availability dates for new and enhanced products  the success of the company in establishing and maintaining oem arrangements and meeting oem quality  supply and other requirements  the willingness of oems to promote computers and other products containing the company s drives  the ability of the company to create consumer demand for its products  the success of the company s efforts to maintain customer service and satisfaction  the public perception of the company and its products  including statements made by industry analysts or consumers and adverse publicity resulting from such statements or from litigation filed against the company  and worldwide economic conditions  including overall market demand for personal computers and other products with which the company s products can be used 
the company s business strategy is substantially dependent on maximizing sales of its proprietary zip disks  which generates significantly higher gross and product profit margins than the related drives or other company products 
if this strategy is not successful  because the company is unable to stop the decline in drive sales  because the company is not successful in its strategy to increase disk usage by existing drive customers  because the sales mix between disks and drives is below levels anticipated by the company  because another party succeeds in producing or marketing disks that are compatible with any of the company s drive products without infringing the company s proprietary rights  because any price reductions or promotions on disks fail to produce a commensurate increase in demand  or for any other reason  then the company s sales would be adversely affected and its results of operations would be disproportionately adversely affected 
sales of zip products have accounted for a significant majority of the company s sales and profits since however  these sales have been declining and  in the fourth quarter and total year of  zip sales decreased approximately from both the fourth quarter and total year of the level of future sales of zip drives to end user customers will depend in large part on the company s ability to effectively position the zip product line features versus cd rw drives  increase the capacity of its zip products and to further reduce costs to compete against other substitute technologies 
the level of future shipments of zip drives to oem customers will depend in large part on the company s ability to further reduce the cost of zip drives and on the extent to which the incorporation of cd rw or dvd recordable drives into oem products results in a reduction in the demand for oem products also incorporating a built in zip drive 
the company believes that there is a trend among personal computer oem customers to adopt internal cd rw drives as a standard product feature and this trend has adversely impacted the company s zip business 
this trend is expected to continue and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in mitigating the adverse impact 
notwithstanding the foregoing challenges  the company s future operating results are dependent upon its ability to stabilize the zip products business and to stop the zip sales decline 
for example  during  the ppm for the zip business was million versus a product loss of million on all other product segments including restructuring and non restructuring charges 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving this critical business objective to stabilize and improve its zip business 
the company anticipates continued sales decline in the future for the jaz product platform as a result of the discontinuance of drive sales during the fourth quarter of jaz disks will continue to be available in to support the installed drive base 
during  the company achieved a ppm on its jaz business of million 
with the discontinuance of jaz  there is no assurance that the company s other high capacity storage products will generate a comparable ppm in the company s business strategy for cd rw is different from its strategy for its zip products because all of the drives are sourced from suppliers and marketed under the iomega brand name without any significant manufacturing activity by the company 
the cd rw drives do not use proprietary disks and have significantly lower overall gross margins 
given the low gross margins and frequency of new product introductions  the company must closely monitor its inventory levels  product transitions  sales channel inventory  purchase commitments  advertising and other marketing expenses in order to sell the product profitably 
there is no assurance that the company can achieve these objectives 
the cd rw drive market is very competitive and includes several established participants 
since the company s introduction of its cd rw products in  the company has reported product losses on cd rw each year 
for example  during  the company recorded a product loss of million including restructuring and non restructuring charges 
there is no assurance that the company will not incur significant losses associated with the cd rw platform in the future 
the company has developed a new business strategy around its cd rw products including the selection of a new supplier  significantly reduced overhead associated with this segment  improved inventory management processes and revised channel marketing programs 
the company began implementing this strategy in the third and fourth quarters of but there is no assurance that this strategy or the cd rw products will be successful or achieve profitability in as discussed above  the company believes that there is a trend among personal computer manufacturers to adopt internal cd rw drives as a standard product feature 
this trend is expected to continue and the company expects that this will have an adverse impact on the long term market demand for external cd rw drives 
further  the company believes that a long term transition will occur from cd rw drives to dvd recordable drives and that this transition will have an adverse impact on the long term external cd rw market 
during the second quarter of  the company began selling its peerless drive system 
in addition to the other risks described herein which relate to all of the company s products  additional risks relating to the peerless drive system include the company s dependency upon a third party for some of the key technology used in the product and the fact that a number of the potential market applications for the peerless drive system are new 
in addition to stabilization of the zip business  as discussed above  the company believes that future operating results are further dependent upon the success of the peerless drive system and other new high capacity  portable hdd offerings 
the company expects this sector to continue to be highly price competitive and the company s success will depend on its ability to meet aggressive product price and performance targets 
although encouraged by this product  the current implementation of the peerless drive faces significant cost challenges in light of continued price reductions in the portable hdd market segment in which the product competes 
as a result  in the company expects to launch newly designed portable hdd devices with the goal of achieving improved competitiveness in this market segment 
there is no assurance that the company will meet these targets or that the peerless drive system or other new high capacity hdd products will achieve profitability  significant market presence or otherwise be successful 
during  the company began selling nas devices under the datasafe brand 
in entering this space  the company is attempting to leverage its iomega brand name and its small to medium size business customer base to extend its business into the network infrastructure  or back office  as opposed to only on the personal computer desktop  or front office 
this sector is dominated by large computer and data storage providers including dell  compaq  ibm and hewlett packard  is highly price competitive  primarily relies upon value added sales channels and requires core competencies in server  software and networking technologies 
the company is developing a strategy to address these requirements and challenges 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in developing the necessary core competencies in this market segment  that the company s nas products will be successful  that the company will be successful in implementing its back office strategy  or will achieve profitability on this product line in since the introduction of the pocketzip product line in  the company has incurred cumulative product losses of million 
these product losses included non restructuring charges  totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company has taken significant charges related to the net realizable value of inventory  equipment and supplier purchase commitments associated with the pocketzip segment 
as a result of these continuing product losses  the company discontinued its pocketzip product line during the fourth quarter of as of december   the net assets related to the pocketzip platform were approximately million 
there is no assurance that there will not be additional charges or liabilities as the company exits this product line 
the company had previously entered into various arrangements under which the company purchased certain flash memory and other memory products from other companies and marketed those products under the iomega name 
examples of this strategy included microdrive  compactflash and smartmedia  products all announced since the beginning of the fourth quarter of the company incurred significant losses on these products since their launch and  therefore  decided to discontinue them during the fourth quarter of as of december   there was no net inventory value remaining on these products 
however  there is no assurance that there will not be additional charges or liability as the company exits these products 
with the introduction of several new products such as hipzip part of the pocketzip segment  fotoshow part of other and various software products part of other  the company attempted to expand into new markets and channels such as digital audio players  digital photo storage display and packaged software in which the company did not have significant prior experience 
the company has incurred significant losses on its hipzip and fotoshow products since their launch and  therefore  decided to discontinue them during the fourth quarter of as of december   there was no net inventory value remaining on the hipzip and fotoshow products 
however  there is no assurance that there will not be additional charges or liabilities as the company exits these products 
as stated above  the company has invested significant resources in developing and launching new products including pocketzip  hipzip  fotoshow and microdrive products 
the company was unable to sell these products profitably 
notwithstanding  the company believes that it must continue to develop new product lines while still maintaining a strong focus on its zip product line 
in addition to nas products and new high capacity storage products  as described above  the company expects to review new business opportunities in the areas of software and services 
there is no assurance that any new products or services will achieve profitability  significant market presence or otherwise be successful 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  because the company s expense levels including budgeted selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
the company s future operating results are subject to risks associated with general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
a decrease in consumer spending could have a direct impact on the company s sales 
any disruption in general economic conditions including those caused by acts of war  terrorism or other factors could have an adverse impact on the company s results 
the company believes that economic conditions in the personal computer industry have deteriorated and this downturn has affected the computer resellers  distributors and retailers who sell the company s products 
although the company uses commercially reasonable steps to manage the credit granted to its customers  certain receivable balances from one or more of its customers may become uncollectable 
this event could adversely affect the company s financial results 
for example  during the second  third and fourth quarters of  the company saw deterioration in its accounts receivable agings and collection issues with specific customers contributing to the decision to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts 
there is no assurance that the company won t be required to further increase its allowance for doubtful accounts in the future 
management of the company s inventory levels is very complex 
the company s customers frequently adjust their ordering patterns in response to various factors including perceptions of the company s ability to meet demand  the company s and competitors inventory supply in the retail and distribution channel  timing of new product introductions  seasonal fluctuations  company and customer promotions  the consolidation of customer distribution centers  pricing considerations  and the attractiveness of the company s products compared with competing products 
customers may increase orders during times of shortages  cancel orders if the channel is filled with currently available products  or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
any excess supply could result in price reductions and or inventory write downs  which in turn could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  during the second quarter of  the company recorded inventory reserves of million  loss accruals for related supplier purchase commitments of million and accruals of million were recorded to reflect valuation reserves for inventory in the channel 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded additional inventory reserves of million and contract cancellation costs of million 
there is no assurance that there will not be additional charges related to excess supply in the future 
the company s business includes a significant volume of oem sales 
in an oem business  a high proportion of sales are concentrated among a small number of customers 
although the company believes its relationships with oem customers are generally good  a relatively small number of customers represent a business risk that the loss of one or more accounts could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s customers are generally not obligated to purchase any minimum volume and are generally able to terminate their relationship with the company at will 
the company believes that there is a trend among personal computer oem customers to adopt cd rw drives as a standard product feature and this trend has adversely impacted the company s zip business 
this trend is expected to continue and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in mitigating the adverse impact 
the company believes that in order to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition  it will be necessary to further reduce the manufacturing costs of its products  thus enabling the company to profitably sell its products at lower prices in response to competitive and market factors 
the company is continuing to focus on reducing the manufacturing costs of its products by reducing the cost of parts and components used in the company s products through improved inventory management and product design modifications and by taking advantage of industry wide reductions in costs  increasing manufacturing efficiencies  reducing overhead and burden rates and decreasing defect rates 
the need to further reduce costs is particularly important for the company s oem business  as oem customers are highly price sensitive 
if the lower sales volumes recently reported by the company result in less favorable pricing for components purchased from third parties  the company s ability to reduce manufacturing costs may be adversely affected 
although the company has consolidated its manufacturing operations into its penang  malaysia facility to increase manufacturing efficiencies  this facility is still significantly underutilized  which has an adverse impact on the overhead and burden applied to the company s products 
the company is evaluating various alternatives to resolve this underutilization  including divestment and outsourcing of its manufacturing operations 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to resolve this issue  or that charges relating to the future consolidation of the company s manufacturing facilities will not be required 
the company faces development  manufacturing and demand risks with regard to recently introduced products and future products 
future operating results will also depend on the company s ability to effectively manage obsolescence risks associated with products that are phased out and its success in anticipating and ramping to volume production of new or enhanced products 
the factors described above relating to the company s products are  or will be  relevant to any other products currently sold by the company or new products introduced by the company in the future 
the company has experienced problems and may experience problems in the future  relating to the quality  reliability and or availability of certain of its products 
for example  the company has in the past recalled certain products and experienced manufacturing interruptions due to quality problems 
further  during the month of september  various shipments of the company s products to customers and receipt of products from suppliers were temporarily delayed following september  the company is in the process of outsourcing its european product distribution center and logistics 
in any such complex outsourcing project  delays  disruptions and other problems may occur 
any product availability  delays  disruption  shipping  quality or reliability problems experienced by the company  or claims filed against the company as a result of these problems  could have an adverse effect on the company s sales and net income  result in damage to the company s reputation in the marketplace and subject the company to damage claims from its customers 
in addition  component problems  shortages  quality issues or other factors affecting the supply of the company s products could provide an opportunity for competing products to increase their market share 
future operating results also depend on intellectual property and antitrust matters including the possibility that infringement claims asserted from time to time against the company could result in an injunction against future product shipments  require the company to pay royalties to a third party in order to continue to market and distribute one or more of the company s current or future products and also include the possibility that the company would be required to devote unplanned resources to developing modifications to its products or marketing programs 
the company has experienced difficulty in the past and may experience difficulty in the future  in obtaining a sufficient supply of many key components on a timely and cost effective basis 
also  many components incorporated or used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently available only from single or sole source suppliers or from a limited number of suppliers and are purchased by the company without guaranteed supply arrangements 
the company has entered into an agreement with lite on corporation where lite on has become the provider of substantially all of the company s cd rw drives 
the hard disk components used in the peerless disks are obtained exclusively from ibm 
media used in zip mb and mb disks is obtained exclusively from fuji photo film  certain integrated circuits used in zip drives are obtained exclusively from texas instruments and head stack assemblies hsas used in zip notebook drives are obtained exclusively from sae magnetics 
further  the hsas used in zip drives are considered to be mature technologies 
a supplier of one of the components used to produce the hsas has announced its intention to discontinue manufacturing 
the company is in the process of negotiating an end of life purchase of these components 
other suppliers of components of hsas or other assemblies may discontinue one or more components 
in any such case  the company would similarly attempt to make an end of life purchase on the required component s based on its estimates of all future requirements 
there is no assurance that an end of life purchase would be available 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any estimate of future requirements would be accurate or that the components purchased would not be subsequently lost  become defective or be otherwise damaged 
in summary  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 
the inability to obtain sufficient components and equipment to obtain or develop alternative sources of supply at competitive prices and quality or to avoid manufacturing delays could prevent the company from producing sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy market demand or  in the case of a component purchased exclusively from one supplier  the company could be prevented from producing any quantity of the affected product s until such component becomes available from an alternative source  delay product shipments  increase the company s material or manufacturing costs  cause an imbalance in the inventory levels of certain components and cause the company to modify the design of its products to use a more readily available component  which may result in product performance problems 
any or all of these problems could in turn result in the loss of customers  provide an opportunity for competing products to achieve market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components generally extend at most one to two quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component 
the quantities on the purchase order are based on estimated sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it is difficult to forecast product demand 
any misestimate of demand can result in either insufficient or excess capacity and or purchase commitments 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded charges of million for supplier purchase commitments and million for inventory reserves 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded charges of million for inventory reserves and million for the termination of various contractual agreements 
there is no assurance that the company will not be required to take future charges attributable to forecasting inaccuracies 
the company recorded restructuring and other charges during the second  third and fourth quarters of of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with the following restructuring and other actions to adjust the company s operating structure in accordance with sales expectations  reduce the company s break even point and improve operating cash flow  reduce the company s global workforce in all functional areas during by  persons or approximately from  employees at december   streamline the company s supply chain and logistics strategy  including the closure and outsourcing of the company s distribution facility in north carolina  planned closure in and outsourcing of the company s distribution center and logistics in europe  consolidate labor intensive tasks into malaysia  consolidate the company s operations and facilities  including the relocation of corporate headquarters to san diego  california  and revise the company s product strategy 
there is no assurance that additional restructuring and other actions will not be necessary in for example  although the company has consolidated its manufacturing operations into its  square foot penang  malaysia facility to increase manufacturing efficiencies  this facility is still significantly underutilized 
the company is evaluating various alternatives to resolve this underutilization  including divestment and outsourcing of its manufacturing operations 
the implementation of any of the alternatives being considered could result in additional charges 
although the company has already significantly reduced operational expenses  there is no assurance that these reductions are sustainable 
management expects that these restructuring and other actions will reduce future operational and manufacturing expenses 
management further expects the need to implement additional operational cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to reduce expenses in future periods 
in carrying out these actions  the company is at risk that key personnel and experience may be lost 
the company may experience disruptions of information technology systems and other business operations 
the company may incur legal liability and claims associated with the restructuring and mass layoff 
in consolidating facilities  including outsourcing of functions previously performed at the company s european distribution center  the company may experience disruptions in product shipments 
any disruption could adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s success depends in large part upon the services of a number of key employees and the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in june  werner t 
heid joined the company as president and chief executive officer replacing bruce r 
albertson who resigned as president and chief executive officer in may with this change in the chief executive officer  the company has had several other changes in its senior management team including the hiring of a new chief financial officer  general counsel  executive vice president of operations and research and development  vice president of human resources and facilities and several other officers 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and to maintain continuity and stability within the company s senior management team 
during the third quarter of  the company announced plans to cease manufacturing operations in avranches  france and ceased operations shortly thereafter 
there is no assurance that the company s cessation of manufacturing operations in france will not result in significant additional legal or other costs that have not already been accrued for in the restructuring charges recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning nomai litigation 
significant portions of the company s sales are generated in europe and asia 
the company s existing infrastructure outside of the united states is less mature and developed than in the united states 
consequently  future sales and operating income from these regions are less predictable than in the united states 
the company s international sales transactions are generally denominated in us dollars 
however  beginning in january  the company began invoicing the majority of its european customers in euros 
fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by foreign customers could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
during the third quarter of  the company partially reserved its domestic deferred tax assets and maintained a valuation allowance for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the associated operations have been shut down 
these valuation allowances were recorded in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
at december   net deferred tax assets not covered by valuation allowances was million 
the minimum amount of future taxable income that would have to be generated to realize these net deferred tax assets is approximately million 
as such  as business conditions change  there is the risk that the company may not be able to realize its remaining unreserved net deferred tax assets and may have to increase the valuation allowance for these assets in the future 
the company has substantial balances of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments 
significant portions of these balances are invested in investment grade instruments and securities  including commercial paper and corporate bonds 
the company monitors these investments in accordance with the company s investment policy 
there can be no assurance that adverse events or developments in regard to a corporate or municipal issuer would not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position 
the company has issued stock options that are subject to variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation interpretation 
under variable plan accounting  the company is required to recognize compensation expense in its statement of operations for any increase in the market price of the company s common stock above the market price at july   which was the effective date of interpretation 
this compensation expense must be recorded on a quarterly basis until the option is exercised  forfeited or expires unexercised 
the impact of the new options granted under the exchange program on the company s financial statements will depend on quarterly fluctuations in the company s common stock price and the dates of exercises  forfeitures or cancellations of the new options by employees 
for example  during  approximately  shares were forfeited or cancelled  leaving a balance of approximately  shares subject to variable plan accounting 
depending on these factors  the company could be required to record significant compensation expense during the life of the options  which expire in april moreover  because the precise amount of compensation expense will depend on the market price of the common stock at the end of each quarterly period  the company will not be able to forecast in advance the amount of compensation expense that it will incur in any future period 
factors other than those discussed above that could cause actual events or actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward looking statements include the ability of management to manage an increasingly complex business  transportation issues  product and component pricing  changes in analysts earnings estimates  competition  technological changes and advances  adoption of technology or communications standards affecting the company s products  intellectual property rights  litigation  general economic conditions  changes or slowdowns in overall market demand for personal computer products and other consumer products which utilize the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate risks 
the company did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  should the company need to borrow funds in the future  it would be subject to interest rate risks 
the company is also subject to interest rate risks on its current cash balances 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s interest bearing investments were to change  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million in this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or the company s response to such hypothetical conditions 
the company is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company has international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from the functional currency of the company 
the company attempts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to company policies 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  the company is using forward contracts only to hedge balance sheet exposure 
the contracts are primarily in european currencies  the singapore dollar and the japanese yen 
the contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed three months 
the company has a substantial presence in malaysia 
in september  the ruling party in malaysia fixed the malaysian ringgit to the us dollar 
the company has material amounts of accounts payable denominated in ringgit 
currently  the foreign currency markets are closed to hedging alternatives in ringgit 
when the foreign currency markets re open for the ringgit  the company plans to re evaluate its hedging strategy for ringgit exposure 
when hedging balance sheet exposure  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period as the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company typically enters into its foreign exchange forward contracts a few days before its quarter ends  therefore the change in value in the contracts that must be recognized in the financial statements is  under normal circumstances  immaterial 
the fair value of the company s forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the united states dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would increase or decrease by approximately million at december  however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges  consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts are offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying net assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on income statement translation  sales volume and prices  and on local currency costs of production 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the company s ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the company s analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposure and hedges
