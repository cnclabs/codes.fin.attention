item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate  depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed at item description of business factors that may influence future results 
during  we operated in three reportable segments software consulting and development  energy intelligence solutions and computer hardware sales and we are continuing our business activity in all three segments during software consulting and development sales in our consulting and development services segment declined due to the general downturn in the hi tech economy 
in addition to our continuing efforts to market in our traditional markets  in december we acquired endan  which expanded our service and product offerings to include it  particularly in the markets for billing solutions and healthcare solutions 
this acquisition of endan maximizes economies of scale by increasing our revenue base by over based on revenues without the commensurate increase in staffing 
we therefore expect that this acquisition will serve to improve revenue and profitability in this segment beginning in energy intelligence solutions during  we took some very important steps to establish comverge as an independent entity  including the assembly of a strong  new management team  consisting of a new ceo  cfo  executive vice president and other senior management 
we believe we now have the team in place to increase revenue and to attract the additional capital which this segment will require to execute its plan and fulfill its potential 
we expect revenue for the segment to improve during over the levels achieved in these revenue improvements  if they are in fact achieved  will likely be offset in large part by the significantly higher costs associated with the enhanced management  marketing and administrative infrastructure which has been put into place 
based on our current plans  we do not expect the segment to achieve profitable operations during we intend to finance comverge s activities during the next months from outside investment in comverge 
should comverge not be successful in raising outside funding  it will implement an operating plan by the end of the second quarter of  to reduce comverge s costs and expenses to breakeven cash flow by the end of the third quarter of if implemented  this operating plan would require comverge to curtail its research and development activities  consolidate geographically distant operations  significantly reduce its marketing efforts and reduce general  administrative and marketing salary expenses 
implementing this scaled back operating plan will require us to defer certain of the product development and marketing initiatives  which are currently underway or are planned 
implementing this scaled back operating plan may also result in a loss of essential managerial and other employees and other resources necessary to increase or even maintain our revenues and may not result in breakeven operations 
computer hardware databit s business suffered from the slowdown in the economy  especially since september th  and particularly in the greater new york city metropolitan area  the segment s primary market 
in the first months of  we have seen improvement in the level of sales over that of the last few months of databit s customer mix continues to improve  which allowed us to improve gross profit margin to in as compared to in  partially offsetting the decrease in gross profits due to reduced sales 
despite our success in increasing gross profit margins in the past couple of years  we expect the economic slowdown and increasingly competitive market will cause downward pressure on our gross profit margin in critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to bring to the attention of readers of this report those accounting policies which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions  accounting for debt securities  inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and other long lived assets 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are significant as our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue on the sale of products and software are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
such revenues generally do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our software and consulting development segment derived million of its revenues  representing approximately of consolidated sales in million and and million and in and  respectively  from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
foreign currency transactions we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  we expect our percentage of foreign based revenue to increase in as a result of our acquisition of endan in december under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of foreign currency transactions is dependent upon our management s determination regarding the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
if any subsidiary s functional currency would be deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments on our consolidated balance sheets and as part of comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of operations 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the us dollar  then any gain or loss associated with transactions in the local currency would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have determined that the functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
debt securities debt securities may be classified in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity  are classified as available for sale 
at december   we had million of debt securities all of which were classified as trading 
trading debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized holding gains are included in operations 
since we classify all of our debt securities as trading  our results of operations are subject to possible fluctuation due to volatility of the bond market 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories to establish a new cost basis 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
income taxes we have a history of unprofitable operations from losses incurred in a number of our operations 
these losses generated sizeable state  federal and foreign tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  and million as of december   respectively 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset associated with these nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforwards in relation to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of these net deferred tax assets 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates or foreign rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
goodwill and other long lived assets in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
discussed below after its adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continue to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by march  if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the quarter ended march  impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the quarter ended march  in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  as of december   we had an aggregate of million of goodwill  net of amortization  million of which relates to dsit and most of which was recognized as a result of the acquisition of endan  and million of which relates to our energy intelligence solutions subsidiary  and million of other unamortized identifiable intangible assets 
due to the effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact on us of adopting these new standards  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and  therefore  will depend on future actions initiated by management 
as a result  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions  if any

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for reconciliation to our consolidated financial information 
compared to sales 
sales decreased by to in from million in  due to a decrease in sales in all segments 
sales in the software consulting and development segment decreased by million  or  as a result of the continued downturn in the hi tech economy generally and in the demand for software consulting and development services in particular  as well as a decrease in computer embedded software sales 
sales also decreased in the energy intelligence solutions segment by million  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion in of non recurring sales of component inventory and order backlog purchased as part of the scientific atlanta control systems division million  and sales of a specialized load control product developed for a single customer million 
in our computer hardware segment  sales decreased by million  or  resulting from the slowdown in the economy  especially since september th  and particularly in the greater new york city metropolitan area  which is the primary market for the segment 
our sales in the computer hardware segment decreased by in the second half of to million  from million in the second half of gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million  or of sales  in  from million  or of sales  in this decrease was due to a million  or  decrease in gross profit of our software consulting and development segment and a  or  decrease in gross profit of our energy intelligence solutions segment  partially offset by a  or  increase in gross profit in our computer hardware sales segment 
the decrease in the software consulting and development segment was due to the decrease in sales  particularly the inclusion in of certain highly profitable computer embedded software sales which contributed to the deterioration in gross profit margins from in to in in our energy intelligence solutions segment  the decrease in gross profit was entirely due to the decrease in sales  while gross profit margins improved from in to in  primarily due to the negative impact on gross margin of the inventory component sales in in our computer hardware sales segment  the increase in gross profit was entirely due to the improvement in gross margin from of sales in to in as result of a change in our customer mix 
research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses more than doubled to million in as compared to  in this increase was due to a concentrated effort in the energy intelligence solutions segment to complete the development of and make available to customers a broader set of solutions  while refocusing our existing products 
among the technologies developed are mhz communication capabilities to enhance our dcu load control product  latest generation cdpd technology upgrade for our cdc product and upgrade and enhancement of the control system software for our maingate tm system currently being installed at gulf power 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a increased by to million in  from million in the increase was attributable to a million  or increase in our energy intelligence solutions segment 
the increase in sg a in comverge was attributable to the increased level of marketing and administrative costs  including costs associated with hiring a new ceo  cfo  executive vice president and other senior staff for comverge 
salaries and related costs in comverge increased by million in as compared to  due in large part to these hirings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses primarily due to a non recurring bonus of  paid to the ceo in the first quarter of interest income 
interest income decreased to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the amounts invested  as they were being utilized to finance our operations  as well as the decrease in interest rates over the year 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of  in as compared to a tax expense of  in we establish valuation allowances against virtually all deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
for a detailed analysis of the income tax provision  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
compared to sales 
sales increased by to million in from million in due entirely to higher unit sales 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in sales in the energy intelligence solutions segment  which had its first sales in the second quarter of  and a million  or  increase in computer hardware sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in  from million in  increasing in all segments 
gross profits increased by million and million in the energy intelligence solutions and computer hardware segments  respectively  primarily due to their increased level of sales 
gross profits increased in the consulting and development services segment to in as compared to in this improvement was due primarily to increased highly profitable fixed price embedded hardware software system sales 
r d 
r d decreased in to million from million in  as the development of our company s energy intelligence solutions products mature 
sg a 
sg a increased by to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in marketing and administrative costs related to the energy intelligence solutions segment which increased its level of activity significantly in  as well as increased corporate expenses primarily due to a  bonus to the ceo in the first quarter of gain on sale of division 
in september  we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its cinnetic division which was part of the consulting and development services segment for a total of million resulting in a gain of million 
cinnetic had operating losses of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
operating loss 
operating losses decreased by to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the gain from the sale of cinnetic in  as well as the increase in gross profits and decreases in r d  partially offset by the increase in sg a 
interest income and interest expense 
the increase in interest income to million in from  in was due to the interest income on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of our tower semiconductor investment in january the decrease in interest expense from in from was due primarily to the charge in of  for the beneficial conversion feature of debentures which we issued in october income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  in from  in the tax expense is comprised primarily of foreign taxes 
we establish valuation allowances against virtually all deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
the increase in the valuation allowance was the primary reason for our recording a tax expense that resulted in the effective income tax rate in of rather than the us federal statutory rate 
for a detailed analysis of the income tax provision  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
losses from discontinued operations 
the loss in was comprised of equity losses from our investment in tower semiconductor  which was sold in january losses in included equity losses of million and income taxes of million 
these taxes represent israeli taxes associated with the anticipated repatriation of earnings from our israeli subsidiary that held our investment in tower semiconductor 
prior to the signing of a definitive sale agreement in december  earnings of this israeli subsidiary had been considered permanently invested and  accordingly  no income taxes were provided on such earnings 
gain from sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes 
the gain  net of taxes  is from the sale of our tower semiconductor investment 
extraordinary item 
a portion of our convertible debentures was redeemed prior to maturity giving rise to an extraordinary loss of  in addition  we recognized an additional extraordinary loss of  in connection with its refinancing of its short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources we have had a history of operating losses in  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we do not expect to be profitable in the first half of additionally  we are uncertain whether we will achieve profitability in the second half of as of december  we had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and debt security investments 
in addition we had a long term deposit of million securing comverge s long term bank debt of the same amount which remains pledged to the bank 
net cash used in operating activities in was million 
the cash used was primarily for the operations of our comverge subsidiary million and us operations  primarily corporate activities million 
dsit  however  had breakeven cash flow for the cash used in financing and investment activities in included million in connection with the endan acquisition by dsit as well as  for the purchase of shares of our common stock 
we have no current plans to invest cash for these purposes during and during  we reached agreement with our bank to extend the maturity of our million term loan to february the loan is secured by a dssi guarantee and the pledge of a million bank deposit 
as of december   dsit was utilizing million of its then million line of credit 
dsit is in the process of restructuring its bank financing and in march replaced a portion of its line of credit with a long term loan 
the long term loan for approximately  is denominated in nis  payable over five years and bears interest at per annum 
as part of the restructuring  dsit s line of credit was reduced to approximately million  denominated in nis and bearing an average interest rate of the israeli prime rate plus per annum 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
we intend to finance the activities of dsit during the next months from cash flow from operations 
we believe that the recent acquisition by dsit will assist in not only increasing profitability but also cash generated from these activities 
we do not expect to utilize cash flow from dsit to finance our us based activities due to israeli withholding taxes  as well as the fact that our ownership was reduced to as a result of the endan acquisition 
we intend to finance our us based operating activities and our corporate activities from cash on hand and from operating cash flow from the computer hardware segment 
based on its current business plan  we do not have sufficient liquidity to finance the operations of our energy intelligence solutions segment for the months following the date of this report 
we intend to finance these activities during from outside investment 
we believe that comverge is in a position now where it can seek outside capital and its management has taken substantial steps in its effort to secure sufficient financing to fund its activities 
however  there is no assurance that comverge will be able to raise capital or raise an amount sufficient to meet the needs of its business plan 
should comverge not be successful in raising outside funding  it will implement an operating plan by the end of the second quarter of  to reduce costs  so that it will have breakeven cash flow by the end of the third quarter of such an operating plan will include curtailing research and development expenses  consolidating geographically distant operations  significantly reducing marketing efforts and reducing general administrative and marketing salary expenses 
the reduction in costs  however  may leave us without essential employees and other resources necessary to increase revenues  may not result in operations with breakeven cash flow and may end up reducing our revenues 
we believe that should we be successful in implementing the foregoing measures we will have adequate liquidity to finance our operating activities and corporate expenses for the months following the date of this report 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations and commitments at december  principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness  future minimum operating lease obligations and contractual obligations to our ceo for payments for his post retirement consulting services to us are as set forth in the table below 
cash payments due during year ending december  in thousands contractual obligations total after long term debt related to us operations   long term debt related to israeli operations operating leases     consulting agreement with ceo   total contractual cash obligations      we expect to finance these contractual commitments from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we also have obligations under various agreements and other arrangements with officers and other employees with respect to severance arrangements and multiyear employment agreements 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment in certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   dsit had total of million in potential severance obligations  of which approximately million was funded and approximately was unfunded 
under the terms of his employment agreement with us  we have an obligation to pay our chief executive officer consulting fees over a seven year period upon his retirement on december  although we contemplate that those payments will begin on january   our ceo has the option to terminate his employment agreement and begin his consulting period on or prior to december  during the first four years of the consulting period  we would have to pay our ceo of his salary in effect at the time of termination and of that salary during the last three years of the consulting period  plus contributions to a non qualified defined contribution retirement plan equal to of the consulting fee 
at the start of the consulting period  we are also required to fund amounts payable for the term of the consulting period  by the purchase of an annuity or similar investment product 
the ceo s salary for is  per annum 
we also have severance arrangements under an employment agreement with our chief financial officer to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if our cfo employment agreement is terminated by us or by him for reasons other than for cause  we must pay him i an amount equal to of his last month s salary multiplied by the number of years including partial years that the cfo worked for us  plus ii an amount equal to five times his last month s salary or two times such salary if the cfo terminates the employment agreement other than after a change in control or a breach by us of his employment agreement 
our severance obligation would be reduced by the amount contributed by us to certain israeli pension and severance funds pursuant to the cfo s employment agreement 
as of december   the unfunded portion of such severance obligation was our energy intelligence solutions subsidiary may in certain circumstances be liable to make severance payments to its ceo and its executive vice president 
under the employment agreement with the ceo of the subsidiary if his employment is terminated without cause  the subsidiary would have to pay the subsidiary ceo one year of base salary  or if there has been an ipo for the subsidiary  three years of base salary plus up to of any excess parachute payment  plus  if such termination is before december   his base salary through december the subsidiary ceo s salary for is  per annum 
under our employment agreement with the executive vice president of our utility solutions segment  if such officer s employment agreement were terminated without cause  the subsidiary would have to pay to such officer three months of base salary  during for each year or partial year of service to the subsidiary up to a maximum of one year of salary 
the executive vice president s employment commenced in march our energy intelligence solutions subsidiary is not obligated to make any severance payments under these agreements if the ceo or the executive vice president voluntary terminates his employment agreement 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations a majority of our sales are denominated in dollars 
the remaining portion is primarily denominated in nis  linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed  through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of our expenses in israel are in nis  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar  should it be significantly different from the rate of inflation 
in the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was  whereas in the nis appreciated against the dollar by 
inflation in israel was and during these same periods  respectively 
during the first two months of  the nis was further devalued against the dollar by and inflation during this period was 
as of december   virtually all of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis  and the net amount of such monetary assets and liabilities was not material 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
payments to related parties we paid an individual as a director and vice president  who is the son of our chief executive officer  approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we also have engaged certain of our directors to render professional services to us 
one or our directors is principal of a law firm that we engage to perform legal services for us 
we paid to this firm legal fees and out of pocket disbursements which includes fees and expenses of special counsel hired on our behalf of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also engaged an asset management firm that is controlled by one of our directors 
this firm provides discretionary asset management services to us 
in the year ended december   we paid fees of  to this asset management firm 
at december   this asset management firm administered approximately million of our assets  including million of our debt securities 
management believes that the terms of each of the above transactions were on substantially the same terms as would be reached in a transaction with an unrelated third party

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our financial instruments  including derivatives  if any 
a financial instrument is defined as cash  evidence of an ownership interest in an entity  or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual obligation either to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument to or from a second entity 
examples of financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  loans  investments  trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  options and forward contracts 
the disclosures below include  among other matters  the nature and terms of derivative transactions  information about significant concentrations of credit risk  and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
in march  we retained malley associates capital management  an asset management firm that is controlled by one of our directors  to provide discretionary asset management services to us  currently with respect to million of our funds 
malley associates may invest our funds in fixed income government and corporate securities  money market mutual funds  short term money market instruments and equity securities 
malley associates has complete discretion and authority to invest our funds in these accounts without prior consultation with us 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values due to their short holding periods and stable market interest rates 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt and deposits with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the fair value of our long term debt and long term deposits are not materially different from their carrying amounts 
the fair value of investments is estimated based on market value 
the estimation of fair value of our investments book value of  at december  was not practicable  although we believe that the estimated fair values of such investments are not materially different from their book value 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term bank deposits  asset backed securities and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a majority of our cash equivalent deposits as well as our short and long term bank deposits is a major financial institution of high credit standing 
the counterparties to our asset backed securities consist of various major corporations of high credit standing 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable were due from a us customer that pays its trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the our customer base
