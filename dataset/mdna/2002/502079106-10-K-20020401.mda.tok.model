the majority of the purchase price was funded by a term loan for million issued by the company s primary lender

the company purchased  shares of treasury stock for million in critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following significant accounting policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on the financial statements either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate or because they involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable reserve the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including historical trends and industry and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
the company s evaluation also includes reserves for billing adjustments  pricing changes  and disputes 
if circumstances change ie  an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to a single customer in the aerospace industry 
if this customer experiences significant adverse conditions in its industry or operations  including the continued impact of the current downturn in demand for aerospace products  the customer may not be able to meet its ongoing financial obligations to the company for prior sales or purchase additional products under the terms of existing contracts 
inventory the company is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements 
in the aviation industry  these future demand requirements depend on estimates of aircraft lives and the need for spare parts over the course of the aircraft life 
additionally  the company has recorded charges in recent periods due to discontinuances of product lines or losses of customer contracts 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if there are significant changes in the company s products or customers  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is currently amortized on the straight line method over its estimated useful life  ranging from to years 
goodwill is currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  the company must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges of these assets not previously recorded 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the fasb issued sfas no 
in june sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and a review  at least annually  for impairment 
the company plans to adopt this pronouncement effective january  at such time  amortization associated with purchased goodwill will cease 
during  goodwill amortization totaled approximately million 
the company has not finalized the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and as such  has not determined what the effect of these tests will be on its earnings and financial position 
item a
