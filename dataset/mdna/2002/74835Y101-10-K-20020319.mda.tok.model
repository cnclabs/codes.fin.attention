when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development  acquisition  and marketing of acute care and critical care hospital specialty pharmaceutical and related healthcare products 
we currently market four products through our internal sales force in the us we expect to launch a fifth product in the us in the first half of  and we market a sixth product in italy through a strategic partner 
our current products target pediatric neurologists  gastroenterologists  nephrologists  transplant centers and nuclear medicine centers 
on november   questcor  formerly cypros pharmaceutical corporation  completed a merger with ribogene  inc ribogene and subsequently changed its name to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of ribogene common stock was exchanged for shares of our common stock and each outstanding share of ribogene series a preferred stock was converted into shares of our series a preferred stock 
in conjunction with the november acquisition of ribogene  we changed our fiscal year end from july to december since the completion of the merger  we have focused our resources on i acquiring new products  ii increasing the sales of our existing products  and iii out licensing and partnering our research and development stage products 
during  we completed our transition from operating as essentially two independent companies to emerge as a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the sales and marketing of our branded products 
we currently market four products in the us hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that helps patients with infantile spasm  or west syndrome  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat esophageal varices that have recently bled  and glofil tm and inulin in sodium chloride  which are both injectable agents that assess kidney function by measuring glomerular filtration rate 
additionally  we earn royalties from our strategic partner  crinos industria farmacobiologica spa crinos  on sales in italy of pramidin  an intranasal form of metoclopramide for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders 
we recently acquired the us rights to market vsl tm  a patented probiotic 
we intend to market vsl tm as a dietary supplement  to promote normal gastrointestinal function 
we intend to begin sales of vsl tm in the first half of consistent with our efforts to focus on sales and marketing  we have reduced spending on research and development 
accordingly  we have entered into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain technology acquired from ribogene 
in january  we signed a revised letter of understanding with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals fabre kramer  which anticipates a license agreement whereby fabre kramer will manage and provide funding for the clinical development programs for hypnostat tm an intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat tm  an intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
our antifungal drug discovery program has been partnered with tularik  inc  of south san francisco  ca  our antiviral drug discovery program has been partnered with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc of south san francisco  ca  and our antibacterial program has been partnered with dainippon pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
of osaka  japan 
during  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of common stock for million to sigma tau finance holding sa and certain 
table of contents affiliates of sigma tau sigma tau 
on december   we received million   for the purchase of  shares of common stock at per share  and  for the purchase of the above mentioned warrant to purchase an additional  shares of common stock from the principal stockholders of sigma tau 
we issued the common stock for the december transaction in february additionally  we entered into an agreement with sigma tau and its affiliates to limit sigma tau s purchases of our common stock on the open market to  shares through july based on the purchases sigma tau has made directly from us and information provided to the securities and exchange commission the sec  sigma tau and their affiliates own approximately of our outstanding voting stock as of december  assuming sigma tau exercises its warrant in full  they would own approximately including the  shares of common stock issued in february of our outstanding common stock as of december  on march   in two separate transactions  we issued million of convertible debentures to an institutional investor and sigma tau 
we will pay interest on the debentures at a rate of per annum on a quarterly basis 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share subject to adjustment for stock splits and reclassifications 
at the end of the term of the debenture  under certain circumstances  we have the option to repay the principal in stock and  under certain circumstances  we can also redeem the debenture for cash prior to maturity 
the debentures mature on march  in conjunction with this transaction  we issued warrants to both the institutional investor and sigma tau to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
both warrants expire on march  assuming the conversion and exercise of the above mentioned debenture and warrant by sigma tau and assuming the exercise of all other outstanding warrants held by sigma tau  sigma tau would own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as of december   we had million of cash on hand 
on january   we paid our outstanding million note and reduced our cash balance accordingly 
based on our internal forecasts and projections  we believe that our cash on hand at december   together with the million of cash raised through the issuance of the above mentioned convertible debentures and the cash to be generated through the expected sale of our products  will be sufficient to fund operations through december  we have rights to the following registered trademarks hp acthar gel and ethamolin 
we also have the following unregistered trademarks glofil tm  migrastat tm  emitasol tm  hypnostat tm  panistat tm  ceresine tm  cordox tm  dermaflo tm  neoflo tm  and sildaflo tm 
vsl tm is owned by vsl pharmaceuticals  inc pramidin is owned by crinos industria farmacobiologica spa 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
strategy our overall objective is to acquire and market acute care and critical care hospital specialty pharmaceutical and related healthcare products 
our strategy includes acquiring marketed or near to market products that complement existing products and  where appropriate  forming corporate alliances to facilitate and fund the clinical development of our drug candidates 
our operating objectives include building a strong hospital specialty market oriented sales  marketing and distribution capability to increase and support sales of our products currently being marketed as well as new complementary products which we may acquire in the future  acquiring marketed products to leverage our existing sales  marketing and distribution infrastructure  and building a sustainable cash flow by reducing our overall cash consumption or burn rate 
consistent with our strategy  we acquired acthar from aventis pharmaceuticals inc aventis  in july we began commercial shipment of questcor labeled acthar to drug wholesalers in september for the year ended december   we had million in revenues from acthar 
we also acquired the rights to market vsl  a patented probiotic  from vsl pharmaceuticals  inc vsl  in december vsl is owned in part by the principal shareholders of sigma tau 
we expect to launch vsl in the first half of 
table of contents acquisition of approved pharmaceutical products for promotion by sales force we have built a sales  marketing  and distribution capability that is adequate to support and increase our sales of currently marketed products 
we are looking to acquire additional hospital specialty based products currently on the market  that are available to be licensed or purchased 
products to be considered for acquisition would have to be complementary to our existing products  synergistic with promotional efforts currently being undertaken by our sales force  and contribute to our gross margins 
there is no assurance we will be able to acquire such products or that  if acquired  they will be profitable 
as of december   we had a group of sales and marketing professionals to sell and promote our products in the hospital specialty market 
strategic alliances and corporate partnering an important part of our strategy includes the development of strategic alliances for out licensing our currently marketed products to other world markets and the corporate partnering of our drug candidates in various stages of clinical development 
through agreements with other companies  we have acquired five marketed products acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl to expand the sales of emitasol marketed as pramidin in italy worldwide  we have entered into marketing and distribution agreements with the following company headquarters territory crinos industria farmacobiologica spa como  italy italy csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh vienna  austria austria  poland  the czech republic  bulgaria  russia  hungary  the slovak republic  romania  and the remaining community of independent states ahn gook pharmaceuticals seoul  south korea south korea laboratorios silesia sa santiago  chile chile we have received some upfront payments and  in certain cases  may receive milestone payments if our partners receive approval to market products in their territories 
to date  pramidin is only marketed in italy 
we receive royalties on sales of pramidin by crinos industria farmacobiologica spa crinos 
royalty revenue has not been significant and we do not believe royalty revenue will increase in the future 
csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh csc  has received approval to market pramidin in poland and the czech republic  but it has not begun to market the product 
when and if csc decides to begin selling pramidin in these territories  we do not believe the royalty revenue will be significant 
consistent with our objective of de emphasizing our research and development stage projects  we have entered into various agreements to out license certain anti infective drug discovery programs as follows company headquarters project dainippon pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
osaka  japan antibacterial drug discovery tularik  inc south san francisco  ca antifungal drug discovery rigel pharmaceuticals  inc south san francisco  ca antiviral drug discovery we received some upfront payments for these programs and will receive milestone and royalty payments if the compounds covered by these agreements advance through clinical development and eventually into sales 
although we retain some information rights to these programs  we do not control their progress 
we have discontinued research and development on all remaining anti infective programs 
we retain certain patents and other intellectual property on these and other drug discovery programs 
we are required to pay certain legal fees and patent expenses in order to maintain ownership of this intellectual property 
legal fees and patent expenses may be significant and there can be no assurance that we will ever recognize any value from these expenditures 
we may seek to out license some or all of our intellectual property in this area or a 
table of contents selection of compounds for development and resultant potential milestones 
additionally  royalty payments from these agreements may not be received for several years  if ever 
there can be no assurance that compounds covered by these agreements will ever advance through to commercialization or that we will ever receive any future payments under these agreements 
we intend to out license to appropriate partners in certain geographic areas the marketing and distribution rights to emitasol intranasal metoclopramide for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including delayed onset emesis 
in july  the exclusive option to develop and market emitasol in north america  held by shire pharmaceuticals group plc  had expired 
we intend to seek a corporate partner to continue the development of emitasol in north america 
until such corporate partner is found  we do not expect to incur any significant expense related to the development of emitasol in north america except legal fees  patent expenses and minimum royalty payments 
we currently have four licensing agreements for the marketing of emitasol in the following territories italy  austria  poland  czech republic  russia  hungary  slovak republic  south korea and chile 
it is our goal to enter into more licensing agreements in the future in other countries 
marketed pharmaceutical and related healthcare products our marketed products as of december  include acthar  which was acquired in july  ethamolin  which was acquired in november  and glofil and inulin  which were acquired in august we intend to begin marketing vsl during the first half of acthar 
in july  we signed an agreement with aventis to acquire the worldwide rights to acthar 
acthar is a corticotropin product that had previously been made available to patients as part of a special program administered by the national organization for rare disorders nord  to treat seriously ill children with a seizure complex  referred to as infantile spasm  or west syndrome  a potentially fatal disorder  and patients with multiple sclerosis who experience severe and painful episodes of flare 
due to limited production of acthar and the resulting limited availability of the product over the past few years  distribution had been tightly controlled by aventis through the nord limited access program 
under this program approximately  vials of acthar were made available to patients in following the acquisition of acthar in july  we began shipping the product to drug wholesalers at the end of the third quarter 
we are able to support general market distribution since acthar is now back in full production 
as part of our agreement  aventis has agreed to manufacture and supply acthar through july at a fixed price per vial 
a formal manufacturing agreement has not yet been executed 
failure to complete this manufacturing agreement may adversely affect our ability to obtain an adequate supply of acthar  which in turn would impact future revenues 
we are in the process of securing a new manufacturer for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api in acthar and also the production of the finished product 
we have identified several potential third party contract manufacturers for the api and finished product 
we believe that existing supplies of the api  coupled with our existing relationship with aventis  should ensure adequate supply of acthar through based on our internal sales forecast 
however  there can be no assurance that the existing inventory of the api will be sufficient to meet our demand beyond  or that we will be able to enter into agreements with third party manufacturers to supply acthar  or if these agreements are entered into that the third party manufacturers will be able to supply acthar 
additionally  under our current arrangement  aventis has agreed to supply acthar at a fixed price per vial through july there can be no assurance  even if we are able to secure an adequate supply of the api and enter into an agreement for the production of the finished product  that the cost of the api and the finished product will not increase substantially 
based on information received by us from nord and the previous distributor of acthar  we estimate that approximately  patients annually were allowed access to acthar over the past four years of the aventis limited access program 
we believe  through internal forecasts  that the re introduction of acthar into normal distribution channels could open access to more patients suffering from various autoimmune disorders who may be helped by acthar 
through nord  we maintain a program to provide vials of acthar free of 
table of contents charge to patients who cannot otherwise afford the drug 
during the fourth quarter of  we estimate approximately patients were referred to the free access program 
ethamolin 
end stage liver disease  also known as hepatic cirrhosis  results in approximately  deaths annually 
hepatic cirrhosis promotes the formation of esophageal varices through development of portal hypertension 
when portal venous blood pressure rises  the varicosities that develop may cause life threatening upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and are associated with a high mortality rate 
at least  patients in the us have either actively bleeding esophageal varices or esophageal varices that are at imminent risk of bleeding 
early and effective treatment of esophageal varices to achieve hemostasis is essential to a favorable outcome in a bleeding patient 
the most common pharmaceutical treatment protocol involves the injection of a sclerosing agent into the varix  achieving clot formation and obliteration of the varix 
this form of hemostasis is called sclerotherapy and usually requires multiple treatment sessions 
ethamolin is the only sclerotherapy agent approved by the food and drug administration fda for the treatment of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
there is strong competition from band ligation  a form of surgery  but we believe that ethamolin is the only sclerosant that is actively promoted at this time 
we estimate ethamolin to have on a ml basis  of the total sclerosant market share  at this time 
glofil and inulin 
kidney disease afflicts more than million persons in the us and is increasing primarily due to an increase in diabetes mellitus  hypertension and glomerulonephritis cases 
kidney disease results in over billion annually in healthcare costs in the us the market includes  persons with severe kidney diseases   persons receiving kidney transplants annually  and an additional  persons awaiting kidney transplants 
the measurement of kidney function  glomerular filtration rate or gfr is critical to the understanding of the disease state and its appropriate therapeutic intervention 
gfr has historically been estimated by the measurement of endogenous serum creatinine and by creatinine clearance 
these diagnostic assays may overestimate kidney function by as much as in some patients 
we believe that the use of renal filtration markers  such as glofil or inulin  offer a more accurate and direct means of determining gfr  and thereby result in better clinical decision making 
glofil and inulin are fda approved products for the measurement of gfr 
nephrology  transplant  oncology and nuclear medicine departments at major medical centers are the primary users of these products 
glofil is an injectable radioactive diagnostic agent  which provides rapid information on gfr with great accuracy 
inulin is a non radioactive injectable diagnostic agent  which provides a measure of gfr 
we believe that there is an opportunity for increased utilization of glofil present diagnostic procedures for measuring kidney function include serum creatinine and creatinine clearance tests 
these two tests are the most commonly performed methods of measuring kidney function because of their low cost  however  both methods may significantly overestimate kidney function in the estimated  patients with severe renal disease 
the utility of glofil has been established in published clinical studies as being a more direct  accurate measure of kidney function  yielding much more reliable results than serum creatinine or creatinine clearance tests 
this improved accuracy can be essential in monitoring disease progression  and implementing appropriate interventions and assessing the degree of success of kidney grafts post transplant 
we believe that as new interventional therapies emerge  such as the use of ace inhibitors to slow down disease progression and the modification of diet in renal disease mdrd  for the treatment of early stage renal disease  the use of glofil will take on much greater importance  however  at this point  most early stage patients are not felt to require this degree of accuracy in the determination of renal function 
glofil has also been used in clinical trials administered by the national institutes of health nih 
use of glofil in clinical trials can provide the trial administrators an accurate measure of kidney function and show the effects of the drug being studied on normal kidney function 
glofil has been included in several recent clinical trials administered by the nih 
one of these trials ended in the third quarter of we plan to promote the use of glofil to the nih and to large pharmaceutical companies for use in clinical trials as a means of detecting kidney toxicity and measuring overall kidney function 
although we believe that glofil may be used in clinical trials in the future  there can be no assurance that 
table of contents glofil will be included in any clinical protocol or  if it is included  that we will receive significant revenues from the future sales of glofil the biggest impediment to the growth in the sales of glofil is the lack of availability of the test to practicing clinicians 
routine testing with glofil requires dedicated laboratory facilities and trained technicians 
our promotional efforts are focused on establishing testing sites in all major market areas in the us we are not aware of any new diagnostic agents that would pose a competitive threat to glofil inulin  which is also sold by us  is an alternative agent for gfr measurement 
however  the preparation and use of inulin is time consuming and it does not provide the practical advantages of glofil the use of and demand for inulin is relatively limited 
we do not expect revenues from the sale of inulin to increase in the future 
vsl we have acquired the us marketing rights for vsl  a patented probiotic preparation of eight live freeze dried lactic acid bacterial species 
probiotics are living organisms in foods and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
we intend to market vsl in the first half of  as a dietary supplement to promote normal gi function 
vsl is also being studied for use as a biological product to treat a number of inflammatory bowel diseases ibds 
ibd is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal illnesses and consists mainly of two conditions ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease 
it is estimated that almost one million americans have ibd  with roughly due to ulcerative colitis and due to crohn s disease 
about of ulcerative colitis patients eventually must have their colon removed because of massive bleeding  severe illness  rupture of the colon  or risk of cancer 
a number of surgeries may be performed for ulcerative colitis 
one such procedure  which is becoming increasingly common for ulcerative colitis  is ileal pouch anal anastomosis ipaa surgery 
this operation allows the patient to have relatively normal bowel movements because it preserves part of the rectum 
the major long term complication that occurs as a result of this surgery is pouchitis 
pouchitis is the non specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir that appears to be associated with bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis 
studies have found that probiotics are effective in preventing flare ups of chronic pouchitis 
in a specific study regarding chronic pouchitis  conducted by gionchetti  et al  and discussed in the us peer reviewed clinical journal of gastroenterology and hepatology   vsl has been effective in preventing chronic pouchitis 
in this study  the efficacy of vsl was compared with a placebo in patients who had undergone the ipaa surgical procedure and had achieved clinical and endoscopic remission from chronic pouchitis after antibiotic treatment 
of the patients who received the placebo  all had a relapse of pouchitis during the nine month study period 
of the patients that received vsl  were still in remission at nine months post treatment 
no side effects were observed from the treatment with vsl vsl has received orphan drug designation from the office of orphan products development at fda for two indications the treatment of active chronic pouchitis  and the prevention of disease relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis 
orphan drug designation applies to diseases and disease states with a prevalence of less than  patients in the us orphan drug designation confers certain protection such as market exclusivity for seven years once the product has been approved 
for vsl and us to take advantage of this designation  vsl would have to be approved as a new biological product by the fda 
the process to file for approval would require additional clinical trial work as well as a significant amount of manufacturing validation 
this could take years and may cost several hundred thousands of dollars to complete 
we do not control the clinical development strategy for vsl there can be no assurance that vsl will be studied in additional clinical trials or that it will ever enjoy the benefits of this orphan drug designation 
we believe the emerging role for probiotics in the management of patients with ibd offers an attractive market opportunity for vsl while at the same time effectively complements the current promotion of ethamolin to this same group of gastroenterologists 

table of contents discontinued product line neoflo in november  we acquired the dermaflo technology  a patented topical drug delivery system  from enquay  inc for a combination of cash and royalties on net sales 
the technology is a polymer matrix system that can store a variety of different drugs and release them at a desired rate over an extended period of time so that optimal clinical response is obtained 
included in the assets acquired were the products neoflo  a triple antibiotic over the counter wound care product  and sildaflo  a potential prescription burn care product  and required manufacturing equipment 
we had a multi year agreement with nutramax products  inc nutramax  a leading supplier of first aid and wound care products  under which we were supplying neoflo  a proprietary triple antibiotic product using the dermaflo technology  to nutramax for conversion and sale in the form of adhesive strips and patches 
nutramax had the exclusive right to sell the finished products to the retail and industrial first aid markets 
further  the agreement called for us and nutramax to jointly develop several new products using the dermaflo technology and to share the development expense and profits from future sales 
we began shipping the product to nutramax in march in may  nutramax filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the nutramax bankruptcy filing had a negative impact on our sales and cash flow during calendar year and first quarter of approximately  of our sales to nutramax was included in the unsecured creditors class and was subject to a reduced payment 
of this amount  only  was recovered 
in february  nutramax s plan of reorganization was approved by the bankruptcy court 
when nutramax emerged from chapter  nutramax further reduced its forecast for adhesive strips to be supplied 
on april   nutramax filed a motion with the us bankruptcy court to reject our supply agreement effective on that date 
the nutramax product was manufactured in our facility in lee s summit  missouri 
since the dermaflo business is not strategically important to us and since the investment needed to build the business into a profitable venture is substantial  in may we ceased our manufacturing operations at lee s summit after completion of the remaining orders for nutramax 
in may  we closed our lee s summit facilities and discontinued any work using the dermaflo technology 
during the remainder of  we had been in discussion with franklin pharmaceuticals inc franklin  an entity owned by a former employee who ran the lee s summit facility 
we had an agreement in principle with franklin to acquire the rights to the dermaflo technology and to sublease the lee s summit facility and the equipment necessary to manufacture products using the dermaflo technology 
in november  in order to avoid the payment of minimum royalties owed to enquay under the original license agreement  questcor and enquay assigned all dermaflo drug technology to franklin 
through the end of  we continued to negotiate with franklin as to the sublease of the facility and the rental of the manufacturing equipment 
since franklin was unable to secure adequate financing to fund its operations  we did not enter into the sublease and the equipment rental agreement 
in december  we determined that the probability of recognizing any future value for the lee s summit facility  the related leasehold improvements  and the manufacturing equipment was minimal 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of  as a loss on the discontinued product line consisting of a write off of the remaining net book value of leasehold improvements  a write down of the manufacturing equipment to its estimated fair market value and the total estimated remaining lease payments remaining on the lee s summit facility 
we continue to discuss the possibility of subleasing the facility and rental of the manufacturing equipment with interested parties 
in february  enquay notified franklin that it was terminating the dermaflo license assigned by us in november unless franklin was able to obtain adequate funding 
to date  we cannot determine if franklin has obtained adequate funding or if they still have any rights to the dermaflo technology under the assigned license 
it is our intention to try and sublease the lee s summit facility and to sell the manufacturing equipment located in that facility 
the market for specialized clean room space in lee s summit is nearly non existent and it is highly unlikely that we will be successful in entering into a sublease in the near future or ever 
accordingly  it appears we will continue to pay the monthly rent on this facility through december although certain equipment contained in the lee s summit facility had recently undergone extensive refurbishment  the equipment is highly specialized and must be recalibrated and 
table of contents revalidated if it is moved 
we have made the equipment available for sale but it is highly unlikely that we will be able to sell this equipment in the near future  if ever 
with the exception of the monthly rental and related facilities charges  we do not anticipate any additional significant cash outlay as a result of our decision to discontinue this product line 
drug development our development programs include the intranasal drugs emitasol  hypnostat  and panistat and the cytoprotective compound ceresine dichloroacetate or dca 
intranasal drugs emitasol through our merger with ribogene  inc  we acquired emitasol  an intranasal form of metoclopramide 
metoclopramide is an approved antiemetic and is available in both oral and intravenous forms to treat diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
we  through future strategic partners  may choose to investigate emitasol for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 
emitasol is currently being developed and marketed in certain countries throughout the world through corporate partners 
it is on the market in italy as pramidin  and is licensed to and distributed by crinos in italy for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
for the year ended december   crinos distributed approximately  units of pramidin in italy 
we entered into a marketing agreement in december with ahn gook pharmaceuticals ahn gook  for intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook also signed an agreement with crinos to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide finished product 
this product is sold as pramidin in italy 
emitasol has been filed for approval in korea  and if approved  will be distributed by ahn gook in korea for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
in the us  emitasol is proposed as a method to control diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent delayed onset emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy 
currently  there are no drugs specifically approved to treat delayed onset emesis 
we believe that emitasol  when given intranasally  may be effective in preventing delayed onset emesis 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  and cost effectiveness 
diabetic gastroparesis 
questcor  together with its former north american collaborative partner shire pharmaceuticals group plc shire  see strategic alliances and collaborations  concluded a us phase ii clinical trial in diabetic gastroparesis in the fourth quarter of for some diabetics  proper digestion may be difficult 
variable blood glucose levels may lead to a condition known as gastroparesis or stomach paralysis 
gastroparesis can result in general loss of appetite  nausea and vomiting  and in some cases severe dehydration 
many prescription medications are used to treat gastroparesis  including bethanchol and erythromycin 
each of these prescription drugs has limited effectiveness and contain side effects 
metoclopramide is approved for treating gastroparesis 
we believe that the intranasal form of metoclopramide may provide diabetics who have gastroparesis with an easier route of administration  resulting in better patient compliance 
in october  we announced the results of the phase ii study of emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis 
the study showed that both emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray and oral metoclopramide were bioavailable when administered to diabetic gastroparesis patients 
the trial also suggested that emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray treatment may enhance the clinical response versus oral metoclopramide 
in july  shire s exclusive option to develop and market emitasol in north america expired and all rights were returned to us 
we currently intend to seek a corporate partner for the development of emitasol in the us and in other countries around the world 
delayed onset emesis 
according to the american cancer society  about million new patients are diagnosed with cancer in the us each year  many of whom are treated with chemotherapy 
nausea and vomiting emesis are common side effects of cancer chemotherapy 
chemotherapy induced emesis is considered to occur in two phases acute within hours of the initiation of chemotherapy and delayed on the second and subsequent days 
several drugs have been approved by the fda for preventing nausea and 
table of contents vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy  including injectable forms of ondansetron  granisetron and metoclopramide 
ondansetron and granisetron are representatives of a newer class of drugs called serotonin antagonists or setrons  and are considered highly effective in controlling acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
there are conflicting reports  however  about the efficacy of serotonin antagonists in controlling delayed onset emesis 
there are  in fact  no fda approved treatments specifically for delayed onset emesis 
increasing numbers of these patients are being treated as outpatients and experience delayed onset emesis when they are no longer under the immediate care of a medical professional 
any medication for such emetic episodes should therefore be suitable for self administration by the patient 
injectable medications are unlikely to be suitable in this context 
it appears that current practice is to provide patients initially with oral antiemetics in tablet form 
tablets are not  however  particularly suitable for patients who are nauseated and may vomit 
prior clinical trials for emitasol have demonstrated that metoclopramide is absorbed and effective when given intranasally 
phase i trials indicated that the overall amount of metoclopramide which reaches the plasma is very similar whether the drug is given intranasally  intravenously or orally 
given the similarity in uptake of the three dosage forms  similarity might also be expected in their clinical performance 
for acute emesis  the expected similarity in performance has been demonstrated for the intranasal and intravenous dosage forms 
in a prior phase iii study  emitasol provided protection against acute emesis comparable to that previously reported for intravenous metoclopramide 
we therefore anticipate that intranasal metoclopramide may be effective for controlling delayed onset emesis  an activity suggested for oral metoclopramide in the clinical literature 
regardless of which indication is selected for emitasol  substantial additional development  clinical testing potentially including one or more phase iii trials and investment will be required prior to seeking regulatory approval for commercialization of this product in the us there can be no assurance that a phase iii clinical trial of emitasol will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  or at all 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of emitasol could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
hypnostat through our merger with ribogene  we acquired hypnostat  an intranasal form of triazolam 
oral triazolam is approved for short term treatment of insomnia 
in june  we signed a letter of understanding with fabre kramer of houston  tx  to jointly pursue the worldwide development and commercialization of hypnostat intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders  two of our product candidates 
under this agreement  we were reimbursed  in for consultants  employees  materials and supplies expenses related to this project 
this original agreement was replaced with a new letter of understanding  dated january  which anticipates entering into a license agreement with the development to be funded by fabre kramer 
we  together with our partner  are developing hypnostat for the short term treatment of insomnia 
we believe that hypnostat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating insomnia 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  cost effectiveness  and possibly reduced side effects 
the potential advantages of hypnostat are significant in light of the fact that thirty to forty million americans suffer from serious sleep disorders which are often untreated or inadequately treated 
continued sleep impairment may cause severe health effects 
oral triazolam halcion has been one of the most successful and most prescribed sleep inducing agents in the world  with over billion prescriptions filled 
oral triazolam is considered safer in terms of overdose  drug interactions  and addictive potential compared to barbiturates 
in addition  oral triazolam produces less morning grogginess  as compared to other benzodiazepines  due to a short plasma half life 
oral triazolam and other benzodiazepines are recommended for short term use in conservative doses 
zolpidem ambien and zaleplon sonata are newer hypnosedative agents that are chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines 
however  both zolpidem and zaleplon have similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and do not differ with respect to efficacy  tolerability  residual effects  memory impairment  rebound insomnia  or abuse potential compared to oral triazolam 
over the counter medications containing diphenhydramine such as benadryl and sominex have been shown to 
table of contents increase the risk of symptoms of delirium including disorganized speech  poor attention level  and altered consciousness in the elderly 
other over the counter medications such as valerian and melatonin may be useful in alleviating mild short term insomnia  but further clinical trials are required to fully evaluate efficacy and safety 
prior clinical trials for hypnostat support that triazolam is absorbed and effective when given intranasally 
phase i trials indicated that the overall amount of triazolam which reaches the plasma is very similar whether the drug is given intranasally or orally 
given the similarity in uptake of the two dosage forms  similarity might also be expected in their clinical performance 
the expected similarity in performance is supported for the intranasal dosage form 
in a prior phase ii pilot study  hypnostat at mg was superior to oral triazolam at mg for time to sleep onset p  effective sleep time p  and stage two sleep time p and was equivalent to oral triazolam at mg for quality of sleep 
we therefore anticipate that intranasal triazolam may be effective for treating insomnia 
the drug is in phase ii stage of development 
panistat through our merger with ribogene  we acquired panistat  an intranasal form of alprazolam 
oral alprazolam is approved for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
questcor and fabre kramer intend to develop panistat for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
we believe that panistat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating panic disorders 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  and cost effectiveness 
the potential advantages of panistat are significant in light of the fact that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorder in the us  affecting approximately million people 
according to the national institute of mental health  approximately of those affected seek treatment 
generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by constant uncontrollable worry 
panic disorder is characterized by acute  spontaneous  and repeated anxiety attacks which involve an intense  terrifying  and unfocused fear in the absence of any external threat 
panic attacks typically last for approximately to minutes and may cause racing heartbeat  chest pains  difficulty breathing  choking sensations  dizziness  and numbness 
panic attacks can occur as often as several times per week or several times per day 
approximately million people in the us suffer from panic disorder  which often progresses into chronic anxiety and agoraphobia 
early treatment can help keep a panic disorder from progressing 
benzodiazepines  including oral alprazolam xanax  have proven to be safe and effective for treating panic disorder for over years 
benzodiazepines block panic attacks during the first or second day of treatment 
surprisingly low rates of abuse of this and other medicines are reported in persons with panic disorder 
many antidepressants  including doxepin sinequan  sertraline zoloft  fluoxetine prozac  imipramine tofranil  and paroxetine hydrochloride paxil  are useful in treating panic attacks without causing physical dependence 
however  successful treatment requires full strength dosage and usually takes four to eight weeks for therapeutic effects to be observed 
in addition  antidepressants cause panic attacks to initially increase in approximately half of panic disorder sufferers 
as a rule  the less expensive antidepressants have more side effects than the newer  more expensive  ones 
phenelzine sulfate nardil is effective for panic disorder  but is complicated to use 
although phenelzine sulfate is safe when used by an experienced physician  it is typically reserved for cases where simpler medications have failed or cannot be used 
unsafe elevations of blood pressure for several hours can occur if one does not adhere to diet and medication restrictions 
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt teaches the patient to anticipate and prepare for situations and bodily sensations that may trigger panic attacks 
cbt generally requires at least eight to twelve weeks for the patient to learn the skills and put them into practice 
cbt requires a motivated patient and a specially trained therapist 
clinical experience suggests that for many patients with panic disorder  a combination of cbt and medication may be the best treatment 
other treatment options include relaxation  breathing techniques  hypnotherapy  and psychotherapy 

table of contents cytoprotective drugs cytoprotective drugs for acute care settings that treat ischemic injury are not currently available and the market opportunities for us may be significant  potentially totaling several million cases annually in the us we believe that our drugs  if approved  may reduce the number of fatalities associated with ischemia related and inherited metabolic disorders and also reduce the high cost of rehabilitation and ongoing care in the us of these patients 
our cytoprotective drugs are administered intravenously  which allows for rapid delivery to the ischemic tissue  or orally  which facilitates chronic administration 
in order to ensure early interventions  our cytoprotective drugs are intended to be standard components in hospital emergency rooms  operating theater suites  endoscopy suites and radiology suites 
chemically demonstrated lack of toxicity should suit them for this purpose  but such a demonstration is dependent on ongoing and future clinical trials  which may not be successful 
ceresine ceresine is a small non peptide molecule  which acts on glycolysis at the level of the mitochondria 
ceresine is a form of sodium dichloroacetate  or dca 
we have licensed or obtained two issued us patents covering the use of ceresine in cerebral ischemia and received orphan drug designation for ceresine for this indication 
we believe that ceresine stimulates a specific enzyme which is present in the membrane of the mitochondria that removes a precursor of lactic acid  known as pyruvic acid  from the cytoplasm of the cell by transporting it into the mitochondria and converting it to acetyl coa 
this results in a reduction of lactic acid in the cell 
increased post ischemia accumulation of lactic acid is a major causal factor in the cessation of glycolysis  the resultant decrease in cellular atp levels and eventual cell death 
numerous studies have shown that ceresine reduces post ischemia lactic acid levels in humans subjected to various traumatic events  which would otherwise have resulted in increased lactic acid or lactic acidosis 
ceresine has been employed by clinical investigators in patients on an experimental basis for the intravenous and oral treatment of lactic acidosis 
published clinical studies and our own phase i data have established that ceresine reduces serum lactic acid and exhibited no serious side effects at the dose levels studied 
ceresine has also been shown in human studies to cross the blood brain barrier and to reduce cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid levels in congenital lactic acidosis patients 
approximately patients participated in the phase i and two phase ii trials of ceresine under our investigational new drug application or ind and the drug was well tolerated 
our phase ii clinical trial data on ceresine in closed head injury patients showed that the drug crosses the blood brain barrier at high levels and very quickly after crossing reduces lactate levels substantially 
this effect lasted for at least hours 
serum lactate levels were also reduced substantially in the drug treated group 
in july  the fda granted expedited development status to ceresine in head injury under subpart e of the fda regulations 
we are not currently pursuing clinical development of ceresine in head injury and have no plans to pursue this indication in the future 
congenital lactic acidosis cla is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction 
mitochondria are sub cellular organelles responsible for production of energy necessary for cellular function and survival 
when mitochondria do not function normally there are inadequate stores of energy atp produced and the accumulation of poisonous metabolic intermediates such as lactate 
clinically  disorders of mitochondrial dysfunction may affect cells of the nervous system retardation  seizures  strokes  migraines  psychiatric disturbances  weakness  poor gastrointestinal function  muscles weakness  cramping  pain  kidneys electrolyte abnormalities  heart cardiomyopathy  heart block  liver hypoglycemia  hepatic failure  eyes blindness  ears deafness and other organs failure to grow normally 
when the mitochondrial problem is severe  the condition is lethal 
in other less extreme instances  there may not be any clinical symptoms 
there are over  patients in the us suffering from some type of mitochondrial disease 
diagnosis of the disorder may be made on physical examination  medical history review  and in some cases special laboratory tests 
these laboratory tests may include identification of the gene responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction 
muscle biopsy is often performed to identify the mitochondrial disorder  however  
table of contents the test is not always diagnostic 
there is currently no effective approved therapy for cla 
temporizing measures such as dietary therapy include avoidance of fasting and use of increased dietary fat 
vitamins have been given without proven benefit 
avoidance of stress and sleep deprivation have also been advocated 
dca has been administered orally to individuals with cla with anecdotal reports of benefit 
some side effects have been observed with chronic dosing  including peripheral neuropathies that required drug interruptions or dose reductions although individuals nearly always were able to continue on treatment 
the treatment of cla with ceresine has also been granted orphan drug status by the fda 
this confers seven years of marketing exclusivity to the first licensed agent as well as certain tax advantages 
an additional six months of exclusivity may be granted upon licensure or at some time prior to the expiration of all existing marketing exclusivity or patent protection if adequate studies have been conducted in pediatric subjects 
to accelerate any potential nda filing  collaborations have been discussed with two academic sites actively investigating dca in individuals with cla 
upon finalization of these two relationships  databases would become available to us 
these databases could be used as part of the clinical information necessary for nda filing with regulatory authorities 
if a clinical benefit is demonstrated  regulatory authorities could act favorably on the application 
we currently have no rights to the data generated by the academic institutions that studied various formulations of dca in patients with cla 
we have been in discussion with these groups about a potential agreement to gain access to the data 
the trials are complete and the data are being analyzed 
the final data analysis will take several months to complete 
after data analysis is complete  if the results are extremely positive and if the combined results are sufficient to allow us to file for an accelerated review with the fda for approval  we may seek to finalize these agreements to gain access to the data 
there can be no assurance  however  that the clinical results would be positive  that we could successfully complete agreements to gain access to the data or that the fda would approve the product for use 
in addition  the studies have been conducted with different formulations of dca 
there is no assurance the fda would not require substantial additional testing of ceresine  or the re formulation of dca used to complete the trials in order to grant approval 
glial excitotoxin release inhibitors geris the geris series of neuroprotective compounds may prevent ischemic brain damage originating from astrocytes astroglial cells 
astrocytes serve important metabolic functions and are thought to be responsible for the bulk of brain swelling following stroke or injury 
the swelling constricts blood vessels and worsens the injury resulting in ischemia and subsequent cell death 
in addition  upon onset of ischemia  astrocytes release excitotoxins such as glutamate and aspartate over an extended period of time not rapidly  as in the case of neurons that result in significant and persistent damage to neurons 
because astrocyte swelling and excitotoxin releases are late stage events in the development of ischemia following brain injury or stroke  they may be more appropriate targets for drug intervention than neuron related events 
in animal models and cell culture experiments  the geri compounds exert a powerful neuroprotective effect by blocking chloride ion channels  to reduce swelling  and by inhibiting excitotoxin release  to limit or prevent damage to neurons 
in vitro  excitotoxin release from cultured astrocytoma cells is fully inhibited at very low concentrations by many compounds of the geri series 
a greater than fold decrease in drug concentration required to inhibit excitotoxin release has been achieved by designing novel derivatives in the geri compound family 
in animal models of global and focal brain ischemia  a number of the geri compounds demonstrated reduction of the infarct volume by as much as in comparison to untreated controls 
in addition  the toxicity profile of existing development candidates appears excellent 
the geri compounds are currently being funded by a small business innovation research sbir grant from the nih 
it is anticipated that reimbursement under this grant will be completed in april although we have had some preliminary discussions with potential corporate partners regarding the geri compounds  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a collaboration to fund future research on these compounds 
pending completion of the reimbursement under the existing sbir grant  we do not intend to expend any additional resources on these compounds 

table of contents at this time  we continue to define the chemical  toxicological and pharmacological effect of a number of geri compounds in animal models having utilized  through december  of the  in funding from an nih sbir grant 
funding for this project expires in april  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in licensing the geri program or that we will realize license fees or revenues from such programs 
discontinued drug development cordox has been studied in the past for a variety of indications including its use in several acute ischemic indications and as a blood preservative 
to date  the results of the clinical studies have not been compelling enough to warrant further development of cordox for any indication 
in september  we completed our final review of the final report from hoxworth blood center in cincinnati on the ability of cordox to improve the biochemical and physical characteristics of stored human red blood cells 
during storage at degrees centigrade  red cell concentrate incubated with cordox did not demonstrate improved levels of atp or  dpg compared to red blood cells stored in currently licensed blood additive solutions 
in addition  experiments with c labeled cordox failed to show metabolism to lactate in stored red blood cells 
the results indicate that cordox does not enter red blood cells and does not reach its intended target 
this is a prerequisite for cordox to have a beneficial effect on cellular metabolism 
based on these results  all further work on cordox has been discontinued 
we intend to terminate all the agreements relating to cordox and dr 
markov  the individual that we obtained the cordox license from 
we have also abandoned all our patents relating to cordox 
drug discovery strategic alliances and collaborations subsequent to our merger with ribogene  we implemented a strategy to focus on the sales and marketing of approved pharmaceutical products and late stage drug development candidates 
as a result  we planned to out license our early stage drug targets and technology 
thus  we discontinued our drug discovery programs in the first quarter of and anticipate that future in house drug discovery research expenses associated with drug discovery will be limited to legal fees  patent costs and other costs to license such programs 
the dainippon agreement we have an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with dainippon to use our antibacterial ppgpp degradase and peptide deformylase technology for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we have retained the right to co promote  in europe and the us  certain products resulting from the arrangement 
we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones in the amount of million in japan and million in one other major market 
we will receive a potential royalty on net sales that will range from to  depending on sales volume and territory 
dainippon has been conducting research on two specific bacterial targets  deformylase and ppgpp degradase 
to date  dainippon has focused most of their efforts on the deformylase project 
several compounds have been synthesized and tested in vivo against drug resistant bacteria 
although the compounds have shown good in vivo activity  dainippon has not selected any compounds for pre clinical studies 
there can be no assurance that dainippon will ever select any compounds for preclinical studies or if selected that these compounds will eventually be approved as drugs 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with dainippon 
the rigel pharmaceuticals agreement we have an exclusive agreement with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel  to use our antiviral technology 
under the agreement  we have assigned to rigel certain antiviral technology  including our hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site and nsa drug discovery technology  for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we will be entitled to potential future 
table of contents milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and royalty payments on sales 
the status of this project is on going 
the tularik agreement in february  we announced that we had exclusively licensed certain antifungal drug research technology to tularik  inc in addition  we have transferred to tularik certain biological and chemical reagents to be used in the discovery and development of novel antifungal agents 
in exchange  we received a cash payment  payment for reimbursement of patent expenses  and will be entitled to future potential milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones as well as royalty payments on sales 
tularik has screened numerous compounds through the antifungal capping assay that it acquired as part of this agreement 
several of these compounds have been identified as having activity against c 
albicans capping enzymes 
tularik is continuing to review these compounds 
the shire pharmaceuticals group plc agreement in july  the option held by shire pharmaceuticals group to acquire exclusive rights to emitasol in north america expired and all rights reverted to us 
in december  shire notified the fda that it will no longer be our agent and  as such  will transfer to us all responsibilities previously conducted by them 
this transfer is currently in progress 
the fabre kramer pharmaceuticals letter of understanding in june  we signed a letter of understanding with fabre kramer of houston  tx  to jointly pursue the worldwide development and commercialization of two of our product candidates  hypnostat intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
this was replaced with a new letter of understanding  dated january this letter of understanding anticipates entering into a license agreement with the development to be funded by fabre kramer 
licenses crinos industria farmacobiologica spa crinos 
in january  as part of our acquisition of emitasol and certain other intranasal products from hyline laboratories  inc  we entered into a license agreement with crinos 
the agreement grants crinos an exclusive license to manufacture and market emitasol in italy 
the agreement expires years after the first commercial sale in italy subject to automatic renewal for three year periods 
in october  the agreement was amended to grant crinos a non exclusive worldwide license to manufacture emitasol 
the amendment provides that we will receive additional royalties on all supply arrangements between crinos and any of our licensees to emitasol 
we may terminate the license agreement in the event crinos fails to pay certain minimum royalties 
we also retain the right to all data generated by crinos on emitasol  including clinical and manufacturing information 
crinos has received governmental approval to market emitasol in italy and launched this product under the trade name pramidin in for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders 
pramidin is marketed in two dosage forms under the names pramidin milligrams ml of active ingredient and pramidin milligrams ml of active ingredient 
to date  we have received minimal royalties from the sale of pramidin in italy 
for the year ended december  unit sales of pramidin were approximately  csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh csc 
in april  ribogene entered into an agreement with csc 
the agreement grants csc an exclusive license to market and sell emitasol in austria  poland  the czech republic  bulgaria  russia  hungary  the slovak republic  romania  and the remaining community of independent states and eight other eastern european countries 
csc has agreed to pay us a royalty based on net sales within the countries listed above 
the agreement will expire on a country by country basis years after the first commercial sale in that country 
although we can terminate the license if csc did not obtain approval in any country contained in the agreement by april   we have not done so  since csc has filed for regulatory approval in austria  russia  hungary and the slovak republic 
in  
table of contents csc received approval to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic 
csc plans to begin marketing in poland and the czech republic in csc has also filed for approval in several other countries 
laboratorios silesia sa 
in december  we signed a license agreement with laboratorios silesia sa for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in chile 
laboratories silesia sa also signed an agreement with crinos to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide  finished product under the trade name pramidin 
this product is sold as pramidin in italy 
we received a small up front payment and will receive royalties on the net sales of emitasol in the territory 
ahn gook pharmaceutical co  ltd 
we entered into a license agreement in december with ahn gook for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook also signed an agreement with crinos to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide finished product  under the trade name pramidin 
this product is sold as pramidin in italy 
under the terms of the agreement  ahn gook will obtain government approval to market emitasol 
we received an up front cash payment of  and are entitled to a milestone payment of  upon approval of the drug for distribution in korea and royalties based on actual sales in korea 
manufacturing we do not currently manufacture any of our acquired products or our products in development 
our commercial products  acthar  ethamolin  glofil  and inulin are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
as part of our agreement with aventis to acquire acthar  aventis agreed to manufacture the finished goods from existing inventory of the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api through july subsequent to this  aventis has agreed in principle as to the terms of the manufacturing agreement but the agreement has not yet been executed 
aventis has provided finished product to us under the proposed agreement 
the production of acthar requires the production of the api and the production of the finished product 
the api is an extraction from porcine pituitary glands 
although the extraction process is well known by individuals within aventis  the extraction may be difficult to reproduce at a new vendor 
as part of the agreement to acquire acthar  we obtained a sufficient supply of the api in order to meet our forecasted demand through we are required to find a new third party manufacturer to produce the api and for the production of the finished goods 
we have identified potential third party manufacturers that could produce the api and the finished product but we have not yet entered into an agreement with any of these manufacturers 
in addition  the production of the api and the finished product are subject to inspection and ultimate approval by the fda 
the acthar site transfer process has numerous risks that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results for us this year and in future years 
such risks include the ability to successfully identify and to enter into agreements with new independent third party contractors for the production of the api and the production of finished goods  or  if we are successful in identifying and entering into such agreements that the api and finished goods could be produced in sufficient quantities on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  that the production facilities and the processes will be approved by the fda and that the api and finished product will be similar in potency and efficacy as the api currently held by aventis 
although we believe we have adequate time and resources to ensure that the site transfer of acthar will occur timely and correctly with minimal impact on future revenues  there can be no assurance that the site transfer will occur timely and correctly and that the transfer will not have a materially adverse impact on the company in the future 
we presently obtain ethamolin from schering plough 
currently schering plough manufactures ethamolin for us on a purchase order basis 
we have had great difficulty obtaining ethamolin from schering plough 
during the fourth quarter of  our inability to acquire ethamolin caused a backorder situation which resulted in us being unable to fulfill orders for the product  resulting in lost revenues for us for the year ended december  we received a batch of approximately  packs of ethamolin in january and were able to ship  of product that had been backordered as of december  we have requested that schering plough manufacture one additional batch of ethamolin  packs which we hope to receive by april  at this time  we are in a backorder situation for ethamolin 
we have 
table of contents identified a new third party manufacturer for ethamolin who has agreed to produce ethamolin for us 
however  the transfer to this new manufacturer will require final approval from the fda 
the new manufacturer has produced initial batches of ethamolin which we expect to commercialize by april  these initial batches are subject to quarantine pending the outcome of certain sterility and other validation tests 
once these initial batches pass these tests and the production facility has passed the fda approval  we may be free to sell these batches 
we have discussed a manufacturing contract with this new manufacturer but have not yet entered into a final agreement 
the site transfer of ethamolin has many risks including the failure to receive fda approval  the failure to pass the sterility and other validation tests  the failure to enter into an agreement on acceptable terms  and the new manufacturer s ability to produce an adequate supply of ethamolin on a timely basis 
we believe we have adequate resources to complete the transfer of ethamolin without a materially adverse impact on us  but if we are unable to overcome some or all of these risks or any as of yet unidentified risks  it could have a material adverse impact on future revenues 
our manufacturer of glofil was recently subject to an inspection by the fda 
as a result of this inspection  our manufacturer received notification that numerous items required attention in order to comply with fda regulations 
we were made aware of this situation and have undergone a review of the potential impact of this inspection on the manufacture of glofil based on the information available  we believe that the manufacture of glofil will not be affected 
in the case of inulin  we are responsible for obtaining the bulk drug from a third party and delivering it to the finished goods manufacturer 
there can be no assurance that any of our bulk or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness or the fda s current good manufacturing practice gmp requirements 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a substitute bulk manufacturer for inulin or acthar or a substitute finished goods manufacturer for acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin  or for any of our other products  nor that all gmp requirements will be met  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
in the case of vsl  we will obtain the product from vsl under our agreement 
however  we have no experience with manufacturing vsl  and we are relying completely on vsl to supply us with the product 
due to our lack of experience with vsl and our reliance on vsl  we can provide no assurances as to the timely manufacture of this product 
our limited manufacturing experience and our dependence upon others for the manufacture of bulk or finished forms of our products may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for any of our products 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others  or on commercially acceptable terms at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
sales and marketing as of december   we have hired  trained and deployed a total of twenty product specialists and marketing personnel to support the commercial sales of acthar  ethamolin  glofil and inulin 
the product specialists are promoting ethamolin to hospital based gastroenterologists  who treat patients with liver disease who develop bleeding esophageal varices  a potentially life threatening disorder 
ethamolin is an fda approved product for the specific indication of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
the promotion of glofil targets organ transplant centers and those patients who are at greatest risk of kidney failure 
the promotion of acthar to pediatric neurologists began during the third quarter of and focused on adequate stocking of wholesalers and hospitals 
we currently distribute all of our products from our distribution location in carlsbad  ca 
in the case of vsl  we plan to promote the product to gastroenterologists and directly to consumers 
since we have no experience with direct consumer marketing  sales and customer support there can be no assurance we will be successful in marketing vsl 
table of contents competition acthar competes with newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteroids  immunosupressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
acthar is currently used in patients suffering from arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and infantile spasm 
several companies offer sclerotherapy agents products that compete with ethamolin 
ethamolin is an injectable drug used to treat patients with bleeding esophageal varices that have recently bled  to prevent bleeding 
other competitive agents include scleromate tm  rubber band ligation methods such as the multi band superview manufactured by boston scientific  the multi band six shooter manufactured by wilson cook  and the multi band ligator by bard and octreotide by novartis 
the competition to market fda approved active bleeding esophageal varices therapies is intense and no assurance can be given that our product will continue to be commercially successful 
a number of companies offer both clinical competition as well as research competition to glofil the clinical competition includes serum creatinine and creatinine clearance methods such as tc dtpa  which is manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc as well as omnipaque  which is manufactured by sanofi  a division of sanofi synthelabo 
research competition includes conray iothalamate nonradiolabeled meglumine  which is also manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc and employed through the mayo clinic 
the competition to market fda approved drugs to measure kidney function by evaluating gfr  is intense and no assurance can be given that our product will continue to be commercially successful 
we have identified culturelle tm by conagra  probiotica by johnson and johnson  and livebac by nutraceutix as competitors to vsl several large companies products will compete with emitasol in the delayed onset emesis market  including zofran ondansetron hydrochlordide by glaxo wellcome  kytril granisetron hydrochloride by smithkline beecham and reglan metoclopramide by ah robins 
these competitive products  however  are available in oral and intravenous delivery forms only 
the competition to develop fda approved drugs for delayed onset emesis and diabetic gastroparesis is intense and no assurance can be given that our product candidate will be developed into commercially successful product 
we are unaware of any competitors at this time to ceresine 
the competition to market fda approved drugs to treat ischemic disorders is intense and no assurance can be given that our product candidates will be commercially successful products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources 
in addition  many of these competitors have substantially greater experience than we do in developing  testing and obtaining fda and other approvals of pharmaceuticals 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of the pharmaceuticals in our pipeline  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new technologies that are superior to our technologies  our ability for us to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can develop products  complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 

table of contents government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical firms  including manufacturers from whom we purchase products  are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals  or to review the status of currently exempt pharmaceuticals and to require application and approval of prescription drugs if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 
drug products must be manufactured  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with gmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with current gmps 
also  the fda regulates the distribution of drug samples 
both the fda and the drug enforcement agency dea may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
drugs in development our products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca and the public health service act  and foreign governmental authorities prior to commercialization 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
the research activities required by the fda before a drug can be approved for marketing begin with extensive preclinical animal and laboratory testing 
the tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies for the safety and efficacy of the drug 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of an ind which is reviewed by the fda prior to beginning clinical trials  first in normal volunteers and then in patients with the disease 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients  under the supervision of a qualified physician principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with governmental statutes  regulations and guidelines and under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be evaluated by an independent institutional review board  referred to as the irb  at the institution at which the study will be conducted 
the irb considers  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution  and approves the informed consent to be obtained from all subjects and patients in the clinical trials 
we will have to monitor the conduct of clinical investigators in performing clinical trials and their compliance with fda requirements 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase i  phase ii and phase iii  but these phases may overlap 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to any of our drugs 

table of contents furthermore  we or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is felt that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the investigational product lacks any demonstrable efficacy 
the results of the pharmaceutical development  preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda or  in the case of a biological product  a biologics license application bla for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product 
the testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time frequently five to eight years or more and expense  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda may deny an nda or bla if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  require additional testing or information  or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of our drugs 
notwithstanding the submission of the nda or bla and any additional testing data or information  the fda may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval 
finally  drug and biological product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with labeling and current good manufacturing practices regulatory standards is not maintained or if unexpected safety or efficacy problems occur following initial marketing 
among the conditions for clinical studies and nda or bla approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cgmp  which must be followed at all times 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
also  companies that engage in pharmaceutical development  such as questcor  are required to pay user fees of more than  upon submission of an nda or bla 
no fee is required for the submission of an nda or bla for an orphan product and waivers of the user fee are also available under other circumstances 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
for marketing outside the us  we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
vsl we intend to market vsl as a dietary supplement 
if we pursue fda approval of vsl as a biological product  we will be subject to the regulatory hurdles discussed above 
the manufacturing  distribution  and sale of dietary supplements and medical foods are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  principally the fda and the federal trade commission the ftc 
our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which vsl is manufactured  distributed  and sold 
among other matters  the fda and ftc are concerned with product safety and claims that refer to a product s ability to provide dietary support for health related conditions 
the regulation of dietary supplements is principally governed by the dietary supplement health and education act dshea  which were enacted in  amending the fdca 
we believe dshea is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry 
dshea establishes a statutory class of dietary supplements  which includes vitamins  minerals  herbs  amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet 
dietary ingredients that were not on the market as of october  require the submission by the manufacturer or distributor to the fda of evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
among other things  dshea prevents the further regulation of dietary ingredients as food additives and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels 
the fda has issued proposed and final regulations in this area and indicates that further guidance and regulations are forthcoming 

table of contents the fda has announced its intent to issue gmp regulations for the dietary supplement industry 
the fda has published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking  and publication of proposed regulations is expected soon 
in november  the ftc bureau of consumer protection announced its new advertising guidelines for the dietary supplement industry  which it labeled dietary supplements an advertising guide for industry 
these guidelines reiterate many of the policies the ftc has announced over the years  including requirements for substantiation of claims made in advertising about dietary supplements 
the regulation of medical foods is principally governed by the fdca and fda regulations 
a product qualifies as a medical food if it is specially formulated for the feeding of a patient  is intended for the dietary management of a patient who has special dietary needs  provides nutritional support for the management of the unique nutritional needs of the patient  and is intended to be used under active medical supervision 
moreover  an ingredient added to a food  including a medical food  must be approved by an fda food additive petition unless it is generally recognized as safe gras for its particular intended use 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in large measure upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our products  maintain confidentiality and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have obtained patent coverage  either directly or through licenses from third parties  for some of our products 
we currently own or have licensed a total of nineteen issued us and foreign patents covering hypnostat  four issued us and foreign patents covering emitasol  one issued us patent covering geri  and twelve issued us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
we acquired intellectual property associated with our intranasal program  including emitasol for diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis associated with chemotherapy  migrastat intranasal propranolol for migraine treatment  and intranasal benzodiazepines such as hypnostat and panistat for various conditions such as anxiety  seizures  panic attacks and sleep disorders 
we have licensed rights to intranasal metoclopramide in  italy  chile  south korea  austria  the russian federation  and certain former eastern european countries 
the italian licensee  crinos  received approval to market intranasal metoclopramide pramidin in italy 
we are currently earning small royalties on our sales of pramidin 
there can be no assurance that the foreign licensees will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market emitasol  or that  in the event such approvals are obtained  emitasol will achieve market acceptance in such countries  or that we will ever realize royalties on sales of emitasol in such countries 
in addition to the patents issued and allowed as mentioned above  we have also filed several other patent applications in the us and abroad on our various products and expect to file additional applications in the future 
there can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will be approved  except where claims have already been examined and allowed  or that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
nor can there be any assurance that any patents issued to us or our licensors will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on the ability of us to conduct our business 
furthermore  because patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until issue  and because publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first chronologically to make the inventions covered by each of our pending us patent applications  or we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
in the event that a third party has also filed a us patent application for any of its inventions  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of the invention  which could result in substantial costs to us  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our us patents  including those of our licensors  would be held valid by a court of law of competent jurisdiction 
if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims  which ultimately may be determined to be valid  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license to any of these patents 
under title of the united states code  as amended by the general agreement on tariffs and trade implementing the uruguay round agreement act of  commonly referred to as gatt  patents that issue 
table of contents from patent applications filed prior to june  will enjoy a year period of enforceability as measured from the date of patent issue while those that issue from applications filed on or after june  will enjoy a year period of enforceability as measured from the date the patent application was filed or the first claimed priority date  whichever is earlier 
patents that issue from applications filed on or after june  may be extended under the term extension provisions of gatt for a period up to five years to compensate for any period of enforceability lost due to interference proceedings  government secrecy orders or appeals to the board of patent appeals or the federal circuit 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  including amendments implemented under gatt  the period of enforceability of a first or basic product patent or use patent covering a drug may be extended for up to five years to compensate the patent holder for the time required for fda regulatory review of the product 
this law also establishes a period of time following fda approval of certain drug applications during which the fda may not accept or approve applications for similar or identical drugs from other sponsors 
any extension under the patent term restoration act and any extension under gatt are cumulative 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of the patent term extensions or marketing exclusivity provisions of these laws 
while we cannot predict the effect that such changes will have on our business  the adoption of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to protect our proprietary information and sustain the commercial viability of our products 
furthermore  the possibility of shorter terms of patent protection  combined with the lengthy fda review process and possibility of extensive delays in such process  could effectively further reduce the term during which a marketed product could be protected by patents 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we have been and will continue to be required to disclose our trade secrets and proprietary know how to employees and consultants  potential corporate partners  collaborators and contract manufacturers 
although we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with such persons  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
employees at december   we had full time employees as compared to full time employees at december   seven of whom are engaged in  or directly support  our research and development activities 
of the employees engaged in research and development activities  two hold phd degrees 
in the first quarter of  we discontinued our drug discovery programs and terminated eleven employees associated with early stage drug discovery 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
at december   we had employees engaged directly in the marketing and selling of our on market products 
our potential growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as business development  direct to consumer marketing and customer support  contract manufacturing  medical affairs  clinical development  regulatory affairs and sales and marketing  are expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
these demands are expected to require an increase in management  manufacturing  customer support  regulatory  and sales personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining management  sales and marketing  customer service and support  business development  medical affairs and regulatory affairs personnel in the future will also be critical to the our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management  and operational personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and other research institutions for such personnel 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors dependence on key personnel 

table of contents risk factors we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability we have a history of consistent operating losses 
further substantial operating losses will continue over the next year and if we are unable to achieve our sales forecast and maintain expenses in a way that allows us to reach breakeven by the end of substantial operating losses will continue to occur 
to date  our revenues have been generated principally from sales of acthar  ethamolin  glofil  and inulin  the licensing of rights to commercialize certain research technology and the manufacturing of our proprietary topical triple antibiotic wound care product for our over the counter marketing partner  nutramax products  inc during  we discontinued the neoflo product line and we discontinued all work on cordox 
we do not expect hypnostat  panistat  migrastat  ceresine  or any of the compounds currently in pre clinical testing to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
further  our revenues from the sale of emitasol will also be dependent on the fda approval and the development of emitasol in conjunction with a new strategic partner which has not yet been obtained 
in december  we acquired the us rights to market vsl  a patented probiotic 
we intend to begin generating sales of vsl in the first half of our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to finance the operations with external capital until positive cash flows are achieved  finance and acquire additional marketed products  increase sales of current products  finance the future growth of the sales marketing and customer service organization  enter into agreement with corporate partners for the development of emitasol  properly and timely perform the transfer of the manufacturing of our products to new contract manufacturers including receiving the appropriate approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities  and continue to receive products from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs with the exception of vsl  no new product launches are planned 
there can be no assurance that sufficient revenues from the sale of our products will be generated  nor can there be assurance that we will ever generate sufficient revenues and be able to contain costs and expenses to become profitable 
our inability to secure additional funding could lead to a loss of your investment although we recently completed a million financing in the form of convertible debentures due in with an institutional investor and sigma tau  there can be no assurance that this investment combined with our cash on hand will be adequate to fund operations to reach cash flow breakeven 
there can also be no assurance that further capital investments will materialize nor that these investments can be completed at attractive terms to us  or that we will receive any additional capital investments at all 
in order to conduct our operating activities  we will require substantial additional capital resources in order to acquire new products  increase sales of existing products  and maintain our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  sales performance of vsl  cost maintenance and potential future expansion of the sales force  achieving lower cost of goods sold and better operating efficiencies  obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers and completing the site transfer to new contract manufacturers  
table of contents the acquisition of additional product candidates  and the status of the equity markets  in general  and investor s tolerance for risk 
based on our internal forecast and projections  we believe that our cash on hand at december  together with the million of cash raised through the issuance of the convertible debentures and the cash to be generated through the expected sales of our products  will be sufficient to fund operations through december  we anticipate obtaining additional financing through corporate partnerships and public or private debt or equity financing 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our shareholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our product acquisition  or manufacturing efforts 
there can be no assurance we can achieve cash flow breakeven by the end of or that our existing cash resources will be adequate to fund operations beyond the end of our reliance on contract manufacturers could adversely affect our business we will rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce the clinical supplies for emitasol  and ceresine and for the marketed products  acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl  and other products that may be developed or commercialized in the future 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no alternative suppliers exist 
in addition  we do not have contracts in place with the contract manufacturer for ethamolin and the bulk product for inulin 
we are negotiating a supply agreement with aventis for the finished product but we do not have a contract in place for the supply of acthar api 
we are also attempting to transfer the finished product manufacturing for acthar and ethamolin 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products and substances on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the site transfers and the corresponding approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities does not occur on a timely basis at the appropriate costs to us  we will lose sales and our clinical testing could be delayed  leading to a delay in the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of these products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  the fda approval of our products will not be granted 
during december of  we were on backorder for ethamolin and acthar due to manufacturing constraints at two of our third party contract manufacturers 
at this time  we are currently on backorder for ethamolin 
there is no guarantee that we will not have backorders in the future for ethamolin and acthar or any of our current or future products nor that we will not be on backorder again 
failure to obtain product for sale for any reason will have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of questcor 
we rely heavily on sales of acthar for the quarter and the year ended december   acthar revenues comprised and of total product revenues respectively 
we also expect that acthar could contribute to a significant portion of the revenues for although our goal is to actively promote acthar  and we have no reason to believe acthar will not be successful  there can be no assurance that the strong demand for acthar will continue and that we will continue to generate significant revenues from the sale of acthar 
if the demand for acthar declines  or if we are forced to reduce the price  or if the cost to produce acthar increases  our revenue and results from operations would be adversely affected 
we will be dependent on key personnel we are highly dependent on the services of charles j 
casamento  chairman  president  and chief executive officer and kenneth greathouse  vice president of commercial operations 
while mr 
casamento has executed an employment agreement there can be no assurance that mr 
casamento or mr 
greathouse will continue to be employed by us in the future 
the loss of mr 
casamento  mr 
greathouse or both could 
table of contents materially harm our business 
the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
although some increases in staffing levels are expected during  these future demands are expected to require a substantial increase in management personnel to perform operational work as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  business development  regulatory affairs  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and other research institutions for such personnel 
our products may not be accepted by the market our current development program focuses on emitasol 
emitasol  intranasal metoclopramide could be developed for two indications diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy patients 
the diabetic gastroparesis drug candidate was being developed in collaboration with a subsidiary of shire  in the us and had completed a phase ii clinical trial in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis 
with the expiration in july of the exclusive option held by shire  development under this collaboration stopped 
further development of emitasol is on hold pending our entering into an agreement with a future partner to fund the development of emitasol 
we also have two intranasal drug candidates  on which pilot trials have been conducted migrastat for migraine headache and hypnostat for insomnia 
there is no guarantee that any of these drugs will successfully complete phase iii testing 
we expect that the failure of one or more of these drugs to successfully pass phase iii testing would likely have a materially adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we cannot guarantee  however  that the products will ever successfully pass such testing phases  and if so  result in commercially successful products 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which may delay  limit or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing can vary by product and by the indicated use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
any products that we successfully develop  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize any products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of any products that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could materially harm our business 
we have no experience marketing vsl we intend to market vsl as a dietary supplement 
dietary supplements are typically not reimbursable by healthcare providers 
this may limit our sales of vsl we also do not know what the demand for 
table of contents vsl will be 
these factors may adversely and materially impact our ability to meet forecasted sales in and beyond 
control by existing shareholders sigma tau and their affiliates own  directly or indirectly  approximately of the common stock outstanding as of march  accordingly  these shareholders can control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us 
in addition  these shareholders own warrants to purchase another  shares of common stock as well as a million convertible debenture 
if this warrant exercise were to occur  sigma tau and their affiliates would own a significantly greater percentage of our outstanding common stock  thus resulting in substantial dilution to existing shareholders 
our business could be harmed by intense competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products which target the same diseases and conditions that we will target 
for example  there are products on the market that compete with acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin  and vsl moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business  may be acquired or licensed by competitors of questcor  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our abilities to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology and to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any which we are developing or which would render our technology and future drugs obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and 
table of contents fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
there can be no assurance that drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partner  will be able to compete successfully with competitors existing products or products under development or that we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 
successful late stage phase iii clinical trials for such potentially important treatments as diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis will require the enrollment of many patients 
together  the cost of these trials  if funded solely by us  will exceed our current financial resources 
if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our business could adversely be affected our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology or marketed products for development and commercialization 
there is no assurance we can enter into any new agreements in the future 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
there can be no assurance that any collaborators will commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
therefore  any such termination could materially harm our business 
there can be no assurance that any of our collaborations will be successful in developing and commercializing products or that we will receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our collaboration agreement with shire pharmaceuticals group plc presents a great amount of uncertainty under a collaboration agreement between shire after its acquisition of roberts pharmaceuticals and us  shire had the option to acquire exclusive north american rights to emitasol 
this option expired in july under that collaboration agreement  we were obligated to fund one half of the clinical development expenses for emitasol up to an aggregate of million 
through december  we have made development payments for emitasol  under the terms of the agreement with shire  totaling million  consisting of million paid to shire and approximately  paid to other parties for allowable expenses including patent and trademark costs 
shire asserts we owe  in development expenses incurred by it under the collaboration agreement prior to the expiration of the option 
we have requested that shire return certain items to us  including the manufacturing and clinical data it obtained over the course of the agreement  the transfer of the inds relating to emitasol which is substantially complete and the assignment of the intellectual property relating to emitasol generated in the course of the development program 
while shire has returned some of these items  
table of contents we are still in discussion with them as to the resolution of other open items 
the failure to quickly resolve any open items on favorable terms relating to this collaboration could have a material adverse impact on our ability to find a new partner to continue the development of emitasol 
shire holds all of our outstanding  series a preferred shares which represents a beneficial ownership percentage of approximately as of march  if we are unable to settle our disagreements quickly  we may end up in a protracted contract dispute with a major shareholder which may have unpredictable material adverse effects on us going forward 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
there can be no assurance that our activities will not infringe on patents owned by others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against any licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
no assurance can be given that any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business and product approvals must comply with strict government regulation any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the us  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of 
table of contents substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances would adversely affect the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that our corporate partners or we develop  could impose significant additional costs on our corporate partners  and us could diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda has recently revised the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that might have an adverse effect on the development  production and marketing of our products 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
we may not be reimbursed by third party payers in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the us and private insurance plans 
vsl currently does not qualify for any reimbursements by third party payors 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the us  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
in addition  we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for existing products may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products  which could result in lower product sales or revenues which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
in the us proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
if such changes are enacted  they may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been under consideration in several states 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to its innovative medicines  our business could be materially affected 
on the other hand  relatively little pharmaceutical use is currently covered by medicare 
legislation in the us requires us to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program 
we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
there can be no assurance that these discounts and rebates may become burdensome to us  which may adversely affect our current business and future product development 

table of contents we will incur costs associated with expanding the business management expects to grow the business in areas in which we can be most competitive  either through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
in connection with these efforts  we may incur significant charges  costs and expenses which could impact our profitability  including impairment losses  restructuring charges  the write off of purchased in process technologies  transaction related expenses  costs associated with integrating new businesses and the cost of amortizing goodwill and other intangibles 
our stock price is subject to volatility the price of our stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may affect the stock price 
these include  without limitation  the quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings  results of clinical trials conducted by us  our partners or by our competitors  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners  corporate restructuring by us  licensing activities by us  and the acquisition or sale by us of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with our research and development collaborations  from time to time we invest in equity securities of our corporate partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect our stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
our sales are affected by the availability of reimbursement on non prescription products in the us and other significant markets  sales of our products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology and pharmaceutical products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
our business may be affected by product liability and availability of insurance our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in a sufficient amount  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not harm our reputation  stock price or our business 
we could be adversely affected by litigation although there are currently no lawsuits pending against us  we could be adversely affected by litigation 
potential litigation could arise from a number of factors including disputes with past  current and future employees and partners  class action litigation relating to shareholder lawsuits or product liability claims  frivolous lawsuits filed on behalf of manufactured plaintiffs or any other items not foreseen at this time 
we believe we have adequate insurance to protect ourselves against certain claims but there can be no assurance that this insurance coverage will be of any use against any future claims 
if we were to become subject to any 
table of contents lawsuit  regardless of its nature and claims  our time and resources  including that of management  could be severely impacted 
this in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition

in conjunction with the november acquisition of ribogene  we changed our fiscal year end from july to december we accounted for the merger transaction as a purchase 
a write off of  for in process research and development acquired from ribogene is included in our statement of operations for the five months ended december  the intangible assets acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives of years 
since the completion of the merger  we have focused our resources on i acquiring new products  ii increasing the sales of our existing products  and iii out licensing and partnering our research and development stage products 
during  we completed our transition from operating as essentially two independent companies to emerge as a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the sales and marketing of our branded products 
we currently market four products in the us acthar  an injectable drug that helps patients with infantile spasm or west syndrome  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat esophageal varices that have recently bled  and glofil and inulin in sodium chloride  which are both injectable agents that assess kidney function by measuring glomerular filtration rate 
additionally  we earn royalties from our strategic partner  crinos industria farmacobiologica spa crinos on sales in italy  of pramidin  an intranasal form of metoclopramide for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders 
we recently acquired the us rights to market vsl a patented probiotic 
we intend to begin sales of vsl in the first half of consistent with our efforts to focus on sales and marketing  we have reduced our spending on research and development 
accordingly  we have entered into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain technology acquired from ribogene 
we have signed a letter of understanding with fabre kramer of houston  tx which anticipates a license agreement whereby fabre kramer will manage and provide funding for the clinical development programs for hypnostat intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
the antifungal drug discovery program has been partnered with tularik  inc  of south san francisco  ca  the antiviral drug discovery program has been partnered with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc of south san francisco  ca

the development of hypnostat and panistat will be controlled by fabre kramer 
the future development of emitasol  ceresine and the geri compounds  will be dependent in part on our ability to enter into partnership arrangements or secure additional sources of capital to fund the development efforts 
the development of sildaflo and cordox has been discontinued 
as we rely on current and future strategic partners to develop and fund the remaining projects  we are unable to project estimated completion dates 
we have limited control  if any  over these programs due to our reliance on partners for their development

in april  we entered into a stock and warrant purchase agreement with sigma tau finance holding sa sigma tau pursuant to which sigma tau purchased i an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  and ii a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in may  as required under the rules of amex  we sought and received shareholder approval to allow for full exercise of the warrant 
in july  sigma tau assigned the warrant to paolo cavazza and claudio cavazza  the principal shareholders of sigma tau  who exercised the warrant in full  purchasing  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds to us of  including the  originally paid by sigma tau to acquire the warrant 
in july  concurrent with our agreement to acquire acthar from aventis  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with sigma tau pursuant to which sigma tau purchased  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  in december  we entered into a promotion agreement with vsl pharmaceuticals  inc  a private company owned in part by the principal shareholders of sigma tau  to promote  sell and distribute the product vsl in the us in connection with this promotion agreement  we entered into two stock and warrant purchase agreements  one with paolo cavazza and one with claudio cavazza  to purchase i an aggregate of  shares of common stock for a purchase price of per share representing a twenty percent premium to our market price for the five days prior to execution of the purchase agreements  for an aggregate purchase price of  and ii warrants  at an aggregate purchase price of  to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share before december  we issued the common stock related to this transaction in february additionally  in connection with this transaction  we entered into a standstill agreement with sigma tau whereby sigma tau and its affiliates agreed to limit purchases of common stock on the open market to no more that  shares through july assuming sigma tau exercises its warrants in full  they would own approximately including the  shares of common stock issued in february of our outstanding common stock as of december  on april   we closed a financing with various investors which totaled  this investment came from a group of individual investors 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and sold warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to per share 
the warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance until the close of business on april  on march   in two separate transactions  we issued million of convertible debentures to an institutional investor and sigma tau 
we will pay interest on the debentures at a rate of per annum on a quarterly basis 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share subject to adjustment for stock splits and reclassifications 
at the end of the term of the debenture  under certain circumstances  we have the option to repay the principal in stock and  under certain circumstances  we can also redeem the debenture for cash prior to maturity 
the debentures mature on march  in conjunction with this transaction  we issued warrants to both the institutional investor and sigma tau to acquire an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
both warrants expire on march  in connection with the issuance of the debentures and warrants  we expect to record a deferred expense related to a beneficial conversion feature 
this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the debentures 
assuming the conversion and exercise of the above mentioned 
table of contents debenture and warrant by sigma tau and assuming the exercise of all other outstanding warrants held by sigma tau  sigma tau would own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  we have sustained an accumulated deficit of  from inception through december  at december   we had million of cash on hand 
on january   we paid our million note and reduced our cash balance accordingly 
based on our internal forecast and projections  we believe that our cash on hand at december   together with the million of cash raised through the issuance of the above mentioned convertible debentures and the cash to be generated through the expected sale of our products  will be sufficient to fund operations through december  while it is our goal to reach cash flow breakeven before the end of  if we are unable to achieve the revenue forecast for or if our expenses and costs associated with running our operations exceed our estimates  we may not reach cash flow breakeven before the end of  if ever  and we may incur significant operating losses over the next several years 
results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the establishment of strategic alliances and corporate partnering and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales allowances we record estimated sales allowances against product revenues for expected returns  chargebacks and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate product returns based on historical return experience  the shelf life of our products ranging from days to years and compliance with our return goods policy 
if historical return experience differs from estimated future returns  or if a new product has return experience different than our estimate  this could negatively impact our revenue 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable

table of contents product revenues increased for the year ended december  to  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased product sales and the introduction of acthar 
we began shipping the acthar product in the third quarter of and recognized sales of  for the year ended december  in addition  excluding revenues from the discontinued neoflo product line  we experienced an overall increase of in revenues from existing products when compared to last year s sales 
revenues of ethamolin increased to  glofil increased to  inulin increased to  as compared to   and  respectively  for the year ended december  the total increase in product revenues from these core products was  of which of this increase is related to unit growth in as compared to  with the remainder of this increase related to a price increase in as compared to we estimate the use of ethamolin for the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  we are at times unable to stock a sufficient supply of acthar and ethamolin to meet the demand for these products 
ethamolin was placed on backorder at the end of october and acthar was placed on backorder to customers at the end of november at december  we had backorders amounting to  for acthar and  for ethamolin 
all backorders for acthar and ethamolin as of december  were shipped in january in may  our sole customer for our neoflo product  nutramax products  inc  filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on april   the us bankruptcy court granted nutramax a motion to terminate our supply agreement effective that date 
in may  we closed our lee s summit manufacturing facility where the nutramax product was being produced 
net sales to nutramax totaled  and  for the years ended december  and respectively   for the five months ended december  and  for the year ended july   representing   and of total revenues  respectively 
contract research and grant revenue increased to  for the year ended december  due to a full year of revenue recognized for government reimbursement under the sbir grant previously awarded to fund the geri project 
we do not anticipate any additional contract revenue after the sbir grant expires on april  technology revenue for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december   due to the recognition of  in technology revenue from the sale of our proprietary antiviral drug research technology to rigel pharmaceuticals  inc in we do not anticipate much  if any  technology revenue in the future 
royalty revenue increased to  due to increased sales of pramidin in italy by crinos 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of product sales decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  these costs decreased primarily as a result of our discontinuance of the neoflo product line in the neoflo product had the highest overhead and material costs relative to our other products 
excluding the cost of product sales associated with neoflo  cost of product sales increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is related to the increased volume of product sales in as compared to gross margins for marketed products for the year ended december  were for acthar  for ethamolin  for glofil and for inulin  compared to   and  respectively  for the year ended december  gross margins for the products other than acthar improved as a result of increased sales volume  and product price increases in acthar was introduced in september sales and marketing expense increased by to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales force  which began in late however  as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts on our existing product lines and prepare for the launch of vsl 
table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was related to our cost reduction program that resulted in a decrease in personnel and related expenses  lower facility costs  legal fees  bad debt expense and professional services costs  offset by an increase in non cash equity related compensation expense 
we expect general and administrative costs may slightly increase in the future as compared to if the revenue levels exceed those for  however  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues should decline in research and development expense decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  since the completion of our merger with ribogene in  we have reduced our focus on research and development of non marketed products 
the decrease was related to lower development expenses for emitasol tm and an overall reduction of expenses related to our research and development activities 
should we elect to undertake any development work  we expect to fund future clinical trials and additional research and development from our anticipated revenues 
should our revenue projections differ from actual results we would expect our research and development costs to increase or decrease accordingly 
since we no longer market or sell the neoflo product we recorded a loss related to the discontinued neoflo product line in the amount of  as of december  this loss represents a writedown of the assets directly related to the neoflo product line and the estimated remaining lease payments for the lee s summit manufacturing facility 
depreciation and amortization expense for the period decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to an additional charge of  in to depreciation expense in order to reflect the change in the estimated useful life of certain laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
net interest and other income decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  principally due to a lower return on invested cash  as well as a lower average cash balance  partially offset by reduced interest expense due to lower rates 
net rental income increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due to the receipt of a one time payment of  for vacating our hayward facility in may when we moved to our new headquarters in union city  ca  we subleased of our hayward facility 
all sublease income  and the related costs for the hayward premises are classified as rental income  net 
although the current rental income from the sublessee exceeds the current rental expense on the hayward facility  there can be no assurance our sublessee will not default on the sublease agreement  and if they were to do so  we would still be obligated to pay rent expense on this property 
estimated sublease income and rent expense for the hayward facility is  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to the five months ended december  the comparison data presented below is for information purposes 
it is difficult to analyze variances between the year ended december  and the five months ended december  for two reasons the comparative periods are different and the five months ended december  includes merger related restructuring charges

gross margins for the marketed products for the year ended december  were for ethamolin  for glofil  for inulin  and for the rolled padded stock  compared to the   and  respectively  for the five month period ended december  the negative gross margin in rolled padded stock for the period resulted from the initial production and start up costs for that product

the gross margins for glofil and inulin have been historically affected by shrinkage resulting from short shelf lives
