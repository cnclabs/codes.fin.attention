all years refer to the company s fiscal year which ends on june and have been restated for consistent presentation of discontinued operations 
the table below sets forth  for the periods indicated  the customer mix in revenue with related percentages of total revenue 
dollars in thousands department of defense federal civilian agencies commercial state local government total revenue 
for the year ended june   the company s total revenue increased by million  or 
the growth in revenue came primarily from higher levels of managed network and systems integration services business from federal government customers along with the acquisition of dsic 
total revenue in fy increased million  or  from million to million 
the increase was primarily in the managed network services business as a result of the combination of internal growth and the acquisition of the federal services business 
all of the company s acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of their operations have been included in the company s revenue since the date of acquisition 
acquisitions made during the last two fiscal years accounted for million of the fy revenue growth 
as previously described  on november   the company purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of dsic 
in fy  dsic contributed approximately million in revenue 
on december   the company acquired the federal services business  which contributed approximately million of revenue in fy other acquisitions accounted for approximately million of revenues for fy revenue from dod increased  or million  for fy as compared to fy in fy  dod revenue increased  or million  as compared to fy dod revenue growth from fy to fy was primarily due to internal growth in the managed network and engineering services as well as the aforementioned acquisitions of dsic and the federal services business 
revenue from federal civilian agencies increased  or million  for fy as compared to fy approximately of federal civilian agency revenue was derived from doj  for which the company provides litigation support services and maintains an automated debt management system 
revenue from doj was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
in fy  the company also experienced increased revenue growth of  or million  from federal civilian agencies other than doj as compared to fy the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of dsic as well as increased task orders on our gwac contracts 
commercial revenue  primarily derived from the company s international operations  decreased by  or million  for the twelve months ended june  this decrease in commercial revenue in fy compared to fy came from the company s exposure to the international telecommunications market  where there have been difficult conditions  and from lower pass through revenues on systems project s where the third party hardware  software and subcontract content of these projects was substantially lower this year than in the prior year 
in fy  as compared to fy  commercial revenue increased by million  or 
the slower growth rate was primarily due to the impact of a decrease of approximately in the average foreign exchange rate of pounds sterling for the year compared to fy revenue from state and local governments decreased  or million  to million for the year ended june  as compared to the same period a year ago 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to the phase out of work on two state contracts 
the company s continued and expanded focus on dod and federal civilian agency opportunities is resulting in a reduced emphasis on state and local governments 
as a percentage of total revenue  state and local government revenues decreased significantly from million  or  in fy to million  or  in fy the decrease was attributable primarily to the reduced level of yk remediation business 
results of operations 
the following table sets forth the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue 
consolidated statement of operations twelve months ended june    dollars in thousands year to date year to date change fy fy fy fy fy fy fy to fy fy to fy revenue cost expenses direct costs indirect costs selling expenses depreciation amortization goodwill amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from operations 
operating income increased  or million  in fy as compared to the same period a year ago 
the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
see note  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill  accounted for operating income growth of approximately 
the balance of the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increased volume of business  higher gross margins across all lines of business and the acquisition of dsic 
during the last three years  as a percentage of revenue total direct costs were  and  respectively 
direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs such as equipment purchases  subcontract costs and travel expenses 
other direct costs are common in our industry  typically are incurred in response to specific client tasks and are difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty 
the largest component of direct costs  direct labor  was million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in direct labor was due to the growth in our federal government business  both in the dod and federal civilian agencies  as well as from the acquisitions of dsic and the federal services business 
other direct costs were million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in other direct costs was primarily the result of increased volume of tasking across all lines of business and the acquisition of disc 
indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits  marketing and bid and proposal costs  indirect labor and other discretionary costs 
most of these expenses are highly variable and have grown in dollar volume generally in proportion to the growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  however  indirect costs and selling expenses have declined over the last three fiscal years 
they were  and for fy  fy and fy  respectively 
such continued decline is due to the impact of higher other direct costs on revenue and to infrastructure economies of scale within the company 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased  or million  in fy as compared to fy the increase was partly due to the amortization of intangible assets purchased in recent acquisitions which were amortized as part of goodwill prior to the release of sfas nos 
and 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to the completion of software developed for internal use and purchases of computer equipment and software licenses 
effective july   the company adopted sfas nos 
and  which relate to business combinations and the amortization of goodwill 
in compliance with these accounting pronouncements the company recorded no goodwill amortization expense during fy goodwill amortization was million and million in fy and fy  respectively 
interest expense decreased  or million  in fy as compared to fy this decrease was attributable to the proceeds from the company s secondary stock offering in march  which generated approximately million in available funds 
the proceeds of such offering allowed the company to pay down a significant portion of debt and also accounted for over thousand in interest income 
the effective income tax rates in fy  fy and fy  were  and  respectively 
quarterly financial information quarterly financial data for the two most recent fiscal years is provided in the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
see note  quarterly financial data unaudited in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation approximately of the company s business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which automatically adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
over of the business is under time and materials contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
the company generally has been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portion of the company s business is fixed price and relates primarily to product sales or other short term efforts that generally are not adversely affected by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs and support acquisition activities 
working capital was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the million increase in working capital in fy was primarily attributable to the cash generated from the company s secondary stock offering 
operating activities provided cash of million and million for fy and fy  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to growth in earnings and the company s continued cash collection efforts 
the company used million in investing activities in fy and million for the same period last year 
this increase of million was due primarily to the acquisition of dsic  payments due in connection with the acquisition of the federal services business  and the company s purchase of million in short term marketable securities in fy the company also generated funds of million from the sale of its domestic marketing systems group in january purchases of office and computer related equipment of million  million and million in fy  fy and fy  respectively  accounted for a significant portion of the remaining funds used in investing activities 
during fy  the company financed its investing activities and operations with its available line of credit  and also from million of net proceeds raised from its secondary stock offering and million of cash received from the exercise of stock options 
the company used a portion of these proceeds to pay down its borrowings by million 
for fy  financing activities provided cash of million primarily from net borrowings of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million offset by million used to buy back stock to be held in treasury 
in anticipation of continuing its strategy of acquisitions and in order to secure lower interest rates  on february   the company executed a five year unsecured revolving line of credit 
the agreement permits borrowings of up to million with annual sublimits on amounts borrowed for acquisitions also see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company also maintains a  pounds sterling unsecured line of credit in london  england  which expires in december at june   the company had no borrowings under this line of credit 
the company believes that the combination of internally generated funds  available bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources for the foreseeable future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of june   we had investments in marketable securities of million 
all of these securities consisted of highly liquid investments that had remaining maturities of less than days at june  these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the june  rates would not cause a material change in the value of these short term investments 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
as of june   we did not own any equity investments 
therefore  we did not have any material equity price risk 
on january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million under which the company pays a fixed interest rate of plus the applicable spread  currently and receives the prevailing libor interest rate  plus applicable spread over the two year term of the swap agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
of the outstanding borrowings at june   the entire million is covered by this swap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at june   as determined by bank of america  was thousand and has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
approximately and of the company s total revenues in and  respectively  were derived from international customers  primarily in the united kingdom 
the company s practice is to negotiate contracts in the same currency in which the predominant expenses are incurred  thereby mitigating the exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
it is not possible to accomplish this in all cases  thus  there is some risk that profits will be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the company had approximately million in cash that is held in pounds sterling 
this allows the company to better utilize its cash resources on behalf of its foreign subsidiaries  thereby mitigating foreign currency conversion risks
