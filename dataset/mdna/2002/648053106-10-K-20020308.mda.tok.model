item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
certain of these leases provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
rental income also includes lease termination fees 
the company must make estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivables related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income  because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income

revenue recognition provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
real estate land  buildings and building and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ordinary repairs and maintenance  are expensed as incurred 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings to years building improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
for example  if the company were to lengthen the expected useful life of a particular building improvement  the improvement would be depreciated over more years  resulting in less depreciation expense and higher net income on an annual basis 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
for investments accounted for under the equity method  a loss is recognized if the loss in value of the investment is other than temporary 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because taking an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for segments of a business to be disposed of 
this statement does retain the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
this statement also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily controlled subsidiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the impact of the adoption of this statement to be material

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value as issued 
sfas no 
was effective january   however  sfas  deferral of the effective date of sfas  extended the effective date for the company to january the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  this new accounting standard requires companies to carry all derivative instruments  including certain embedded derivatives  in the statement of financial condition at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
the company uses only qualifying hedges that are designated specifically to reduce exposure to interest rate risk by locking in the expected future cash payments on certain liabilities 
this is typically accomplished using an interest rate swap 
for financial reporting purposes  the gain or loss on the interest rate swap is recorded as a component of equity 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in january  the company recorded a net transition adjustment of  in accumulated other comprehensive income equity at that time 
adoption of the standard also resulted in the company recognizing  of derivative instrument liabilities 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period

the mall at rd street  a property owned by ert  had a decrease in net income of million for the six months ended june  rental and other revenue decreased million because of redevelopment activities  partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and bad debt expense 
pointe orlando  a property owned by ert  had a decrease in net loss of million primarily due to a decrease in legal costs 
foreign currency loss increased million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in this increase reflects the continued weakening of the value of the canadian dollar 
expenses total expenses decreased million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the major areas of change are discussed below 
operating costs increased million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the increase was due to the consolidation of the ert properties  which accounted for million of the increase  and million from the acquired properties  partially offset by a million decrease from clearwater and million decrease from the sold properties 
the balance of the increase of million was due to increases in insurance  personnel  landscaping  maintenance and higher utility costs  partially offset by decreases in snow removal and promotional costs 
real estate and other taxes decreased million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the reduction is a result of million from clearwater  million from property dispositions and decreases in tax rates and property assessments associated with ongoing appeals 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million relating to acquisitions and the ert properties 
interest expense decreased million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in approximately million of the decrease is due to lower interest rates and a decrease in the company s debt portfolio due to payoffs from property dispositions 
the decrease was partially offset by interest expense of million on pointe orlando  a retail property owned by ert

results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and revenues rental income decreased by million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in between january  and december   six retail shopping centers were acquired 
these acquisitions produced revenue increases of approximately million 
during the same period  the company sold all or a portion of properties which accounted for revenue reductions of million

lease settlement income declined million 
the balance of the change in revenue was a decrease of million 
interest  dividend and other income increased by approximately million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in this increase was due primarily to interest income of million earned primarily from ert and the company s development projects 
the decrease in equity participation in ert  from a loss of million in the twelve months ended december  to a loss of million in the twelve months ended december   was primarily the result of factors relating to the two operating mall properties the mall at rd street and pointe orlando  a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense 
the mall at rd street  a property owned by ert  had a reduction in net income of approximately million 
this was due primarily to a reduction in rental revenue of million because of redevelopment plans  lease settlement income of million received in the prior period  which did not recur in the current period  offset by higher interest income of approximately million  and an increase in the bad debt expense of million and lower operating expenses of approximately million 
pointe orlando  a mall in florida  which in three quarters of the prior year was accounted for using the equity method when ert was a owner  has been owned and consolidated with ert since october  the effect of owning of pointe orlando for the full year of increased the loss to ert by an additional million to million 
pointe orlando had an increased loss in the twelve months ended december  of approximately million 
this was due primarily to lower revenues of million  increased litigation costs of million relating to a legal action revolving around the construction and delayed opening of the mall and an increase in bad debt expense of approximately million 
these items were offset by lower operating costs of million and lower interest expense of million 
ert had a decrease in interest income of approximately million  or  due primarily to the acquisition and consolidation of pointe orlando and the elimination of the interest income charged to the previously unconsolidated entity 
ert s interest expense to new plan excel increased million due to higher borrowings by ert and this was the primary reason for the million increase in interest  dividend and other income of the company 
foreign currency loss increased million due to the decline in value of the canadian dollar 
expenses total expenses increased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the major areas of increase were real estate and other taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in operating  bad debt and non recurring expenses 
interest expense increased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in  due primarily to increased borrowings in connection with stock repurchases  property acquisitions and improvements  and additional investments in ert 
real estate and other taxes increased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in approximately million of the increase was due to a one time recovery of prior year s expense in  which did not occur again in the remaining amount of approximately million was due to higher property tax expenses primarily in the retail portfolio 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the primary reason for the increase was the improvements to real estate put in place in and and the increase of real estate assets due to additional allocation of purchase price from the merger with excel realty trust  inc  in the prior year 
the net impact of the acquisitions and dispositions during the periods was a reduction of million 
provision for doubtful accounts decreased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in due to the collection of amounts previously thought to be uncollectible and improved collection experience 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for bad debts at the clearwater mall 
severance costs declined million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the million severance charges in were primarily payments made to certain former officers in connection with their resignation or retirement from the company and their respective retirement and employment agreements 
in the prior year  the million expense was the result of the resignation of seven former excel realty trust  inc executives and the payments made to them in accordance with their employment agreements 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in as a percentage of total assets  administrative expense decreased to from 
as a percent of total revenues  costs increased to from 
the major reason for the increase was related to increases in personnel costs 
gains on the sale of assets gains on the sale of real estate increased million  or 
in  the company sold retail and one commercial property resulting in a gain of million 
in  five retail properties were sold  resulting in a gain of million  and two residential properties were sold for a gain of million 
impairment of real estate the estimated fair value of certain properties classified as real estate held for sale was less than the book value of these properties 
this resulted in an impairment of real estate expense of million for the year 
of this impairment  million is related to real estate held for sale during the year which is now held for use as of december  there was no impairment of real estate in extraordinary income during the year there was a prepayment of a mortgage payable which had an unamortized mortgage premium associated with it 
the elimination of this premium resulted in the extraordinary income of million 
there was no extraordinary income in funds from operations the company calculates funds from operations ffo as net income attributable to common shareholders on a diluted basis before gain or loss on sales of real estate and securities and before extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate  amortized leasing commission costs and the minority interest share of income 
effective january   the company adopted the nareit definition of ffo which requires the inclusion of both recurring and non recurring results of operations and the exclusion of extraordinary items 
the calculations have been restated to conform to the nareit definition to include non recurring charges 
the nareit definition of ffo excludes discontinued operations  however  the company has included discontinued operations in its calculation 
ffo is not a substitute for cash flows from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo is presented because industry analysts and the company consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of performance of reits 
the following information is provided to show the items included in the company s ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands year year year ended ended ended december  december  december  net income before extraordinary item preferred dividends minority interest net income applicable to common shareholders diluted gains loss on real estate and securities preferred a dividends depreciation amortization  including depreciation relating to equity investments impairment of real estate funds from operations weighted average of common shares outstanding diluted net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities series a preferred stock has a dilutive effect on the ffo calculation 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had approximately million in available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that the company will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet its liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
short term liquidity needs the company s short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with its portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on its outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and quarterly dividends that the company pays to its common and preferred stockholders 
historically  the company has satisfied these requirements principally through cash generated from operations 
the company believes that cash generated from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet its short term liquidity requirements  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flow 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from tenants under existing leases at its properties 
the company s operating cash flow therefore depends materially on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
the company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests primarily grocery anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic living essentials such as food and soft goods  even in difficult economic times 
however  general economic downturns  or economic downturns in one or more markets in which the company owns properties  still may adversely impact the ability of the company s tenants to make lease payments and the company s ability to re lease space as leases expire on favorable terms 
in either of these cases  the company s cash flow would be adversely affected 
as a general matter  the company believes that the current economic downturn in the united states generally has not had a material adverse effect on its performance thus far 
however  continuation of the current downturn could negatively impact the company s operating results in  depending on the magnitude and length of the downturn 
on january   kmart corporation  the company s largest tenant  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
prior to the bankruptcy filing  the company leased space at of its shopping centers to kmart 
kmart has since rejected the leases at two locations 
an additional two locations are subleased or assigned to third parties 
the remaining kmart locations  all of which currently are physically occupied  contain a total of million square feet of gross leasable area  or approximately of the company s total gross leasable area 
as of december   kmart s annualized base rent for these locations was million  or approximately per square foot  which represented of the company s total annualized base rent 
in addition  three of the shopping centers acquired in the portfolio acquisition as defined below contain kmart stores 
as of december   on a pro forma basis and excluding the two leases which kmart has already rejected and the two subleased or assigned locations  kmart s annualized base rent for the locations was approximately million  or approximately per square foot  which would represent approximately of the company s total annualized base rent 
under federal bankruptcy laws  kmart can affirm or reject its remaining leases with the company 
it could also seek to receive rent reductions or deferrals or other lease modifications from the company 
at this time  kmart has not announced its plans with respect to the remaining leases with the company  although the company is currently in discussions with kmart regarding certain of these lease locations 
in event that leases are terminated  the company would seek to re lease those spaces to new tenants 
in some cases  the company believes it could re lease the space currently occupied by kmart on terms that would be at least as favorable as the current lease terms with kmart 
in other cases  however  the company may not be able to achieve rental rates that kmart currently is paying 
it also may take a significant amount of time to re lease any space vacated by kmart during which period the company would not be collecting any rent for that space 
in addition  if kmart terminates additional leases with the company  other tenants at the affected properties may have the right to terminate their leases with the company  or to pay less rent than they currently pay 
if kmart terminates a substantial number of leases with the company  or if kmart receives substantial rent reductions or deferrals  it will adversely affect the company s rental revenues  and the impact may be material 
in addition  kmart s termination of leases or closure of stores could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers  the impact of which could be material to the company 
the company does not believe that there are any other tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect the company s rental revenues 
in addition  in march the company acquired a portfolio of retail properties the portfolio acquisition  which increases the net rentable area of the company s properties by more than 
as a result of this acquisition  the company will incur substantial additional expenses that are attributable to the operation of these properties 
the company also assumed or incurred approximately an additional million of debt to finance the transaction 
while the company believes that the cash generated by these newly acquired properties will more than offset the operating expenses and interest expense associated with these properties  it is possible that these properties may not perform as well as expected  and as a result the company s cash needs may increase 
in addition  there may be other additional costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of these properties  such as increased general and administrative costs while the company assimilates such a large number of properties into its operating system 
the company expects to spend approximately million in to complete its million deferred maintenance program that began in the company believes that completing this maintenance enhances the competitiveness of its properties 
the company expects to pay for these maintenance projects out of excess cash from operations or  to the extent necessary  draws on its revolving credit facilities 
the company also regularly incurs significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of its retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
the company expects to pay for these capital expenditures out of excess cash from operations or  to the extent necessary  draws on its revolving credit facilities 
the company believes that a significant portion of these expenditures are recouped in the form of continuing lease payments 
the company has established a stock repurchase program under which it may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock from time to time through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   approximately  shares have been repurchased under this program at an average purchase price of per share 
approximately  shares were repurchased in at an average purchase price of per share 
in light of the current trading price of the company s common stock  the company does not anticipate effecting additional stock repurchases in the near future  although market conditions could cause the company to reevaluate this determination at any time 
the company has also established a repurchase program under which it may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding preferred stock and public debt from time to time through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   no purchases have been made under this program 
the current quarterly dividend on the company s common stock is per share 
the company also pays regular quarterly dividends on its preferred stock 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of directors  the ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of the company s taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
in addition  under the company s existing credit facilities  the company generally is restricted from paying common stock dividends that would exceed of the company s funds from operations during any four quarter period 
long term liquidity needs the company s long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of the company s long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at the company s properties  redevelopment projects that the company undertakes at its properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that the company pursues 
historically  the company has satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common stock and preferred stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets and repayment by third parties of notes receivable 
the company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on the company s access to these capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including its degree of leverage  the value of its unencumbered assets  its credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  the company has investment grade credit ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from two major rating agencies standard poor s bbb  rating affirmed and moody s investor service baa  review for possible downgrade 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in the company s financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rate currently payable under the company s existing credit facilities  it likely would increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and it potentially could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain future financing 
based on management s internal evaluation of the company properties  the estimated value of the company s properties is well above the outstanding amount of mortgage debt encumbering the properties 
therefore  at this time  the company believes that additional financing could be obtained  either in the form of mortgage debt or additional unsecured borrowings  and without violating the financial covenants contained in the company s unsecured debt instruments 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of common stock and preferred stock is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and the current trading price of the company s stock 
during  and the early part of  conditions in the equity market for reits were not attractive  and as a result the company did not issue any new equity securities during this time 
in the second half of  market conditions improved  and in january  the company sold  shares of common stock in a public offering that raised net proceeds of approximately million 
the company will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to it at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 
the company has selectively effected asset sales to generate cash proceeds over the last two years 
in particular  in september the company sold its portfolio of apartment properties and generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
also in  the company sold or monetized other assets that raised an additional million in gross proceeds 
the company s ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
the company s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
the following table summarizes all of the company s long term contractual cash obligations  excluding interest  to pay third parties as of december  in thousands contractual cash obligations thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total long term debt includes scheduled amortization and scheduled maturities for mortgage loans  notes payable and credit facilities 
as shown in the table above  a significant portion of the company s long term debt matures in less than one year 
the company has two revolving credit facilities with the bank of new york as lead lender  under which the company may borrow up to million in uncollateralized advances from a group of banks 
the company also has a term loan with fleet national bank as lead lender  under which it has borrowed million  on an unsecured basis  as of december  in addition  on march   the company entered into an additional term loan with fleet national bank as lead lender  under which it has borrowed million on an unsecured basis 
the table below sets forth certain terms of the loans under these four facilities collectively  the credit facilities 
amount available to be drawn amount drawn as of in december  current interest loan thousands in thousands rate maturity date bny revolving facility  libor plus bp october bny revolving facility   libor plus bp november fleet term loan   libor plus bp may fleet term loan  libor plus bp february total the interest rate payable by the company under each of these facilities adjusts depending on the company s credit rating 
if the company s credit rating is lowered  the interest rates increase 
for instance  a decrease in the company s current credit rating by one rating level would cause the interest rate under the bny revolving facility to increase from libor plus basis points bp to libor plus bp  would cause the interest rate under the bny revolving facility to increase from libor plus bp to libor plus bp  and would cause the interest rate under each of the fleet term loans to increase from libor plus bp to libor plus bp 
the maturity date for the fleet term loan can be extended to november at the company s option 
the fleet term loan was entered into in march  and therefore no amount was outstanding as of december  the entire amount of the loan was drawn in march in addition to the credit facilities  the company had approximately million of mortgage debt outstanding as of december  having a weighted average interest rate of and million of notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 
because the credit facilities are nearing their maturity  the company currently is in preliminary negotiations with certain major financial institutions for a new revolving credit facility 
the company expects this facility to be in place by the end of the second quarter of this year  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
if the company is not successful in obtaining a new credit facility  it does not have sufficient funds on hand to pay off amounts that are scheduled to come due under the credit facilities

for a discussion of other factors which may adversely affect the company s liquidity and capital resources  please see the section titled risk factors in item i of the company s annual report on form k 
inflation the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise but may be adversely impacted by tenant sales decreases  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  the company believes that many of its existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental such rates may be increased to or get closer to current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of such leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding floating rate mortgages 
in addition  the company had million outstanding as of december  in connection with floating rate borrowings under credit facilities 
the company does not believe that the interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt is material as of that date in relation to the approximately million of outstanding total debt of the company  the approximately billion of total assets of the company and the approximately billion market capitalization of the company s common stock as of that date 
in addition  as discussed below  the company has fixed million of floating rate borrowings through the use of an interest rate swap 
the company was a party to one hedging agreement with respect to its floating rate debt as of december  on october   the company entered into a two year swap agreement with fleet national bank relating to million of the company s variable rate debt 
as a result of the company s sale of its garden apartment community portfolio  the swap agreement was reduced from million to million 
the agreement effectively fixes the annual interest rate of this debt at a base rate of plus applicable spreads associated with the company s variable rate credit facilities 
hedging agreements enable the company to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities 
hedging agreements expose the company to the risk that the counterparties to such agreements may not perform  which could increase the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  however  the counterparties to hedging agreements that the company enters into are major financial institutions 
the company may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits of existing hedging agreements or any hedging agreements that the company may enter into in the future  would increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and the ability of the company to service its debt 
future decreases in interest rates will increase the company s interest expense as compared to the floating rate debt underlying the company s hedging agreements and could result in the company making payments to unwind such agreements 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt increase by or approximately basis points  the increase in annual interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of the company s total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt decrease by or approximately basis points  the decrease in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million
