under the agreement microsoft is obligated to pay us a total of million in license fees over a three year period ending august license revenue from the microsoft agreement was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and is expected to be million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
over the three year period  microsoft has also agreed to spend million per year and pay us an additional million per year to market joint solutions of the parties

restructuring charge during the quarter ended june   we recorded a restructuring charge of  related to workforce redundancies at netiq resulting from the webtrends merger and the resizing of the combined businesses 
a total of employees were terminated under this plan  of which were in research and development and were in sales and marketing 
during fiscal and   and  respectively  were paid out as termination benefits and there is no remaining liability at june  tender offer on may  we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our non executive employees 
under the program  employees were given the opportunity to cancel outstanding stock options previously granted to them in exchange for an equal number of new options to be granted at a future date 
the exchange was limited to employees who held options with an exercise price equal to or greater than per share 
options for a total of  shares were tendered by employees under the program 
new options for a total of  shares were granted on december  at 
table of contents employee stock options our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our option program critical to our operation and productivity  essentially all of our employees participate in our option plan 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan under which employees are entitled to purchase a limited number of shares at of fair market value 
currently we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which prescribes that no compensation expense be recognized for options granted to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
however  presently there is discussion of implementing new accounting rules that would require us to change the way we account for such options that may result in our reporting operating expense for these non cash costs 
we believe it is important for shareholders to have relevant information regarding the cost of our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and how such plans impact the company and may impact our reported results 
the following table reflects the amortization expense of options granted pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans using i the black scholes model  ii the black scholes model but excluding options that are out of the money based on the average price during the fiscal year  as compared with iii the intrinsic value actually realized by employees at the date of exercise of their options black scholes valuation year granted total prior black scholes valuation in the money options only year granted total prior actual value realized year granted total prior our conclusion is that the black scholes model does not accurately reflect the value of options in the proper period  and likely not at all 
employees who were granted options prior to our initial public offering ipo at the beginning of fiscal realized the greatest actual value since that time million  compared to a black scholes fair value of million for the same periods 
substantially less value has been realized by employees who were granted options subsequent to our ipo million for years through combined  compared to the black scholes value of million 
the public stock markets have declined substantially from the time many options were granted to our employees and at june   of our employee stock options have no value as measured by the difference between market price and option strike price 
therefore  we have also shown a computation for black scholes valuation  excluding those options that are out of the money at the end of each fiscal year

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended june  and total revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing growth of 
software license revenue 
software license revenue increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing growth of 
the increase is primarily due to a million increase in the revenue received from microsoft during fiscal and the inclusion of the operations of webtrends for all of fiscal service revenue 
service revenue increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing growth of 
the increase was primarily due to additional maintenance fees associated with new software licenses  renewals by our existing customers  and the inclusion of the operations of webtrends for all of fiscal service revenue increased in absolute terms due to the compounding effect of our base of installed licenses  a significant majority of our customers renewing their maintenance service agreements and inclusion of a greater amount of implementation service and subscription revenue from the webtrends operations 
we expect our service revenue to grow as a percentage of total revenue as the license revenue from microsoft decreases  our installed base increases  and existing customers renew maintenance contracts 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
cost of software license revenue 
our cost of software license revenue includes the costs associated with software packaging  documentation such as user manuals and cds  and production  as well as non employee commissions and royalties 
cost of software license revenue was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing of related software license revenue in both years 
the increase in dollar amount is due to the increase in software license revenue including the operations of webtrends 
we expect our cost of software license revenue to increase as a percentage of total software license revenue in the future as the revenue from microsoft declines 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing telephonic support  on site consulting services  and training services 
costs associated with training consist principally of labor and travel expenses as well as training materials 
cost of service revenue was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of related service revenue in each year 
the decline in service gross margins is primarily attributable to the addition of the webtrends customer base  which requires more implementation services than our traditional customers  and includes higher cost operations relating to the subscription revenue from webtrends live 
we expect service revenue to increase as our installed license base grows and  as a consequence  our cost of service revenue to increase in absolute dollars 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries and employee commissions  and expenses relating to travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  marketing programs  trade shows  and lead generation activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in dollar amount was due primarily to hiring additional field sales and support  inside sales and marketing personnel  which increased to people from people at the end of each year  and expanding our sales infrastructure to support third party channel partners 
sales and marketing expenses represented and of total revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally the result of revenue increases from microsoft which does not require significant sales or marketing efforts 
we expect to continue hiring additional sales personnel and to increase promotion  advertising  
table of contents and other marketing expenditures in the future 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
excluding microsoft license revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the more difficult selling environment 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  as well as facilities costs  consulting fees  and depreciation 
in addition  costs associated with product management activities  which consist primarily of personnel related costs involved in product design and competitive analysis  are included in research and development for all periods 
these expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and  of total revenue in each year  respectively 
this increase in dollar amount resulted principally from increases in engineering and technical writing personnel  which increased to people from people at the end of each year 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  as our software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility 
our strategy since signing the license agreement with microsoft in september has been to increase spending in research and development 
as a result  we are now bringing to market a significant number of new products 
in fiscal we expect research and development spending to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance and administration  as well as directors and officers insurance  and professional services expenses such as legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount was primarily due to increased staffing necessary to manage and support our growth and the inclusion of million associated with a warrant issued to an executive search firm in march for recruiting services in connection with our new chief executive officer 
general and administrative personnel increased to from at the end of each fiscal year 
the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was due primarily to the growth in total revenue 
we allocate costs associated with facilities and information systems to all functional groups 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase over time in absolute dollars as we expand our administrative staff  add new financial and accounting systems  pay increased directors and officers insurance premiums  and pay increased professional fees to manage our growth 
employee stock based compensation 
deferred employee stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of options assumed in the acquisition of webtrends and costs related to the grant of options at less than fair market value 
the deferred amount is being amortized over the vesting periods of the assumed and granted options  which is generally four years 
due to employee attrition   and  of deferred employee stock based compensation was reversed during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recognized employee stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
the increase in the amortization is due to the deferred employee stock based compensation related to the acquisition of webtrends in march that is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options assumed in the acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
during fiscal and fiscal  we amortized million and million of the goodwill and intangibles recognized in our acquisitions 
we expect to amortize approximately million of intangibles during fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful 
table of contents lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously recognized goodwill  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning july  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 we stopped the amortization of goodwill with an expected net carrying value of million at the date of adoption 
goodwill has been increased to reflect the reclassification of million relating to acquired assembled workforce  net of income taxes of million 
additionally  based on a transitional impairment review related to the carrying value of goodwill we will record a one time  non cash charge of approximately million on july   as a change in accounting principle 
write off of acquired in process research and development costs 
related to our acquisition of webtrends in fiscal we wrote off a total of million in fiscal as charges to operations associated with the purchase of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
other income  net 
other income  net  represents interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  and equity in the loss of our long term investment that is being accounted for on the equity method 
for fiscal and fiscal  other income  net  was million and million  respectively 
despite increases in cash balances  decreases in total other income resulted from decreases in investment yields in and our proportionate share of the loss of our affiliate lumigent technologies in the amount of  income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while showing a net loss  largely due to the non deductibility of the goodwill amortization for income tax purposes 
the tax benefit associated with dispositions from employee stock plans reduced federal and certain state income taxes currently payable to zero in fiscal and comparison of fiscal years ended june  and total revenue 
total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing growth of

the decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally the result of economies of scale resulting from the increased number of sales transactions  including follow on sales to existing customers  as well as the allocation of marketing expenses over a substantially increased revenue base  and the increase in revenues from microsoft which does not require significant sales or marketing efforts 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and  of total revenue in each fiscal year

related to our acquisition of webtrends in fiscal and mission critical and sirana in fiscal we wrote off a total of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as charges to operations associated with the purchase of in process technology that had yet not reached technological feasibility 
in connection with the acquisitions of webtrends in march  mission critical in may  and sirana in march  we acquired technology consisting of both existing technology and in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired technology was made by applying the income forecast method  which considers the present value of free cash flows by product lines 
the key elements of the acquired companies development process include design of user interface  developing code  integration with existing products  
table of contents technical documentation  and testing 
a project is considered to be technologically feasible when a prototype is available for beta or general release 
at the date of acquisition  additional research and development effort was anticipated prior to the release of the products under development 
value was allocated to in process research and development based on the discounted cash flow expected to be generated and considering the core technology resident in the in process products  the acquired companies past experience with typical product life cycles  and expected demand from the acquired companies customers for new products 
acquired in process technologies were charged to operations  as the technologies did not have alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition 
restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a restructuring charge of  related to redundancies and a reduction in force  resulting from the webtrends merger and the resizing of the combined businesses 
a total of employees were terminated under this plan  of which were in research and development and were in sales and marketing

the tax benefit associated with dispositions from employee stock plans reduced federal and certain state income taxes currently payable to zero in fiscal and fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant estimates involving management s judgment 
the critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from licensing software and providing services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as promulgated by statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in accordance with these statements  revenue is recognized upon generally meeting each of the following criteria existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
persuasive evidence is generally a written purchase order  license agreement or contract  delivery of product and authorization keys 
delivery has occurred when media containing the software is shipped or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the software  and the authorization keys are shipped or made available to the customer electronically  fee is fixed or determinable 
a fee is deemed to be fixed and determinable when it is not subject to subsequent refund or adjustment 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when the amounts become due and payable  
table of contents collection is deemed probable within six months of transaction date  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
software revenue is recognized using the residual method under which revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement  but may not exist for one or more of the delivered elements 
revenue is allocated to each element based on relative fair values 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price generally charged when the element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered elements does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized when fair value can be established for all undelivered elements or when all such elements are delivered 
service revenue includes maintenance revenue  usage and subscription based revenue from our webtrends live product  consulting  and training services 
generally  sales made through distributors  resellers  and original equipment manufacturers are recognized at the time these partners report that they have sold the software or  alternatively  when we drop ship the product to the end user  and after all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales made to master distributors of web analytics products are recognized when sold to the master distributor  as sell through information is not available for those sales 
additionally  distributor inventory levels are monitored and a reserve for potential sales returns is provided 
when licenses and services are sold together  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fee is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization of the software and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was sold 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  license and the related service revenue are recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations 
deferred revenue license revenue is deferred when the criteria noted above are not met for revenue recognition purposes 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
advance payments for our webtrends live services are deferred and revenue is recognized based on customer usage  generally page views 
deferred consulting and training revenues are recognized as those services are performed 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates made in the accompanying financial statements are allowance for uncollectible accounts we provide for the allowance for uncollectible accounts as part of our general and administrative expenses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an analysis of the remaining accounts receivable 
the actual write offs for uncollectible accounts in fiscal were  and the allowance was reduced by  which resulted in a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
in the future  if our actual collections are significantly different compared to our assumptions it would result in an additional charge or decrease in our general and administrative expenses 
sales returns reserve we provide a reserve for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns 
revenue is recognized net of the provision for sales returns 
in fiscal we increased our reserve for sales returns by million  reducing revenues commensurately  and recorded million as a reduction of that 
table of contents reserve for product returns 
if the actual future returns are different from our estimates  it would result in a decrease or increase in our revenue 
goodwill and other intangible assets in the historical results presented in this report  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations have been amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
in future periods we will no longer amortize goodwill pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
on july  we evaluate the net realizable value of goodwill and other intangible assets periodically based on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  budgets  and economic projections 
our evaluation also considers non financial data such as market trends  customer relationships  product development cycles  and changes in management s market emphasis 
adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are made whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we adopted sfas no 
effective july   and accordingly  beginning in fiscal we will no longer amortize goodwill  but instead periodically test it for impairment 
see additional discussion under effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
facility reserve we lease approximately  square feet of office space under five year leases expiring in and in portland  oregon 
in september  we determined that we would not need a portion of this space for our operations in the foreseeable future 
the quarterly rent for the unused space is approximately  based on management s assessment of market conditions  including the time required to sub lease the facility  a liability of  was accrued in the quarter ended september  and an additional  was accrued in the quarter ended june  if we are unable to sub lease the facility we will be required to expense up to an additional million  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space under a five year lease expiring june in santa clara  california 
in fiscal upon the acquisition of our headquarters building in san jose  california we determined that we would not need this space for our operations in the foreseeable future 
the quarterly rent for the unused space is approximately  based on management s assessment of market conditions  including the time required to sub lease the facility a liability of million was accrued in fiscal and an additional  was accrued in fiscal the remaining accrual of  at june  represents the company s total remaining liability under the agreement 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes the amount currently payable and changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if we do not generate sufficient income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be recognized 
substantially all of the valuation allowance is attributable to the tax benefit of disqualifying dispositions of stock options and will be credited to equity when realized 
the valuation allowance has been established to fully reserve these deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation of future stock options exercises 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously recognized goodwill  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year 
table of contents beginning july  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 we stopped the amortization of goodwill with an expected net carrying value of million at the date of adoption and goodwill has been increased to reflect the reclassification of million relating to acquired assembled workforce  net of income taxes of million 
additionally  based on a transitional impairment review related to the carrying value of goodwill we will record a one time  non cash charge of approximately million on july   as a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas no 
on july  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized

in fiscal we used cash of million to purchase the company s treasury stock under a board authorized program for stock repurchases of up to million 
other uses of cash were principally for the repayment of our short term and long term debt of million in fiscal 
table of contents long term obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands operating lease payments commitment under technology purchase agreement also  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our obligations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments  and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources  however  we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
factors that may affect future operating results the following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons  some of which are beyond our control 
these fluctuations may result in volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future due to revenue fluctuations caused by many factors 
those factors include general economic conditions and the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing practices  it budgets  and budget cycles  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us  our competitors  and our platform vendors such as microsoft  resulting in purchase deferrals by our customers in anticipation of new products  competitive conditions in the industry  including new products  product announcements  and special pricing offered by our competitors  our success in introducing new products and enhancements  and the timing of their release  our ability to complete specific sales transactions in a given quarter or fiscal year  and the nature of the fee charged whether it is for a perpetual license or a periodic fee for a subscription or service 
we have experienced seasonality in our license bookings  with the fourth quarter of our fiscal year typically having the largest volume of bookings in each fiscal year 
we believe that this seasonality results from the 
table of contents budgeting and work cycles of our customers and from the structure of our direct sales commission program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
as a consequence  we have typically increased backlog in june and december quarters and have decreased backlog in september and march quarters  resulting in more moderate fluctuations in our reported license revenue 
in addition  the risk of quarterly fluctuations relative to our expectations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our revenues  typically between and  has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
many customers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter and many enterprise customers negotiate licenses near the end of the quarter 
in part  this is because these customers believe that they are able to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
while we have traditionally focused on sales of our products to workgroups and divisions of a customer  we are increasingly making enterprise sales  resulting in a sales cycle ranging between and days 
in addition  in recent quarters we have experienced longer financial and purchasing review cycles from many of our customers  which we believe to be a result of the economic slowdown 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue 
because our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  even a relatively small revenue shortfall can materially impact our short term profitability 
given the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter financial comparisons may not necessarily be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as single indicators of our future operating results and performance 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and we expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate 
the value of an investment in our stock could decline due to the impact of a number of factors upon the market price of our common stock  including growth rate expectations for the technology sector generally  variations in our actual and anticipated operating results and revenues  changes in our earnings estimates by securities analysts  and our failure to meet securities analysts performance expectations 
we face several risks in connection with our license  development and marketing agreement with microsoft 
in september  we licensed a substantial portion of our operations manager technology to microsoft for million  payable over three years 
microsoft may use the technology broadly with respect to windows  but its use is limited with respect to windows nt 
microsoft has used that technology as the basis for its microsoft operations manager or mom product 
we also agreed to provide limited engineering resources for a fee and to develop and market new products  or extended management packs xmps that operate with mom 
we have received significant benefits from the agreement  but it also poses significant risks and challenges  including quarterly license revenue from microsoft has grown over the past several quarters and peaked at million per quarter in the march  june  and september quarters 
through june  we have received million in license revenue from microsoft 
the quarterly payments will decline to million beginning in the quarter ending december  to million in the quarter ending march  to million in the quarter ending june  and will terminate with a payment of million in the quarter ending september we must generate incremental revenue from other sources to maintain overall 
table of contents revenue growth 
should microsoft delay or withhold a scheduled license payment during a quarter  it will materially impact our revenue and profitability in that quarter 
revenue from sales of operations manager and appmanager products may decline until we generate higher levels of revenue from xmps  due to a phasing out of sales of operations manager products and customer concern regarding potential overlap between mom and appmanager 
the faster the rate of customer adoption of mom  the greater the potential loss of revenue from our operations manager and appmanager products 
although such adoption may increase our opportunity to earn additional revenue from licenses of xmps  such additional revenue may not be sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from our operations manager and appmanager products  and we must also prepare for potential competition from microsoft and other systems management providers for any new xmp that we may create 
we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth rates we have previously experienced 
most of our revenue growth in the past year has come from our agreement with microsoft and the acquisition of webtrends 
excluding revenues from microsoft  during fiscal revenues grew only modestly due in part to the continued softness of the us economy and further deterioration in the european economies 
revenue from web analytics products  acquired pursuant to the webtrends acquisition  also declined significantly until december as a result of the collapse in the dot com and managed services markets 
we have used the revenue resulting from our license with microsoft to fund increased development of new products that are coming to market in calendar year revenue resulting from these new products will require greater sales and marketing efforts resulting in higher operating expenses 
however  to maintain profitability we must increase revenue from non microsoft sources while reducing overall operating expenses 
as a consequence  we anticipate that operating profit will decline starting in calendar year until revenues achieved from new products or other sources substantially exceed the revenue decline from microsoft 
we are increasing our reliance on indirect distribution channels as a means of increasing product sales and are increasing our emphasis on international sales made through those channels 
these relationships  both domestically and internationally  are non exclusive and typically are terminable upon short notice 
this strategy presents a number of risks including the ability of resellers or integrators to cease marketing or integrating our products with little or no notice  the ability of our resellers or integrators to market or use competitive products or services from third parties and to promote such third party products or services in preference to ours  the effectiveness of our resellers and integrators in marketing our products  the difficulty in attracting and replacing high quality resellers and integrators  and the potential of conflicts between our direct and indirect sales channels resulting in lost sales and customer confusion or dissatisfaction 
to increase our revenue we also must continue to enhance our existing products and services and continue to develop new products and services to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective customers 
the development of new products and services  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
the market for some of our products is in the early stage of development  and we are recent entrants to such markets and face competition from established competitors 
as is common in new and evolving industries  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and new market entrants are subject to high levels of uncertainty and risk 
furthermore  new products can quickly render obsolete products that were formerly in high demand  which may include products that currently provide us with significant revenue 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
during fiscal  and  we reported net losses of million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with generally 
table of contents accepted accounting practices in the united states of america  stemming principally from amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and other acquisition related charges 
effective july   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and in the quarter ended september   we will record a charge of approximately million reflecting our reduced expectations for cash flows coming from acquired businesses and  as a consequence  we expect to experience continued losses in fiscal we will stop regular amortization of goodwill going forward  but will instead test the goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if we determine that goodwill has become impaired in the future  we will be required to record additional charges 
we have recently experienced several changes in our senior management team 
in january  charles m 
boesenberg joined the company as president and chief executive officer  and on august  was named chairman of the board  in each instance replacing ching fa hwang  a co founder of the company who remains a member of the board 
other changes in senior management in fiscal  include the departures of thomas p 
bernhardt  senior vice president  chief technology officer  and director  who resigned in february  her daw che  co founder of netiq  who resigned in october  and glen boyd and eli shapira  co founders of webtrends  who resigned in august and september  respectively 
mr 
shapira is continuing on our board 
additions to our executive team in fiscal  include dr 
richard schell  chief technology officer and general manager  performance and availability products in june  mark marron  senior vice president worldwide sales in august  and betsy e 
bayha  vice president  general counsel and secretary in november our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to assimilate these changes in our leadership team and to retain the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
we do not have employment contracts for a defined term with our employees  including our executives and key employees 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could harm our business and could affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
failure to manage our growth  improve our infrastructure  and satisfactorily implement new information and fulfillment systems may adversely affect our business 
we have grown rapidly  including through our acquisition of webtrends corporation in march and mission critical in may our growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for our management personnel and the need to effectively manage multiple geographic locations  develop new products that utilize the assets and resources of the combined entities  and to further develop cost effective standards  controls  procedures and policies 
if we do not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our growth  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our growth has resulted in a need to upgrade our operational  financial  and management information systems 
in particular  we need to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems  in order to accommodate our growth on a global basis and to meet the requirements of a changing regulatory environment 
to meet these challenges we implemented a new customer relationship management system in fiscal  and are continuing the process of modifying and refining it to better meet our needs 
as well  we currently are in the process of implementing an enterprise resource planning system 
implementation of these systems will inevitably result in certain disruption of our normal business processes 
while we believe that these systems will enable us to operate more efficiently and will enhance our ability to provide timely and accurate reporting  failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and to successfully operate and support the new systems could materially and adversely impact our business and our operating results 
our growth also has resulted in the need to implement new processes and vendors for the reproduction and distribution of our products 
we presently are in the process of transferring these fulfillment operations to a new 
table of contents third party vendor that will provide fulfillment services from the united states  europe  and japan 
if our new fulfillment system is not successfully and timely implemented  it can result in shipment delays  stoppages  increased costs and errors  and consequent channel and customer dissatisfaction 
changes in accounting regulations could negatively affect market perception of our results and the way we do business 
the accounting rules applicable to our business have undergone significant changes in recent years  and future changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to expensing of employee stock option plans  could cause us to account for our business in ways that may adversely affect our operating results 
as permitted by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  currently we apply accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for options granted to employees where the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
a change in accounting rules that would require us to change the way we account for such options to include a deferred compensation liability on our balance sheet and to include the deemed expense associated with such options in our statement of operations may necessitate our reporting operating losses as a result of these non cash expenses 
in such an event  investor perception of our results of operations may be adversely affected and our stock price may fall 
changes in the way we do business may impact our operating results by changing the manner in which we are required to account for sales 
there have been various changes in the enterprise software business that may impact the manner in which we recognize revenue received from software licensed to our customers 
we currently sell most of our software licenses on a perpetual basis  which enables us to recognize the majority of revenue received in connection with the sale promptly upon consummation of the sale 
however  certain software vendors are moving towards a subscription based model in which periodic fees are charged for use of the software 
if customers increasingly demand that we sell licenses to our software on a subscription basis  or otherwise charge a periodic fee for its use  it will delay our recognition of revenue for that sale and will decrease the revenues attributable to that sale during the reporting period in which the sale is made although the revenue will continue to be recognized in subsequent periods 
if substantial portions of our license sales are converted to a subscription basis  this could materially impact our revenues during the initial quarters in which the change is implemented 
we base a substantial portion of our marketing  sales strategy  and product development on our relationship with microsoft 
we believe that our success in penetrating target markets for our systems management products depends in part on our ability to maintain a strong strategic relationship with microsoft 
our relationship with microsoft is important to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products  and enhance our sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities 
on the other hand  microsoft provides various products and management features that provide competitive and overlapping capabilities to some of the solutions we offer on the microsoft platform  and may expand its presence in this and other markets in the future 
for example  microsoft operations manager provides various manageability capabilities also provided by our appmanager product 
microsoft also may determine to discontinue or diminish our relationship at the conclusion of our current agreement 
we participate with microsoft in a number of joint sales and marketing initiatives 
it is possible that microsoft may decline to participate in joint initiatives in the future 
we also attempt to coordinate our systems management product offerings with the future releases of microsoft s operating systems and software 
it is possible that in the future microsoft may not notify us of feature enhancements to its products prior to new releases of its operating systems or may not provide us with necessary development tools and information or may choose to work more closely with our competitors 
in that case  we may not be able to introduce products on a timely basis that capitalize on new microsoft operating system releases and feature enhancements 

table of contents our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers outside the united states and are continuing to expand our international operations 
we recently have established operations in ireland to provide customer support and shared administrative services for the europe middle east africa region 
we also maintain offices in the united kingdom and japan  as well as a number of other foreign locations  to provide sales and sales support 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including the overlap of different tax regimes  the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices  differing regulatory and legal requirements and employment schemes  and our ability to identify and timely comply with such requirements and schemes  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries  the need to localize and internationalize our products and licensing programs  significant reliance on our distributors and other resellers who do not offer our products exclusively  import and export licensing requirements  including export controls on encryption technology  political and economic instability in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other regions  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
to date  a substantial portion of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  and we have not used risk management techniques or hedged the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the future  if we do not engage in hedging transactions  our results of operations will be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction 
we have in the past and expect in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies  products  services  and technologies 
the risks we commonly encounter in connection with an acquisition include we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy  or that we paid more than what the company or assets are later worth  or economic conditions change  all of which may generate a future impairment charge  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines  there may be customer confusion where our products overlap with those of the acquired company  we may have product liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  
table of contents we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees  and we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies  among other matters 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions 
from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as out of pocket costs 
in addition  should we fail to consummate an acquisition  we may be required to pay a break up fee which will be charged to our costs of operation and we may be exposed to litigation as a consequence of our failure to go forward with the proposed acquisition 
the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also impacts our financial results 
to the extent we pay cash for acquisitions our cash reserves are reduced 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options and other rights  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs such as of acquired in process research and development costs  restructuring charges  and may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment and could result in future impairment charges 
our restructurings may result in management distraction  customer uncertainty  and increased costs 
in we restructured much of our sales force  both direct and indirect  as we do periodically  in response to factors such as management changes  product changes  performance issues  and other business considerations 
this may result in a temporary distraction of management or operational disruption  with some negative impact on customer service 
in fiscal and we terminated a small percentage of our employees as a consequence of restructuring activity  resulting in the payment of severance compensation and the assertion of claims by certain employees alleging that the termination of their employment was unlawful 
to the extent we engage in any future restructuring  we anticipate having to incur additional charges 
we face competition from a number of existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  which could result in loss of market share and diminished profits 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including customers internal information technology departments that develop or integrate system and application monitoring tools for their particular needs  application vendors who bundle management solutions with their products  providers of network and systems management framework products such as computer associates international  inc  hewlett packard company  and international business machines corporation  providers of performance and availability management solutions such as bmc software  inc  concord communications  inc  and precise software solutions  ltd  vendors of internet servers  operating systems  and networking hardware 
in particular  microsoft corporation  oracle corporation  sun microsystems  inc  and others that bundle systems management solutions with their products  providers of administration products such as quest software  inc and bindview corporation  providers of security solutions such as internet security systems  inc  network associates technology  inc  symantec corporation  and bindview corporation  
table of contents providers of hosted web analytics solutions such as websidestory  inc  providers of ebusiness intelligence solutions such as accrue software  inc and the netgenesis products from spss inc  and web management service providers and vendors  such as consulting firms  web design firms  internet audit firms  site management vendors  internet service providers  and independent software vendors 
in the future potential competitors may bundle their products with products similar to ours  or incorporate functionality into existing products that renders certain of our products unmarketable or obsolete 
in addition  our ability to sell our products depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  such as operating systems and messaging  internet and database applications 
some of these third party software developers may change their products so that they compete with our products or are no longer compatible with our products 
any of the foregoing could lead to price reductions or a potential loss of sales of the affected products 
errors in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products 
because our software products are complex  they may contain errors  or bugs  that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
these errors could materially and adversely affect our business reputation  result in significant costs to us  and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product errors may be substantial and could decrease our profit margins 
while we expect to continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct bugs  errors in our products may be found in the future 
because it is difficult to simulate the highly complex computing environments in which our customers use our products and because of the increasing functionality of our product offerings  testing may be complicated and fail to identify all errors 
moreover  because our products support and interoperate with third party operating systems and applications  any errors or bugs in that software may result in errors in the performance of our products and may require cooperation from the third party to resolve 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 
errors in our software also may result in expensive and time consuming litigation  and the potential award of substantial damages 
while our software license agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages for errors in our software  there is no assurance that such limitations and disclaimers will be enforced by a court or other tribunal or will otherwise effectively protect us from such claims 
this is particularly true with respect those of our products licensed under shrink wrap or clickwrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees  but also may apply to negotiated license agreements 
we presently carry errors and omissions insurance against such claims  but there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses as a result of bugs or errors or will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
natural disasters or other incidents may affect our network and data centers or otherwise disrupt our business 
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure for internal communications  communications with customers and partners  direct sales of our software products  sales lead generation and direct provision of fee based services 
that infrastructure  as well as our other facilities  is vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other utility failures  fire  earthquake  flood  sabotage  vandalism and similar events 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other incident could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage 
in addition  failure of any of our telecommunications providers to provide consistent data communications capacity  including as a result of business failure  could result in interruptions in our services and disruption of our business operations 
any of the foregoing could impact our 
table of contents provision of services and fulfillment of product  and our ability to process product orders and invoices and otherwise timely conduct our business operations 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our success is heavily dependent on proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our products and services 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
we presently have issued patents in the united states  pending patent applications in the united states  and pending patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  these patents may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
as well  despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our current or future products or to independently develop similar or superior technology or design around the patents we own 
policing unauthorized use and transfer of our software is difficult and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in licensing our products  other than in enterprise license transactions  we typically rely on shrink wrap or clickwrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
such licenses may be unenforceable  in whole or in part  under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation would be costly and potentially distracting to management  and there is no assurance that we will be successful in such litigation 
third parties could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
such claims could injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights  and these claims  whether they have merit or not  could harm our business by increasing our costs or reducing our revenue 
such claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may discourage future customers from purchasing our products 
the intensely competitive nature of our industry and the importance of technology to our competitors businesses may enhance the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature 
any such claims  even if without merit  could be time consuming  result in potentially significant litigation costs or damages  cause product shipment delays and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 
such claims could also force us either to stop selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign those products or services that incorporate such technology 
we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the sale or use of  our products 
certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we also expect that we may incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our software shipments 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 

table of contents we have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a change in control of the company that a stockholder may consider favorable 
we have a classified board of directors  with staggered  three year terms  that may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors 
in addition  certain of our officers are parties to a change of control agreement or other agreements with the company  which provide for the acceleration of stock option vesting and the payment of certain compensation in the event such officer s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control 
in addition  our stock plan provides for acceleration of stock option vesting in the event an employee s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control  which may make us a less attractive acquisition candidate for potential acquirors 
compliance with certain regulatory requirements may prove difficult and costly and  should we be unsuccessful  may subject us to penalties 
we are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers  employees and other individuals  especially outside of the united states 
violation of these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transfers  but also to transfers of information between our subsidiaries and ourselves  and between and among ourselves  our subsidiaries and our commercial partners  could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
we consider investments in highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
our business is principally transacted in united states dollars 
in fiscal  of our invoices were in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenue and operating expenses in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  denmark  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  korea  singapore  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
we believe that a natural hedge exists in some local currencies  as local currency denominated revenue will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  as of june   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
at june  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in short term investments 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million
