item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
statements in the following discussion about liveperson that are not historical facts are forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about liveperson and our industry 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future events or results to differ materially from such statements 
any such forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of it is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progress  and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the year 
although these expectations may change  we are under no obligation to inform you if they do 
our company policy is generally to provide our expectations only once per quarter  and not to update that information until the next quarter 
actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the projections or forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in the section captioned risk factors that may affect future results 
subsequent event on february   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market  inc  notifying us that during the preceding consecutive trading days  the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum bid price of per share as required by the nasdaq national market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
the letter stated that we have until may  to demonstrate compliance with such rule and that  if we are not in compliance by that date  nasdaq will notify us that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if such event occurs  we may appeal the decision to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
the letter also stated that we could apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgements that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of collectibility of accounts receivable  the realization of goodwill  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition during  we began offering the liveperson services 
the liveperson services facilitate real time sales and customer service for companies doing business on the internet 
we charge a monthly fee for each operator access account  which we refer to as a seat 
certain of our larger clients  who require more sophisticated implementation and training  also pay an initial non refundable set up fee 
the initial set up fee is intended to recover certain costs principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to the deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over a period of months  representing the estimated term of a client relationship 
although we believe this estimate is reasonable  this estimate may change in the future 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more seats 
unamortized deferred fees  if any  are recognized upon termination of the agreement with the customer 
we recognized  and in  and  respectively  of set up fees due to client attrition 
in the first half of  we began selling the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk by transferring the risk to the credit card provider 
sales executed via internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
sales of the liveperson services via internet download typically have no set up fee  because we do not provide the customer with training and administrative costs are minimal 
we record revenue for traditional direct sales and internet download sales based upon a monthly fee charged for each seat using the liveperson services  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees as services are provided 
our service agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable by either party upon to days notice without penalty 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services via internet download  which are paid for almost exclusively by credit card  which transfers the collection risk to the credit card provider and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  or or of our total accounts receivable in or impairment of long lived assets prior to january   we accounted for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
see recently issued accounting standards for our accounting for long lived assets beginning on january  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  including fixed assets and goodwill  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset to be held and used may not be recoverable  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  including fixed assets and goodwill  will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
restructuring activities restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the emerging issues task force eitf  in connection with eitf issue eitf 
eitf generally requires  with respect to the recognition of severance expenses  management approval of the restructuring plan  the determination of the employees to be terminated and communication of benefit arrangement to employees 
overview liveperson is an application service provider of technology that facilitates real time sales and customer service for companies doing business on the internet 
we offer our proprietary real time interaction technology as outsourced services 
we currently generate revenue from the sale of our liveperson services  which enable our clients to communicate directly with internet users via text based chat  and to a lesser extent from related professional services 
with the liveperson chat service  our clients can respond to internet user inquiries in real time  and can thereby enhance their internet users online shopping experience 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in november  however  we did not commence operations until january we had no significant revenue until  when we began to generate revenue from services primarily related to web based community programming and media design 
in  we shifted our core business focus to the development of the liveperson services and phased out our prior programming efforts  which last generated revenue in december we introduced the liveperson services in november in january  we completed a private placement of  shares of our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock with an affiliate of  and other entities associated with  dell computer corporation and with nbc interactive media  inc a division of nbc at a purchase price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this private placement 
our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock converted  at a two for three ratio  into  shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering on april   together with our other outstanding convertible preferred stock 
in connection with the issuance of our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  we recorded a non cash preferred stock dividend of million  which relates to the beneficial conversion feature associated with such preferred stock 
the amount of this dividend is limited to the gross proceeds received by us in connection with the sale of our series d convertible preferred stock and was recorded in the first quarter of because the series d convertible preferred stock was  at the time it was issued  immediately convertible at the option of the holder 
on april   we consummated our initial public offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock at per share  from which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
on october   we acquired humanclick ltd  a private company organized under the laws of israel 
the purchase price was million  which included the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million and acquisition costs of  in the first quarter of  following a review of our business in connection with our acquisition of humanclick  we commenced restructuring initiatives to streamline our operations  including the consolidation of our two san francisco bay area offices 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people as of the end of the first quarter of in the third quarter of  in a continued effort to streamline our operations  we initiated additional restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions  and the decision to relocate our principal executive offices  which included the termination of an office space lease and the entering into of a new three year lease that commenced in november 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people  the write off of impaired computer equipment and software and the write off of certain furniture  equipment and building improvements 
for the year ended december   we recorded net charges of approximately million for our various restructuring initiatives 
in connection with our third quarter restructuring initiatives  we upgraded all of our clients onto a single software application platform 
we expect this new platform to provide our customers with a more dependable product while reducing our cost of providing these services 
in october  our board of directors determined that it would not effect the one for fifteen reverse split of our common stock approved by our stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders held on september   due to the fact that on september   nasdaq informed us that on such date they had implemented a moratorium on the minimum bid price and market value of public float requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq stock market  which requirements were suspended until january  see also the information above under the caption subsequent event 
as part of our restructuring initiatives  we have consolidated our client base onto a single software application platform and network 
our network is hosted by a third party provider of secure server hosting services located in the united states 
while the cost of providing our services as a result of these initiatives has decreased  we are dependent on our third party server hosting provider for redundant network connections  server maintenance and general security 
we have not experienced any material product instability or operational consequences since the implementation of these initiatives 
we have also consolidated our product development  help desk and online sales personnel in our israel office 
as a result  the political  economic or military conditions affecting israel could have a material adverse effect on our operations in israel or our business

the lack of material increased revenue in the fourth quarter of  and the quarterly revenue declines earlier in the year  were primarily attributable to client attrition from our internet related customers with limited operating histories many of which began to face difficult business conditions in the last three quarters of  and  to a lesser extent  to fewer new clients due to the reduction in our sales force as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
our revenue had increased in each of the five quarters ended march   from  to million  due primarily to increased market acceptance of our services  which was in part attributable to the growth of our direct sales force 
the growth of our sales force had allowed us to solicit more prospective clients and to respond more quickly and effectively to their inquiries 
we recently experienced slower revenue growth rates than in the past and we cannot assure you that we will experience any future revenue growth 
our cost of revenue has decreased in each of the last four quarters  from million to  this decrease is attributable to reduced spending requirements  including the cancellation of operating leases for certain computer equipment that supported our infrastructure  the consolidation of our clients onto a single customer application platform  reduced headcount and lower allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  each as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
prior to restructuring  our cost of revenue had increased in each of the five quarters ended march   from million to million 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of client services personnel and the expansion of our technological infrastructure 
costs associated with the expansion of our technological infrastructure include  but are not limited to  depreciation and payments under our operating leases for certain computer equipment 
our product development costs have generally decreased in each of the last eight quarters  from million to  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in outsourced labor costs and to our restructuring initiatives  which resulted in fewer employees  streamlined operations and reduced spending requirements  including moving software development to our israel office and lower occupancy costs and related overhead 
our sales and marketing costs have generally decreased in each of the last eight quarters  from million to  this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced print advertising expense and to our restructuring initiatives  which resulted in fewer employees  streamlined operations and reduced spending requirements  including lower allocated occupancy costs and related overhead 
general and administrative costs have decreased in each of the last four quarters  from million to  principally due to our restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions and the decision to relocate our principal executive offices  which included the termination of an office space lease 
prior to restructuring  our general and administrative costs had generally increased in each of the five quarters ended march   from million to million  principally due to an increase in the number of employees and related occupancy costs and  to a lesser extent  to professional fees 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is related entirely to our acquisition of humanclick in october prior to october  we did not incur any amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
non cash compensation expense has generally decreased in each of the last eight quarters  from million to  this decrease is due primarily to the reversal of previously recognized amortization of deferred compensation due to the forfeitures of employee stock options associated with employees who voluntarily left liveperson in  as well as employees whose employment was terminated as part of our restructuring initiatives during  and  to a lesser extent  to a lower aggregate amount of amortization recognized because the number of our employees has decreased 
since our restructuring initiatives in  we have experienced substantial decreases in our expenses 
these initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions  the consolidation of all clients onto a single application platform and the decision to relocate our principal executive offices  which included the termination of an office space lease 
although our operating costs have recently decreased  we do not anticipate further material cost savings in the future 
annual revenue in grew at a substantially slower rate than in and  in the second and third quarters of  quarterly revenue decreased  in each case  due primarily to client attrition from our internet related customers with limited operating histories many of which began to face difficult business conditions in the last three quarters of  and  to a lesser extent  to fewer new clients due to the reduction in our sales force as a result of our restructuring initiatives 
we cannot assure you that we will experience any future revenue growth or that we will generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and as a result  you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
revenue with respect to the liveperson services  our clients pay us a monthly fee for each operator access account  which we refer to as a seat 
certain of our larger clients  who require more sophisticated implementation and training  also pay an initial non refundable set up fee 
our set up fee is intended to recover certain costs incurred by us principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over a period of months  representing the estimated expected term of a client relationship 
as a result of recognizing set up fees in this manner  combined with the fact that we have more seats on an aggregate basis than clients  revenue attributable to our monthly service fee for the years ended december  and accounted for and  respectively  of total liveperson services revenue 
in addition  because we expect the aggregate number of seats to continue to grow  and because we typically do not charge a set up fee for sales generated via internet download  we expect the set up fee to represent a decreasing percentage of total revenue over time 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more seats 
our service agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable by either party upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees and professional service fees as services are provided 
professional service fees consist of training provided to customers 
given the time required to schedule training for our clients operators and our clients resource constraints  we have historically experienced a lag between signing a client contract and generating revenue from that client 
this lag has generally ranged from one day to days 
there is no lag for sales generated via internet download  because our services are immediately available and fully functional upon download 
to date  revenue from professional services has not been material 
in the first half of  we began selling the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk by transferring the risk to the credit card provider 
sales executed via internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact which is typically required for traditional direct sales 
sales of the liveperson services via internet download typically have no set up fee  because we do not provide the customer with training  and administrative costs are minimal 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees from internet downloads as services are provided 
as sales via internet download increase  our average revenue per client tends to decline because services sold in this manner have a lower unit cost 
overall  our average revenue per client and per seat has declined  while the total number of our clients has increased 
we expect this trend to continue as we generate an increasing portion of revenue via internet downloads 
we also have begun to enter into contractual arrangements that complement our direct sales force and online sales efforts 
these are primarily with web hosting and call center service companies  pursuant to which liveperson is paid a commission based on revenue generated by these service companies from our referrals 
to date  revenue from such commissions has not been material 
prior to november  when the liveperson services were introduced  we generated revenue from services primarily related to web based community programming and media design 
revenue from such services was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of january  we no longer generated any revenue from these services 
revenue generated from web based community programming and media design services was recognized upon completion of the project  provided that no significant obligations remained outstanding and collection of the resulting receivable was probable 
operating expenses our cost of revenue associated with programming activity consisted primarily of personnel expenses associated with outsourced programming and design 
we no longer incurred these costs as of december we began developing the liveperson services in the third quarter of we did not allocate development costs of the liveperson services separately 
accordingly  since november  our cost of revenue has principally been associated with the liveperson services and has consisted of compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to our clients  consisting of people at december  including employees of humanclick and people at december  including employees of humanclick  compensation costs relating to our network support staff  consisting of people including employees of humanclick at december  and people at december   allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  and the cost of supporting our infrastructure  including expenses related to leasing space and connectivity for our services  third party network monitoring and depreciation of certain hardware and software 
our product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel  consisting of people including employees of humanclick and people including employees of humanclick at december  and  respectively  allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software 
product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel  consisting of people including employees of humanclick and people at december  and  respectively  allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  advertising  sales commissions  marketing programs  public relations  promotional materials  travel expenses and trade show exhibit expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive  accounting and human resources personnel  consisting of people including employees of humanclick and people including employees of humanclick at december  and  respectively  allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses 
in  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately million from  at december   principally due to an increase in accounts receivable and deteriorating aging due to slower collections 
a significant portion of this increase was due to overdue accounts receivable balances from our internet related clients with limited operating histories  many of which began to face difficult market conditions in the past year  and  in particular  during the nine months ended september  during  we wrote off approximately million of previously reserved accounts  leaving an allowance of  at december  we base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified known doubtful accounts plus a general reserve for potential future doubtful accounts 
we adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected 
we did not increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the three months ended december  this is attributable to the fact that our accounts receivable collections improved in the fourth quarter  due primarily to the significantly larger percentage of our total outstanding accounts receivable now comprised of businesses with more established and proven operating histories  and to a lesser extent  to the fact that an increased number of our clients now pay us by credit card  which transfers the collection risk to the credit card provider 
non cash compensation expense in the years ended december   and  we recorded an aggregate of   and  respectively  of non cash compensation expense in connection with grants to consultants of options to acquire an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the total values ascribed to such options were determined using a black scholes pricing model 
during may  we issued an option to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to shopnow 
com inc now known as network commerce inc  a client  in connection with an agreement to provide the liveperson services to network commerce for two years 
we were to receive subscription revenue from network commerce over the two year period based on the number of seats the client was using 
as discussed below  the option was amended in february the original terms of the option provided that it would vest in or before may  if revenue generated by network commerce met certain targets 
we granted the option as an incentive for entering into a two year service agreement with us  at a point in time when the liveperson services were new and their viability was unknown 
the option had no minimum revenue guarantee  and was exercisable for a period of three years from the date of grant 
we accounted for this option in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf abstract no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
pursuant to eitf no 
 we valued the option at each balance sheet date using a black scholes pricing model using a volatility factor of  a per share exercise price and the then fair value of our common stock as of each balance sheet date 
the  value ascribed to the option reflected the market value at december   less amortization expense of  for the period from may through december  which was recorded as net deferred cost on our december  balance sheet 
the unamortized value ascribed to this option was adjusted at each balance sheet date to bring the total ascribed value of the option up to the then current unamortized fair value 
this cost was ratably amortized over the two year service agreement  as we believed that the achievement of the revenue targets was probable 
as a result  we amortized  of the deferred costs as of december   of which  was offset against the  of revenue recognized from the client in  and the remaining  of sales and marketing expense was reflected as a non cash compensation expense  all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of in february  we amended the option agreement 
under the amendment  the option became fully vested and immediately exercisable  and network commerce exercised the option in may network commerce agreed  however  that it could not sell the underlying common stock until the earlier of five years or  if certain revenue targets were met  may  the value ascribed to the option at the time the option agreement was amended  using a black scholes pricing model  was  which was ratably amortized over the remaining service period of approximately fifteen months because the vesting of the option did not affect our obligation under the service agreement 
in addition  the ratable amortization of the remaining deferred cost of  was recorded as a reduction of the revenue recognized from network commerce with any excess amortization recorded as sales and marketing expense  which was reflected as a non cash compensation expense in our statement of operations 
we amortized  of the deferred costs during the year ended december   of which  was offset against the  of revenue recognized from network commerce 
the remaining  of sales and marketing expense was included in non cash compensation expense in our statement of operations 
as of march   we determined that it was unlikely that network commerce would meet the remaining revenue requirements under the agreement 
accordingly  we amortized the remaining deferred cost of  during the three months ended march   of which  was offset against the  of revenue recognized from network commerce 
the remaining  of sales and marketing expense was included in non cash compensation expense in our statement of operations for the quarter ended march  during and  we granted or assumed stock options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of and  per share  respectively  certain of which were granted at less than the deemed fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million and million  respectively  in connection with these options 
the aggregate amount of unamortized deferred compensation related to the grant of options which was subsequently reversed against paid in capital in connection with the forfeiture of those options associated with employees who left liveperson during the year ended december   approximated million 
in  we also recorded  of deferred compensation relating to the intrinsic value of unvested options assumed by us in connection with the humanclick acquisition 
these amounts are presented as deferred compensation within our consolidated financial statements and are being amortized over the vesting period  typically three to four years  of the applicable options 
we amortized approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  net of forfeitures or cancellations of approximately million in connection with employees who left liveperson in excluding the net non cash compensation credit of approximately million related to our restructuring initiatives in the first quarter of  the net non cash compensation charge of  for the year ended december  includes  related to the may option granted to network commerce discussed above   of amortization expense   of charges related to acceleration of vesting of options in connection with the termination of the employment of certain employees and million of credits due to forfeiture in connection with the termination of the employment of certain employees 
the aggregate amount of unamortized deferred compensation reversed against additional paid in capital for the year ended december  was approximately million 
this amount represents the forfeiture of options associated with liveperson employees whose employment was terminated as part of our restructuring initiatives 
the net non cash compensation expense of million for the year ended december  includes  related to the may option granted to network commerce  million of amortization expense  and  of charges related to the acceleration of vesting of certain employee options in connection with the termination of the employment of those employees 
in january  we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock in the amount of  in exchange for consulting services provided by silicon alley venture partners  llc 
results of operations due to our acquisition of humanclick in october  our significant restructuring initiatives during  and our limited operating history  we believe that comparisons of our  and operating results with each other  or with those of prior periods  are not meaningful and that our historical operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the introduction of a new range of services  increased online marketing efforts of the liveperson services and increased market acceptance of our services 
revenue in and included the recognition of  and  respectively  of set up fees due to client attrition

amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization expense relates to goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisition of humanclick in october we recorded amortization expense of million in  an increase from expense of  in non cash compensation expense  net 
non cash compensation expenses consist primarily of amortization of deferred stock based compensation in and deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to employees 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options 
we recorded a non cash compensation expense of  in  a decrease from expense of million in this decrease is due primarily to the reversal of previously recognized amortization of deferred compensation due to the forfeitures of employee stock options associated with employees who voluntarily left liveperson in  in the amount of approximately million 
the net non cash compensation amounts for the year ended december  exclude the net non cash compensation credit of million related to our restructuring initiatives in the first quarter of other income

total revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  all of our revenue in was from the liveperson services  while of our revenue in was from the liveperson services

the growth of our sales force has allowed us to solicit more prospective clients and to respond more quickly and effectively to their inquiries 
we cannot assure that we will achieve similar growth  if any  in future periods

our sales and marketing headcount grew to people at december  from people at december  the increase in sales staff headcount is attributable to the expansion of our sales efforts 
the increase in our marketing headcount and related expenses is due to our increasing efforts to enhance our brand recognition  and to support customer acquisition efforts 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive  accounting  human resources and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount  which grew to people at december  including employees of humanclick from people at december   and  to a lesser extent  due to insurance  professional fees  occupancy costs and depreciation 
non cash compensation expense  net 
non cash compensation expenses consist primarily of amortization of deferred stock based compensation in and  as well as compensation expense incurred in connection with options and preferred stock issued to non employees in lieu of payment for services rendered in deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to employees 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options 
non cash compensation expense increased to million in  from million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization expense relates to goodwill and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisition of humanclick in october other income 
interest income was million and  in and  respectively  and consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents generated by the receipt of proceeds from our initial public offering in and preferred stock issuances in and interest expense was  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income  particularly since the second quarter of  is due primarily to interest earned on the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placements of our series c and series d redeemable convertible preferred stock 
see part ii 
item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters use of proceeds from initial public offering 
other income in consists primarily of amortization of deferred gain on the sale leaseback of certain computer equipment 
net loss 
our net loss increased to million in  from million in liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through cash generated by private placements of convertible preferred stock and the initial public offering of our common stock 
through december   we have raised a total of million in aggregate net proceeds 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from december  we regularly invest excess funds in short term money market funds  commercial paper  government securities  and short term notes 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended december  and consisted of net operating losses  non cash items related to our restructuring initiatives  and a decrease in accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses due to our restructuring initiatives  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net operating losses and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in non cash compensation  depreciation and amortization expenses and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to million of restricted cash released pursuant to the cancellation of the lease of our former principal executive offices  which lease was terminated in september net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  and was due to the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized software  the purchase of short term available for sale investments and restricted cash requirements associated with the lease of our former principal executive offices 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from our initial public offering  the sale of our series d convertible preferred stock and exercise of our warrants and stock options 
we lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating leases 
these leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance 
rental expense for operating leases for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
in october  pursuant to our decision to relocate our principal executive offices  we entered into a lease for office space at a location in new york city 
the three year lease term commenced in november  with rent of approximately  in the first year   in the second year and  in the final year 
as of december   our principal commitments were approximately  under various operating leases  of which  is due in we do not currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ended december  will exceed  in the aggregate 
our capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed  in we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and services  to hire employees in our customer service  sales  marketing and administration departments  and for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as non cash compensation costs 
in addition  our annual revenue growth in was less than in  and our quarterly revenue declined in the second and third quarters of and did not increase materially in the first and fourth quarters of as a result  we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have been funded primarily through the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and  prior to the initial public offering  the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
in the first quarter of  following a review of our business in connection with our acquisition of humanclick  we commenced restructuring initiatives to streamline our operations  including the consolidation of our two san francisco bay area offices 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people as of the end of the first quarter of in the third quarter of  in a continued effort to streamline our operations  we initiated additional restructuring initiatives 
these initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions  the consolidation of all clients onto a single application platform and the move of our principal executive offices  which included the termination of an office space lease 
these initiatives resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people  the write off of impaired computer equipment and software and the write off of certain furniture  equipment and building improvements 
as a result of the various restructuring initiatives  for the year ended december   we recorded charges of approximately million for expenses related to the restructuring and impairment  all of which are expected to be paid by the end of in addition  for the year ended december   we also recognized a net non cash compensation credit in the amount of approximately million associated with liveperson employees who were terminated as part of our restructuring initiatives in first quarter of the net non cash compensation credit of million for the year ended december  represents the reversal of million of previously recognized amortization of deferred compensation related to employee stock options which did not vest due to the termination of their employment in connection with our restructuring initiatives  offset by the acceleration of vesting of certain other employee options of million also in connection with the restructuring initiatives 
approximately  of the million represents additional compensation related to the intrinsic value of options at the date of modification during we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time  and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings  or seek alternative sources of financing 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  when needed  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing  we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhanced services or products or to invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
recently issued accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued and  as amended by sfas no 
 was adopted by us in the fourth quarter of sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the adoption of this statement has not impacted our financial statements as we do not use derivative instruments 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for web site development costs  which provided guidance on when to capitalize versus expense costs incurred to develop a web site 
the consensus is effective for web site development costs in quarters beginning after june  we initially adopted the guidance as described by issue in  which has not materially impacted our results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and subsequently  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  after its adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
effective january  goodwill and intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption  and  if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we expect to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas nos 
and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
risk factors that may affect future results risks related to our possible delisting from nasdaq we face possible nasdaq delisting which would result in a limited public market for our common stock and make obtaining future equity financing more difficult for us 
we must satisfy a number of requirements to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market  including maintaining a minimum bid price for our common stock of per share and maintaining a market value for our publicly held shares of at least million 
a company fails to satisfy these requirements if its closing bid price remains below per share or if the market value for the publicly held shares remains below million  in each case  for consecutive business days 
on july   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market  inc  containing a nasdaq staff determination that we failed to comply with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a  and that our common stock was  therefore  subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
in addition  we received a letter from nasdaq  dated september   notifying us of our failure to maintain a minimum market value of public float of million over the preceding consecutive trading days as required by the nasdaq national market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
in october  our board of directors determined that it would not effect the one for fifteen reverse split of our common stock approved by our stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders held on september   due to the fact that on september   nasdaq informed us that on such date they had implemented a moratorium on the minimum bid price and market value of public float requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq stock market  which requirements were suspended until january  based on the foregoing  the hearing we had requested before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to appeal the july nasdaq staff determination that our common stock failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement was rendered moot 
on february   we received a letter from nasdaq  notifying us that during the preceding consecutive trading days  the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum bid price of per share as required by the nasdaq national market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
the letter stated that we have until may  to demonstrate compliance with such rule and that  if we are not in compliance by that date  nasdaq will notify us that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if such event occurs  we may appeal the decision to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
the letter also stated that we could apply to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
if a delisting from the nasdaq national market were to occur  shares of our common stock would likely trade on the nasdaq smallcap market  or  if we failed to meet the requirements of that market  in the over the counter market in the so called pink sheets maintained by pink sheets llc or on the national association of securities dealers otc bulletin board  which was established for securities that do not meet the listing requirements of the nasdaq markets 
such alternative trading markets  and  in particular  the pink sheets and the otc bulletin board  are generally considered less efficient than the nasdaq national market 
consequently  selling our common stock would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold  transactions could be delayed  and securities analysts and news media coverage of us may be reduced 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of common stock 
such delisting from the nasdaq national market or further declines in our stock price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing  and significantly increase the ownership dilution to stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions 
the price at which we issue shares in such transactions is generally based on the market price of our common stock and a decline in our stock price could result in the need for us to issue a greater number of shares to raise a given amount of funding or acquire a given dollar value of goods or services 
in addition  if our common stock is not listed on the nasdaq national market  we may become subject to rule g under the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
that rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers that sell low priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors 
for transactions covered by this rule  a broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may affect the ability of broker dealers to sell the common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market 
moreover  investors may be less interested in purchasing low priced securities because the brokerage commissions  as a percentage of the total transaction value  tend to be higher for such securities  and some investment funds will not invest in low priced securities other than those which focus on small capitalization companies or low priced securities 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and expect to encounter difficulties faced by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we have only a limited operating history providing the liveperson services upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects 
we began offering our services in november and we acquired humanclick in october  accordingly  the revenue and income potential of our business and the related market are unproven 
as a result of our limited operating history as an application service provider of real time sales and customer service technology for companies doing business on the internet  we have only three years of historical financial data relating to the liveperson services upon which to forecast revenue and results of operations 
in addition  because this market is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
before investing in us  you should evaluate the risks  expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies such as ours that are in the early stages of development and that are entering new and rapidly changing markets 
these risks include our ability to attract more clients and retain existing clients  sell additional seats for liveperson chat  which generate monthly fees  and other services to our existing clients  increase or maintain current pricing levels for our services  effectively market and maintain our brand name  respond effectively to competitive pressures  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  and attract  integrate  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing some or all of these risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and we may incur losses in the future 
we have not achieved profitability  and we may  in the future  incur losses and experience negative cash flow  either or both of which may be significant 
we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we had total revenue of approximately million for the year ended december   and less than million and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net loss for the year ended december  included a non cash dividend of million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we cannot predict our future capital needs to execute our business strategy and we may not be able to secure additional financing 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business  or to pay for acquisitions  we may need to sell additional equity  issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions 
in the past  we have obtained financing principally through the sale of preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and could have terms that impose restrictions on our operations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if required  will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund any potential expansion  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance our services or products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
those limitations would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have an unproven business model and may not generate sufficient revenue for our business to survive 
our business model is based on the delivery of real time sales and customer service technology and related services to companies doing business on the internet  a largely untested business 
sales and customer service historically have been provided primarily in person or by telephone 
our business model assumes that companies doing business on the internet will choose to provide sales and customer service via the internet 
our business model also assumes that many companies will recognize the benefits of an outsourced application  that internet users will choose to engage a customer service representative in a live text based interaction  that this interaction will maximize sales opportunities and enhance the online shopping experience and that companies will seek to have their online sales and customer service technology provided by us 
if any of these assumptions is incorrect  our business may be harmed 
in addition  we recently began offering the liveperson services via internet download  which is an unproven model for the delivery of our services 
we expect that a substantial majority of our revenue will come from the liveperson chat service for the foreseeable future and if we are not successful in selling this service  our revenue will not increase and may decline 
the success of our business currently substantially depends  and for the foreseeable future will continue to substantially depend  on the sale of only one service  liveperson chat 
we cannot be certain that there will be client demand for our services or that we will be successful in penetrating the market for real time sales and customer service technology 
our revenue declined in each of the second and third quarters of  and did not increase materially in the first or fourth quarters of  we cannot assure you that we will experience any revenue growth in the future 
a decline in the price of  or fluctuation in the demand by existing or potential clients for  our services  is likely to cause our revenue to decline 
the success of our business requires that clients continue to use the liveperson services and purchase additional seats 
our liveperson services agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
if a significant number of our clients  or any one client with a significant number of seats  were to terminate these services agreements  reduce the number of seats purchased or fail to purchase additional seats  our results of operations may be negatively and materially affected 
our client retention rates have recently declined as a result of a number of factors  including competition  consolidation in the internet industry and termination of operations by certain of our clients 
dissatisfaction with the nature or quality of our services  including our new software application platform introduced in the third quarter of  could also lead clients to terminate our service 
we depend on monthly fees from the liveperson services for substantially all our revenue 
if our retention rate declines further  our revenue could decline unless we are able to obtain additional clients or alternate revenue sources 
further  because of the historically small number of seats sold in initial orders  we depend on sales to new clients and sales of additional seats to our existing clients 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  including the following factors which are in part within our control  and in part outside of our control market acceptance by companies doing business on the internet of real time sales and customer service technology  our clients business success  our clients demand for seats and our other services  our ability to attract and retain clients  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  including those related to acquisitions  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  and changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors 
our revenue and results may also fluctuate significantly in the future due to the following factors that are entirely outside of our control seasonal factors affecting our clients businesses  economic conditions specific to the internet  electronic commerce and online media  and general economic and political conditions 
many of our clients businesses are seasonal 
our clients demand for real time sales and customer service technology in general and their demand for seats and our other services  in particular  may be seasonal as well 
as a result  our future revenue and profits may vary from quarter to quarter 
we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are meaningful 
you should not rely upon these comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our clients may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
some of our clients may experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans 
these clients may reduce their spending on our services  or may not be able to discharge their payment and other obligations to us 
these circumstances are influenced by general economic and industry specific conditions  and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as a result of these conditions  our clients  in particular our internet related clients that may experience or that anticipate experiencing difficulty raising capital  may elect to scale back the resources they devote to customer service technology  including services such as ours 
if the current environment for our clients  including  in particular  our internet related clients  does not improve  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the non payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of clients would negatively impact our financial condition 
in the year ended december   we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately million from  at december  a significant portion of this increase was due to overdue accounts receivable balances for our internet related clients with limited operating histories  many of which began to face difficult business conditions in the past year  and  in particular  during the nine months ended september  during  we wrote off approximately million of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance of  at december  we did not increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the three months ended december  this is attributable to the fact that our accounts receivable collections improved in the fourth quarter  due primarily to the significantly larger percentage of our total outstanding accounts receivable now comprised of businesses with more established and proven operating histories  and to a lesser extent  to the fact that an increased number of our clients now pay us by credit card  which transfers the collection risk to the credit card provider 
we may not be able to effectively manage our changing operations 
since the launch of our services in november  we have grown rapidly  even in light of our recent restructuring initiatives 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational  technical and financial resources 
in  we replaced our existing accounting and other back office systems at a cost of approximately million 
in  in connection with our restructuring initiatives  we implemented a less expensive accounting system 
the cost of this new system was immaterial 
the new systems are being integrated with our operations  controls and procedures 
if we are not able to successfully integrate these new systems with our existing systems  or if we incur significant additional costs in order to achieve such integration  our business could be harmed 
in order to manage our growth  we must also continue to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow  our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
staff attrition could strain our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
we had employees at december   employees at december   and employees at december  in the area of technology  we had employees at december   employees at december   and employees at december  any staff attrition we experience  whether initiated by the departing employees or by us  could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to the extent that we do not initiate or seek any staff attrition that occurs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire adequate replacement staff promptly  if at all  and even that if such staff is replaced  we will be successful in integrating these employees 
in both the first and third quarters of  in addition to conducting regularly occurring performance related terminations  we commenced restructuring plans pursuant to which we eliminated a large number of positions in response to changes in our business needs  such as redundancies in our research and development and client support functions and the transition of a portion of our sales efforts from direct sales to more automated internet based sales processes 
we expect to evaluate our needs and the performance of our staff on a periodic basis  and may choose to make further adjustments in the future 
if the size of our staff is significantly further reduced  either by our choice or otherwise  we could face significant management  operational  financial and other constraints 
for example  it may become more difficult for us to manage existing  or establish new  relationships with clients and other counterparties  or to expand and improve our service offerings 
it may also become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace 
further  it may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems  including our financial and managerial controls  billing systems  reporting systems and procedures 
thus  any significant amount of staff attrition could cause our business and financial results to suffer 
our business is dependent on a few key employees  including our chief executive officer  robert p 
locascio 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management team  including robert p 
locascio  our founder and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team  in particular mr 
locascio  could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  since november  many members of our senior management team left liveperson 
although we do not believe that changes in our senior management team have materially harmed our business  they have distracted us from other important tasks  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate newly hired senior managers who will work together successfully with our existing management team 
if we do not successfully integrate potential future acquisitions  our business could be harmed 
in the future  we may acquire or invest in complementary companies  products or technologies 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to us  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  products and personnel with liveperson  diversion of financial and management resources from efforts related to the liveperson services or other then existing operations  risks of entering new markets beyond providing real time sales and customer service technology for companies doing business on the internet  potential loss of either our existing key employees or key employees of any companies we acquire  and our inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we could face additional regulatory requirements  tax liabilities and other risks as we expand internationally 
in october  we acquired humanclick  an israeli based provider of real time online customer service applications with more than  customers around the world and employees at the date of acquisition 
in addition  during a portion of and  we conducted operations in the united kingdom 
there are risks related to doing business in international markets  such as changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  more stringent rules relating to the privacy of internet users and adverse tax consequences 
in addition  there are likely to be different consumer preferences and requirements in specific international markets 
furthermore  we may face difficulties in staffing and managing any foreign operations 
one or more of these factors could harm any future international operations 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  or if we are unable to outsource certain functions  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled senior managers and other employees with appropriate qualifications 
also  our workforce reductions announced in the first and third quarters of may adversely affect the morale of  and our ability to retain  those employees who were not terminated 
because our stock price has suffered a significant decline  the stock options held by our employees and other equity based compensation may have diminished effectiveness as employee retention devices 
if our retention efforts are ineffective  employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide services to our clients would be materially and adversely affected 
our reputation depends  in part  on factors which are entirely outside of our control 
our services appear as a liveperson branded or a custom created icon on our clients web sites 
the customer service operators who respond to the inquiries of our clients internet users are employees or agents of our clients  they are not our employees 
as a result  we have no way of controlling the actions of these operators 
in addition  an internet user may not know that the operator is an employee or agent of our client  rather than a liveperson employee 
if an internet user were to have a negative experience in a liveperson powered or humanclick powered real time dialogue  it is possible that this experience could be attributed to us  which could diminish our brand and harm our business 
finally  we believe the success of our services depend on the prominent placement of the icon on the client s web site  over which we also have no control 
we may be unable to continue to build awareness of the liveperson brand name 
building recognition of our brand is critical to establishing the advantage of being among the first application service providers to provide real time sales and customer service and to attracting new clients 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or incur significant expenses in promoting our brand without an associated increase in our revenue  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent on technology systems that are beyond our control 
the success of the liveperson services depends in part on our clients online services as well as the internet connections of visitors to their web sites  both of which are outside of our control 
as a result  it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur 
in the past  we have experienced problems related to connectivity which have resulted in slower than normal response times to internet user chat requests and messages and interruptions in service 
the liveperson services rely both on the internet and on our connectivity vendors for data transmission 
therefore  even when connectivity problems are not caused by the liveperson services  our clients or internet users may attribute the problem to us 
this could diminish our brand and harm our business  divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant client relations problems 
in addition  we rely on a third party web hosting service provider for internet connectivity and network infrastructure hosting  security and maintenance 
the provider has  in the past  experienced problems that have resulted in slower than normal response times and interruptions in service 
if we are unable to continue utilizing the services of our existing web hosting provider or if our web hosting services experience interruptions or delays  it is possible that our business could be harmed 
our service also depends on many third parties for hardware and software  which products could contain defects 
problems arising from our use of such hardware or software could require us to incur significant costs or divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts 
to the extent any such problems require us to replace such hardware or software  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 
technological defects could disrupt our services  which could harm our business and reputation 
we face risks related to the technological capabilities of the liveperson services 
we expect the number of simultaneous chats between our clients operators and internet users over our system to increase significantly as we expand our client base 
our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
additionally  we must continually upgrade our software to improve the features and functionality of the liveperson services in order to be competitive in our market 
if future versions of our software contain undetected errors  our business could be harmed 
as a result of major software upgrades at liveperson  our client sites have  from time to time  experienced slower than normal response times and interruptions in service 
if we experience system failures or degraded response times  our reputation and brand could be harmed 
we may also experience technical problems in the process of installing and initiating the liveperson services on new web hosting services 
these problems  if unremedied  could harm our business 
the liveperson services also depend on complex software which may contain defects  particularly when we introduce new versions onto our servers 
we may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
it is possible that  despite testing by us  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could result in damage to our reputation  lost sales  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing client preferences in the online sales and customer service industry and this may harm our business 
if we are unable  for technological  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales and customer service industry or our clients or internet users requirements  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
business on the internet is characterized by rapid technological change 
in addition  the market for online sales and customer service technology is relatively new 
sudden changes in client and internet user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  such as broadband communications  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render the liveperson services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
the rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance the features and performance of the liveperson services  develop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business on the internet and internet users  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost effective and timely manner 
if any of our new services  including upgrades to our current services  do not meet our clients or internet users expectations  our business may be harmed 
updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are not competitive in the market for real time sales and customer service technology  our business could be harmed 
there are no substantial barriers to entry in the real time sales and customer service technology market  other than the ability to design and build scalable software and  with respect to outsourced solution providers  the ability to design and build scalable network architecture 
established or new entities may enter this market in the near future  including those that provide real time interaction online  with or without the user s request 
we compete directly with companies focused on technology that facilitates real time sales and customer service interaction 
our competitors include customer service enterprise software providers such as egain communications corp  divine  inc  kana software  inc  and rightnow technologies  inc  some of which offer hosted solutions 
furthermore  many of our competitors offer a broader range of customer relationship management products and services than we currently offer 
we may be disadvantaged and our business may be harmed if companies doing business on the internet choose sales and customer service technology from such providers 
we also face potential competition from larger enterprise software companies such as oracle and siebel systems 
in addition  established technology companies  including ibm and microsoft  may also leverage their existing relationships and capabilities to offer real time sales and customer service applications 
finally  we face competition from clients and potential clients that choose to provide a real time sales and customer service solution in house as well as  to a lesser extent  traditional offline customer service solutions  such as telephone call centers 
we believe that competition will increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger client bases  greater brand recognition  more diversified lines of products and services  and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources 
these competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services 
any delay in the general market acceptance of the real time sales and customer service solution business model would likely harm our competitive position 
delays would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings  and would also provide time for new competitors to develop real time sales and customer service applications and solicit prospective clients within our target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
our business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon the protection of our intellectual property rights relating to the technology underlying the liveperson services 
we currently have a us patent application pending relating to such technology and have not filed applications outside the us the us patent and trademark office has issued a non final office action rejecting our patent application 
we have not yet responded to the office action  however  it is possible that our pending patent application may not result in the issuance of a patent  any patent issued may not be broad enough to protect our intellectual property rights  any patent issued could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the invention claimed in the patent  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our service or design around any patent we may have  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
further  to the extent that the invention described in our us patent application was made public prior to the filing of the application  we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain foreign countries 
we also rely upon copyright  trade secret and trademark law  written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology  processes and other intellectual property  to the extent that protection is sought or secured at all 
we currently have one common law trademark  liveperson  one registered us trademark  liveperson give your site a pulse and one pending us trademark application  humanclick 
with regard to the humanclick mark  the us patent and trademark office published such mark for opposition on january   and may issue a notice of allowance with respect to such mark if no opposition was filed by february  however  the us patent and trademark office has not yet indicated whether timely opposition was filed  no final determination as to the registrability of this mark has been made  and  ultimately we may not be able to secure registration of this trademark 
we do not have any trademarks registered outside the us  nor do we have any trademark applications pending outside the us we cannot assure you that any steps we might take will be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties 
similarly  we cannot assure you that third parties will not be able to independently develop similar or superior technology  processes or other intellectual property 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
if this occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time consuming to litigate  may distract management from operating our business and may result in our loss of significant rights 
our products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management 
although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether our services and technology infringe patents held by others  and we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights 
if we infringe upon the rights of third parties  we may not be able to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms 
in that event  we would need to undertake substantial reengineering to continue offering our services 
any effort to undertake such reengineering might not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
if any of these events occurred  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we may be liable if third parties misappropriate personal information belonging to our clients internet users 
we maintain dialogue transcripts of the text based chats between our clients and internet users and store on our servers information supplied voluntarily by these internet users in exit surveys which follow the chats 
we provide this information to our clients to allow them to perform internet user analyses and monitor the effectiveness of our services 
some of the information we collect in text based chats and exit surveys may include personal information  such as contact and demographic information 
if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal information relating to our clients internet users or the text of customer service inquiries  we could be subject to liability 
we could be subject to negligence claims or claims for misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
the need to physically secure and securely transmit confidential information online has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and online communications 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using online services such as the ones we offer  or from using them to conduct transactions which involve transmitting confidential information 
because our success depends on the general acceptance of our services and electronic commerce  we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
risks related to our acquisition of humanclick and its business political  economic and military conditions in israel could negatively impact our israeli operations 
our product development staff  help desk and online sales personnel are located in israel 
although substantially all of our sales to date have been made to customers outside israel  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
further  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in the relationship between israel and the palestinian authority and serious violence has ensued  the peace process between the parties has stagnated  and israel s relationship with several arab countries has been adversely affected 
moreover  hostilities during the early part of have escalated significantly  with increased attacks in israel and an armed conflict between israel and the palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
efforts to resolve the conflict have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict could adversely affect our operations in israel and our business 
further deterioration of the situation into a full scale armed conflict might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our israeli employees and might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in israel and our business 
in addition  several arab countries still restrict business with israeli companies 
our operations in israel could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel and israeli businesses 
if we do not successfully integrate humanclick or the merger s benefits do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts  the market price for our common stock may decline 
on october   we acquired humanclick with the expectation that this merger will result in significant benefits 
we have no experience in managing a customer base as large as humanclick s and very little direct experience in offering real time  online customer service applications to small and mid sized businesses 
furthermore  humanclick s principal offices are located in israel while our principal offices are located in new york  managing the business in a coordinated fashion may therefore require additional management resources 
we will need to overcome these significant issues  among others  in order to realize any benefits or synergies from the mergers 
our successful execution of these post merger events will involve considerable risk and may not be successful 
the market price of our common stock may decline  and we may lose key personnel and customers as a result of this merger if we do not successfully integrate operations and personnel of humanclick or if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 
if the costs associated with the humanclick acquisition exceed the benefits realized  we may experience increased losses 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate sufficient revenue from the sale of humanclick s services  which have only recently begun to generate revenue  to offset expenses associated with the acquisition 
accordingly  if the benefits of this acquisition do not exceed the costs associated with it  including dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of up to approximately million shares of our common stock in the acquisition  our financial results could be adversely affected 
risks related to our industry we are dependent on continued growth in the use of the internet as a medium for commerce 
we cannot be sure that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium for commerce 
our long term viability depends substantially upon the widespread acceptance and development of the internet as an effective medium for consumer commerce 
use of the internet to effect retail transactions is at an early stage of development 
convincing our clients to offer real time sales and customer service technology may be difficult 
demand for recently introduced services and products over the internet is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
few proven services and products exist 
the development of the internet into a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors  including continued growth in the number of users  concerns about transaction security  continued development of the necessary technological infrastructure  development of enabling technologies  uncertain and increasing government regulation  and the development of complementary services and products 
we depend on the continued viability of the infrastructure of the internet 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience growth in the number of users and frequency of use by consumers resulting in increased bandwidth demands  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure for the internet will be able to support the demands placed upon it 
the internet has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure 
outages or delays could adversely affect online sites  email and the level of traffic on the internet 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide our clients and internet users with access to the liveperson services 
in the past  users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our service 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity 
insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and negatively impact use of the internet generally  and our clients sites including the liveperson or humanclick pop up dialogue windows in particular 
if the use of the internet fails to grow or grows more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support growth that may occur or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  we may not achieve profitability and our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation and legal uncertainties 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent 
recently  the united states congress enacted internet legislation relating to issues such as children s privacy  copyright and taxation 
the children s privacy legislation imposes restrictions on the collection  use and distribution of personal identification information obtained online from children under the age of the copyright legislation establishes rules governing the liability of internet service providers and web site publishers for the copyright infringement of internet users 
the tax legislation places a moratorium on certain forms of internet taxes for three years  however  this moratorium does not apply to sales and use taxes 
additionally  the european union has adopted a directive addressing data privacy which imposes restrictions on the collection  use and processing of personal data 
existing legislation and any new legislation could hinder the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a medium for communication  commerce and advertising 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where legislation has been enacted 
it may take several years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  taxation and personal privacy apply to the internet and internet services 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the us and abroad  which may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we do not comply with recent legislation or laws or regulations relating to the internet that are adopted or modified in the future 
for example  the liveperson services allow our clients to capture and save information about internet users  possibly without their knowledge 
additionally  our service uses a tool  commonly referred to as a cookie  to uniquely identify each of our clients internet users 
to the extent that additional legislation regarding internet user privacy is enacted  such as legislation governing the collection and use of information regarding internet users through the use of cookies  the effectiveness of the liveperson services could be impaired by restricting us from collecting information which may be valuable to our clients 
the foregoing could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
security concerns could hinder commerce on the internet 
user concerns about the security of confidential information online has been a significant barrier to commerce on the internet and online communications 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet or other online services or from using them to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information 
if internet commerce is inhibited as a result of such security concerns  our business would be harmed 
other risks our executive officers  directors and or greater stockholders will be able to influence matters requiring a stockholder vote 
our executive officers  directors and stockholders who each own greater than of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
the future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market  or if our stockholders are perceived by the market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
affiliates of liveperson may not sell their shares of our common stock except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act covering the resale of those shares  or an exemption under the securities act  including rule persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of liveperson include those persons or entities who directly or indirectly control liveperson  such as our directors  executive officers and significant stockholders 
our stock price has been highly volatile and may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations in the future which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation 
fluctuations in market price and volume are particularly common among securities of internet and other technology companies 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to be highly volatile  with extreme price and volume fluctuations  in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in market valuations of publicly traded companies in general and internet and other technology companies in particular  our announcements of significant client contracts  acquisitions and our ability to integrate these acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  our failure to complete significant sales  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and terrorist attacks against the united states or in israel  the engagement in hostilities or an escalation of hostilities by or against the united states or israel  or the declaration of war or national emergency by the united states or israel 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation  which could result in substantial costs and distract management from other important aspects of operating our business 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  such as our staggered board of directors  the manner in which director vacancies may be filled and provisions regarding the calling of stockholder meetings  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  provisions of our amended and restated bylaws  such as advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals  and applicable provisions of delaware law  such as the application of business combination limitations  could impose similar difficulties 
further  provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to directors  stockholder meetings  limitation of director liability  indemnification and amendment of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws may not be amended without the affirmative vote of not less than of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors considered for this purpose as a single class cast at a meeting of our stockholders called for that purpose 
our amended and restated bylaws may not be amended without the affirmative vote of at least of our board of directors or without the affirmative vote of not less than of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors considered for this purpose as a single class cast at a meeting of our stockholders called for that purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations through december   our results of operations  financial position and cash flows have not been materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the non us dollar 
the functional currency for our former operations in the united kingdom is the uk pound sterling and the functional currency of our wholly owned israeli subsidiary  humanclick ltd  is the us dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
collection risk our accounts receivable are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
in the year ended december   we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately million from  at december   principally due to an increase in accounts receivable and deteriorating aging due to slower collections 
a significant portion of this increase was due to overdue accounts receivable balances for our internet related clients with limited operating histories  many of which began to face difficult business conditions in the past year  and  in particular  during the nine months ended september  during  we wrote off approximately million of previously reserved accounts  leaving an allowance of  at december  we did not increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the three months ended december  this is attributable to the fact that our accounts receivable collections improved in the fourth quarter  due primarily to the significantly larger percentage of our total outstanding accounts receivable now comprised of businesses with more established and proven operating histories  and to a lesser extent  to the fact that an increased number of our clients now pay us by credit card  which transfers the collection risk to the credit card provider 
interest rate risk our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect in any material respect the value of the investments as recorded by us
