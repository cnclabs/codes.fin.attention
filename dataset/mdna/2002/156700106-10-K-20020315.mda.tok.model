critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
certain of the company s telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue 
under such sharing arrangements  which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies  participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market 
these revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs 
typically  participating companies have months to update or correct data previously submitted 
as a result  revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the company s estimates 
historically  revisions of previous revenue estimates as a percentage of consolidated revenues have not been material 
accounting for the effects of regulation 
the company s regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of sfas property  plant and equipment of the company s regulated telephone operations has been depreciated using the straight line method over lives approved by regulators  such lives have generally exceeded the depreciable lives used by nonregulated entities 
in addition  in accordance with sfas  retirements of regulated telephone property have been charged to accumulated depreciation  along with the costs of removal  less salvage  with no gain or loss recognized 
these policies have resulted in accumulated depreciation being significantly less than if the company s telephone operations had not been regulated 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuance of application of fasb statement no 
sfas  specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of sfas sfas requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by non regulated enterprises  along with an adjustment of certain accumulated depreciation accounts to reflect the difference between recorded depreciation and the amount of depreciation that would have been recorded had the company s telephone operations not been subject to rate regulation 
sfas further provides that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for non regulated enterprises 
deferred tax liabilities and deferred investment tax credits will be impacted based on the change in the temporary differences for property  plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation 
the company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of sfas to its regulated telephone operations by  among other things  assessing the extent of its interstate and intrastate operations that are subject to various forms of alternative regulation instead of traditional rate of return regulation 
it is possible that changes in regulation  legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the company s telephone operations no longer being subject to sfas in the near future 
when the regulated operations of the company no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the net adjustments required may result in a material  noncash charge against earnings which would be reported as an extraordinary item 
for regulatory purposes  the accounting and reporting of the company s telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of sfas the properties to be acquired from verizon in are not expected to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas long lived assets 
through december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas the carrying value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and allocated goodwill  was reviewed for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that such carrying value was not recoverable  by assessing the recoverability of such carrying value through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or the acquired business 
effective january   the company will be required to test for impairment under two new accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
under sfas  impairment of goodwill will be tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit will be based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company is in the process of determining the impact  if any  of the transitional goodwill impairment rules of sfas under sfas  the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value 
for additional information on the company s critical accounting policies  see accounting pronouncements and regulation and competition other matters  and the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet 
the company had no derivative instruments outstanding at january  and thus no transition adjustment was recorded upon adoption of sfas as of december   the company had outstanding an interest rate swap relating to million of floating rate debt designed to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the payment of interest related to such debt 
under sfas  the company does not expect fluctuations in the fair value of the swap to be recorded in its statements of income 
in addition  the company has from time to time entered into interest rate hedge contracts in anticipation of certain debt issuances to manage interest rate exposure 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas sfas requires all business combinations consummated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires goodwill recorded in a business combination to be reviewed for impairment and would be written down only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
effective january   systematic amortization of goodwill is no longer required 
the company s amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
the application of the transitional goodwill impairment rules of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  which replaces sfas  and supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions related to discontinued operations under accounting principles board opinion no 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the company s ability to recover certain costs applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
while the rate making process does not permit the company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant  the company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time 
possible future regulatory changes may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations 
for additional information regarding the current regulatory environment  see regulation and competition

the company s financing plans are not yet complete and will be dependent upon the company s review of its alternatives and market conditions 
the properties to be acquired are currently subject to price cap regulation for interstate purposes  and the company has no plans to change this 
because most of the company s other telephone properties are subject to rate of return regulation  the company s plans to retain price cap regulation for the acquired properties will require it to seek a waiver of the fcc s all or nothing regulation that generally requires a rate of return company acquiring a price cap company to convert all of its operations to price cap regulation 
although the fcc has granted similar waivers to other carriers over the past couple of years  no assurances can be provided that the fcc will grant a waiver to the company 
the company s failure to obtain this waiver would adversely impact the financial benefits that the company anticipates receiving in connection with its purchases of the verizon properties

these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry 
in  the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
the act provides certain exemptions for rural lecs such as those operated by the company 
under the fcc s august order implementing most of the act s interconnection provisions  rural lecs have the burden of proving the availability of these exemptions 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities are also expected to increasingly compete with lecs 
as mandated by the act  in may the fcc modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies 
the fcc adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period  effective july   based on embedded  or historical  costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers  including substantially all of the company s local exchange carriers 
the company estimates based on current operations  the current nationwide average cost per loop and other factors that such ruling will increase the company s level of universal service support receipts by approximately million on an annualized basis compared to previous levels 
during the company s revenues from the federal universal service fund totaled approximately million which includes million from the verizon properties acquired in 
during  such revenues totaled million which includes million from the verizon properties 
on october   the fcc modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return local exchange carriers  which includes all of the company s local exchange carriers 
this order  among other things  i increases the caps on the subscriber line charges slc to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide  ii allows limited slc deaveraging  which is expected to enhance the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility  iii lowers per minute rates collected for federal access charges  which might increase competition with centurytel s long distance operations to the extent other carriers seek to take advantage of this change  iv creates a new explicit universal service support mechanism that will replace other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas and v terminates the fcc s proceeding on the represcription of the authorized rate of return for rate of return lecs  which will remain at 
the company expects the order to be implemented on a revenue neutral basis for interstate purposes  although there can be no assurance to this effect 
other proposals submitted to the fcc by the multi association group representing rural carriers were rejected or deferred for additional comment 
recent events affecting the company 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
the number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas has increased in recent years  especially in the newly acquired verizon markets  and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
state alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the company s lecs have also affected revenue growth recently 
although the company believes that these plans may be favorable in the future as additional revenue streams are added and cost efficiencies are obtained  there can be no assurance that current or future alternative regulation plans will not reduce future revenue growth 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
there is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced intrastate access revenues in the future 
in addition  the company continues to receive pressure from other cellular operators to reduce roaming rates in the company s cellular markets 
in response  the company anticipates that it will continue to enter into agreements that will reduce its roaming rates from current levels 
the company further anticipates that the adverse impact of reduced roaming rates may be partially offset by increased roaming traffic 
in august  the company was awarded an interim access rate increase by the wpsc for the former verizon properties in wisconsin in an amount of approximately million annually 
such rates are subject to refund pending an order establishing permanent rates 
on october   the wpsc approved a permanent rate increase of million annually for the local exchange properties that the company acquired from ameritech in december the wpsc ordered the company to refund a portion million of the previously approved interim rates 
such refund had the effect of a one time reduction in revenue of approximately  as the company was not recognizing of the interim rates as revenue 
separately  the wpsc ordered the company to refund million related to access charges collected from interexchange carriers on the former ameritech properties from december through such ruling was upheld upon appeal in wisconsin state court 
the company is currently appealing this ruling to the state of wisconsin court of appeals 
if this appeal is unsuccessful  the company will have to record a one time charge of 
per share 
in august  the arkansas public utility commission apuc approved tariff amendments that limit the number of minutes included for a flat rate in certain optional calling plans in certain of the acquired verizon markets 
once fully implemented in january  the company anticipates that these tariff revisions will reduce the level of its operating expenses by approximately million annually 
on march   the arkansas court of appeals vacated two orders issued by the apuc in connection with the company s acquisition of its arkansas lecs from verizon in july  and remanded the case back to the apuc for further hearings 
the court took these actions in response to challenges to the rates the company has charged other lecs for intrastate switched access service 
the company intends to move for a rehearing of the court s decision  and is currently evaluating the legal and financial implications of the court s decision 
competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s telephone operations are located 
although the company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term  the company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions 
while the company expects its telephone revenues to continue to grow  its internal telephone revenue growth rate has started to slow in recent years and may continue to slow during upcoming periods 
the company s wireless operations are subject to increased competition from large wireless carriers offering nationwide calling plans 
the company does not offer a nationwide calling plan at this time and may be hindered in its ability to compete for customers seeking these plans 
additionally  several wireless carriers have taken initial steps to abandon the tdma standard used by the company and to provide enhanced next generation wireless services utilizing different technologies 
if the company elects to continue to use the tdma standard or to forego implementation of enhanced wireless services  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to receive support from vendors or to compete effectively against competitors using different technologies or offering more services 
for these and other reasons  in august  the company announced that it is exploring the potential separation of its wireless business from its other operations 
other matters 
the company s regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of sfas  under which the company is required to account for the economic effects of the rate making process  including the recognition of depreciation of plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators 
the ongoing applicability of sfas to the company s regulated telephone operations is being monitored due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments 
when the regulated operations of the company no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the net adjustments required may result in a material  extraordinary  noncash charge against earnings 
the properties to be acquired from verizon in are not expected to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material
