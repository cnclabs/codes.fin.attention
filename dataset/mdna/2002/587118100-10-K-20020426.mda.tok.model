item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the men s wearhouse opened its first store in houston  texas in august the company combined with moores retail group inc moores in february and with k g men s center  inc k g in june  with both combinations accounted for as a pooling of interests see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at february   we operated stores in the united states and stores in canada 
we opened stores in  stores in and stores in  in addition  we acquired one store in expansion is generally continued within a market as long as management believes it will provide profitable incremental sales volume 
historically  this growth has resulted in significant increases in net sales and has also contributed to increased net earnings 
however  in  we experienced decreases in net sales and net earnings as a result of the declining us economy and the effects of the events of september  see results of operations discussion herein 
like most retailers  our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  more than of our net sales and more than of our net earnings have been generated during the fourth quarter of each year 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year 
we intend to continue our expansion in new and existing markets 
we plan to open approximately new men s wearhouse stores and five new k g stores in and to expand and relocate approximately existing men s wearhouse stores and up to five existing k g stores 
the average cost excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory of opening a new store is expected to be approximately million for a men s wearhouse store and approximately million for a k g store in we have closed stores in the three years ended february  generally  in determining whether to close a store  we consider the store s historical and projected performance and the continued desirability of the store s location 
in determining store contribution  the company considers net sales  cost of sales and other direct store costs  but excludes buying costs  corporate overhead  depreciation and amortization  financing costs and advertising 
store performance is continually monitored and  occasionally  as neighborhoods and shopping areas change  management may determine that it is in our best interest to close or relocate a store 
in  four of the stores closed were stores acquired in january that were closed as part of our efforts to integrate and develop our operations that target the more price sensitive clothing customer 
of the remaining stores closed in  two were closed due to substandard performance or lease expiration and were closed to eliminate duplicate store sites following the combinations with moores and k g 
in  three stores were closed due to substandard performance 
in  three stores were closed due to substandard performance or lease termination 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  since future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and continuously evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
we believe our critical accounting policies and our most significant estimates are those that relate to inventories and our estimated liabilities for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and employee health benefit costs 
our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining 
our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  procurement and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to average inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
we self insure portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors 
we also use actuarial estimates with respect to workers compensation 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments

sales of men s tailored apparel are particularly affected since buying patterns for men are considered to be more discretionary than those in other apparel areas 
the negative effect of the terrorist events of september  on retail and numerous other business sectors also contributed to the decline 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin predominately resulted from an increase in occupancy cost which is relatively constant on a per store basis as a percentage of sales and a larger percentage of the sales mix being contributed by our lower margin k g brand

the credit agreement also provides for fees applicable to unused commitments 
as of february  and february   there was no indebtedness outstanding under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive and financial covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum level of net worth and certain financial ratios 
the credit agreement also prohibits payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
we are in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement 
in addition  we have two canadian credit facilities a revolving credit agreement which provides for borrowings up to can million us million through february  and a term credit agreement under which we borrowed can million us million in february the term borrowing is payable in quarterly installments of can million us million beginning may  with the remaining unpaid principal payable on february  the effective interest rate for the term borrowing was and at february  and february   respectively 
covenants and interest rates are substantially similar to those contained in our credit agreement 
as of february  and february   there was us million and us million outstanding under these credit agreements  respectively 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement 
we had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  our working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup is financed with both short term and long term borrowings in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
our operating activities provided net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts resulted mainly from net earnings plus depreciation and amortization and increases in liabilities  offset by increases in inventories and other assets and  in  a decrease in income taxes payable 
the increase in inventories of million in  million in and million in resulted from the addition of inventory for new and acquired stores and stores expected to be opened shortly after the year end  backstocking and the purchase of fabric used in the direct sourcing of inventory 
other assets increased primarily due to increased investment in tuxedo rental merchandise  while income taxes payable decreased in mainly due to reduced earnings 
our investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively  due mainly to capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the following table details our capital expenditures in millions new store construction relocation and remodeling of existing stores information technology distribution facilities other total property additions relating to new stores include stores in various stages of completion at the end of the fiscal year one store at the end of  two stores at the end of and three stores at the end of 
our expenditures for the relocation and remodeling of existing stores have increased as we have opened fewer new stores 
in addition  in the company purchased the minority interests in certain k g stores for million 
we also had million cash provided from investing activities in from net maturities of short term investments 
in march  we entered into agreements for the license  implementation and maintenance of several software applications developed and owned by a third party 
the applications subject to the agreements relate to transaction processing associated with purchasing  distributing and retail sales of merchandise  as well as tools necessary to plan those activities and evaluate actual performance 
we expect the phased implementation of these software applications to take place over the next months and ultimately lead to a common system across all of our brands 
during  we expect to incur approximately million for software and related implementation costs and similar amounts in each of the subsequent two years 
the timetable with respect to this implementation is within our discretion 
we used net cash in financing activities of million in  million in and million in mainly for net payments of long term debt and purchases of treasury stock 
in january  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares in the open market or in private transactions  dependent on the market price and other considerations 
on january   the board of directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program for up to an additional two million shares of our common stock 
during and  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock under this program at a cost of million and million  respectively 
during  in connection with the share repurchase program  we issued three separate option contracts under which the contract counterparties had the option to require us to purchase  shares of our common stock at specific strike prices per share 
we received premiums of million for issuing these contracts  all of which expired unexercised 
our primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases as well as to fund capital expenditure requirements which are anticipated to be approximately million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new men s wearhouse stores and five new k g stores in at an expected average cost per store of approximately million for the men s wearhouse stores and approximately million for the k g stores excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory 
the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment and systems and store relocations  remodeling and expansion 
the company anticipates that each of the approximately new men s wearhouse stores and each of the approximately five new k g stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately million and million  respectively subject to the same seasonal patterns affecting inventory at all stores  which will be funded by our revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry and recent financial difficulties of significant menswear retailers may present us with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our various credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
in connection with our direct sourcing program  we may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the euro 
we generally enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
as the majority of the forward exchange contracts are with five financial institutions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated 
we may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions 
other matters in january  we formed a joint venture company chelsea for the purpose of developing a new point of sale software system for the company and after successful implementation  exploring the possibility of marketing the system to third parties 
under the terms of the agreement forming chelsea  we owned of chelsea and a director and officer owned with the understanding that the officer would assign  either directly or indirectly  some of his interest in chelsea to other persons involved in the project 
the point of sale system was developed and successfully deployed by the company during and from january though march  we funded and recognized as expense all of the operating costs of chelsea  which aggregated million 
on march   chelsea sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry 
in connection with the sale  a former employee of chelsea filed suit attempting to enjoin the sale and alleging that he owned or was otherwise entitled to part of the officer s interest in chelsea and alleging that the company conspired with the officer to deprive him of such interest 
this suit was settled in connection with the sale by paying the claimant a portion of the sale proceeds  concurrently  in connection with the settlement  the officer assigned his remaining interest in chelsea to us and received none of the proceeds 
as a result of the sale by chelsea  and after giving effect to the settlement of the lawsuit  the company received a net amount of million 
approximately million of this amount will be recognized as a pretax gain by the company pending the resolution over the next months of certain indemnification provisions related to the assets sold 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two new pronouncements statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations completed after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas at the beginning of fiscal  which will eliminate approximately million of amortization expense related to the million unamortized cost of such assets as of february  amortization expense recognized in fiscal and for these assets was million and million  respectively 
based on the results of our preliminary evaluation of the impairment testing provisions of sfas  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in the foreseeable future 
in june and august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  and statement no 
 impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas provides a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of these statements is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rates 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
at february   we had contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency  maturing at various dates through january at february   we had contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency 
unrealized pretax losses on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at february  and approximately million at february  a hypothetical change in applicable february  forward rates would increase or decrease this pretax loss by approximately million related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
we are also subject to market risk due to our long term floating rate term loan of million at february  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase our interest expense and payments by approximately million
