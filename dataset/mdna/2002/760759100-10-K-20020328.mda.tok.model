item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
financial objectives in january  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following increasing free cash flow by to million  or over of net income 
growing revenue by  with from price and from volume 
increasing earnings per share by to 
this objective assumed a v shaped recovery in the economy during the second half of the year 
using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to million of our stock 
maintaining our strong balance sheet evidenced by a debt to total capitalization ratio in the mid to low range 
business performance revenue and operating margins were pressured by falling commodity prices during the first quarter 
our internal growth for the quarter  excluding the impact of commodity prices  was with coming from price and from volume 
higher fuel costs also pressured margins during the quarter 
in addition  we strengthened our regional management structure by adding sales  maintenance and operational personnel during this period 
this increase in staff resulted in increased selling  general and administrative costs placing further downward pressure on operating margins 
during the second quarter of  revenue and operating margins were negatively impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices 
in addition  we began to see a slowdown in the manufacturing sector  particularly in the midwestern and mid atlantic states 
our internal growth for the quarter  excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations  was with coming from price and coming from volume 
higher labor costs also pressured margins during the quarter 
during the second quarter  we acquired richmond sanitary services  located in northern california 
richmond complemented our business platform by providing us with a vertically integrated business in a growth market 
during the third quarter of  the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry 
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken 
in addition  the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united states  particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the carolinas 
these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers 
our internal growth for the quarter  excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations  was with coming from price and 
coming from volume 
this rate of internal growth was approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters of while we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers  these customers generally produce less revenue and lower margins than other types of customers 
also during the third quarter  operating margins continued to be pressured by lower commodity prices and higher labor costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were also higher due to the previously discussed strengthening of our regional management structure and due to an increase in bad debt expense attributable to the economic slowdown 
during the third quarter  we sold million of unsecured notes with a coupon rate of that mature in this transaction allowed us to secure long term financing at  what we believe  is a very favorable rate 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector 
we also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services 
furthermore  we began to see a softening in residential construction activity 
as a result  internal growth for the quarter  excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations  was with coming from price and 
coming from volume 
internal growth for all of  excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations  was with coming from price and coming from volume 
operating margins also weakened during the fourth quarter for the reasons mentioned above 
we continued to see medical costs escalate and we began to experience higher costs for risk insurance 
we also continued to experience higher labor costs and selling  general and administrative costs due to the strengthening of our regional management structure 
in addition  bad debt expense continued to increase as a result of the economic slowdown 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
included in this charge are the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses  asset impairments  downsizing our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments  an increase in insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown 
on a reported basis  including the impact of the charge  our earnings per share for were 
on an adjusted basis  before considering the impact of the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter  our earnings per share were 
while we did not achieve our announced earnings per share objective for for reasons primarily attributable to the economic slowdown  our free cash flow was million or of adjusted net income 
our disciplined approach to managing capital expenditures and our focus on monetizing accounts receivable helped us to exceed our free cash flow objective 
our debt to total capitalization as of december  was 
during  we used our free cash flow to repurchase million shares of our common stock for million 
in addition  we acquired richmond sanitary services  a fully integrated waste disposal company located in northern california 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter specific guidance is as follows our goal is to generate million in free cash flow 
this includes the net impact of the change in accounting for goodwill 
the comparable amount in  assuming the change in accounting for goodwill was effective january   would have been million 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october we anticipate earnings per share of to 
this includes the expected decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the change in accounting for goodwill 
we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be to  approximately attributable to price and 
to attributable to volume 
business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained in our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows improve our revenue 
the first step in this process was completed in and included installing a standardized billing and operating system 
this system enables us to  among other things  stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing 
during  we expect to implement the second generation of this software which we call rsi rsi will be our company s core business system providing a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis and route productivity analysis 
we are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 
during  we also implemented a customer relationship management system 
this system will improve the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for existing and potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
our focus during will be to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended 
improve the productivity of our operations 
we have instituted a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we routinely use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we completed a disposal optimization review 
this review determines which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
in february  we selected dossier as our fleet management and procurement system 
among other features  this system will track parts inventories  generate automatic quantity order points and log all maintenance work 
it will allow us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system will allow us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
we expect to have dossier implemented at all of our hauling operations by the end of  and we expect to roll this system out to our landfill operations in enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we currently have several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
the most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package 
by february  we successfully converted of our locations to lawson general ledger software 
we expect to have the entire company converted to lawson by the third quarter of all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  during all of our software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan  if necessary 
expand our safety training programs 
as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance costs  we are expanding our safety training programs in we have signed a multi year agreement with dupont safety resources to assist us in successfully completing this initiative 
our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations  and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services  including recycling and compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions collection residential commercial industrial other total collection    transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other total revenue    certain amounts for and in the table above have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in any of the last three years 
during  our largest customer comprised less than of our consolidated revenue and our largest municipal franchise comprised less than 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december   approximately of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  accruals for closure and post closure costs  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized or accrued and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire  construct  close and maintain a site during the post closure period 
cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs and accrue closure and post closure costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace  inflation rates and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas deemed likely to be permitted 
critical accounting policies and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
in  we significantly expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that require subjective or complex judgments including landfill accounting  fixed assets and the activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and post closure accruals  insurance reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of our continuing commitment to reliable and transparent financial reporting that allows the users of our financial statements to make more informed decisions  we have prepared the following list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain

we use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability 
we measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
business combinations we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
we have included businesses that we acquired and which have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended december   which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was million 
the aggregate purchase price paid  less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed  was million 
in july  we entered into a definitive agreement with allied waste industries to acquire certain solid waste assets 
in  we had completed the purchase of these assets for approximately million in cash  million of which were acquired during in october  we entered into a definitive agreement with allied for the simultaneous purchase and sale of certain other solid waste assets 
in  we and allied had completed the purchase and sale of these assets for which annual revenue was approximately million 
our net proceeds from the cash portion of the exchange of assets were million 
all of these transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in september  we signed an agreement with waste management to acquire assets and to enter into disposal agreements at various waste management facilities 
by june  we had completed the purchase of the assets for approximately million in cash plus properties  million of which were acquired during the six months ended june  the assets purchased included landfills  transfer stations and commercial collection routes across the united states  and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in addition to the acquisitions from allied and waste management  we also acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended december  and  which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price we paid in these transactions was million and million in cash  respectively 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
we amortize cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over forty years on a straight line basis 
as of december   the amortization expense associated with these intangible assets on an annualized basis is approximately million 
we believe the forty year life assigned to the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is reasonable as the businesses we acquired are generally well established companies which have been in existence for many years and have stable  long term customer relationships 
during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
as of december   we had million of landfill development costs which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs 
if multiple entities are included in an acquisition  purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily closure and post closure liabilities 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes likely to be permitted airspace where appropriate 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
in addition  during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
in addition  during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace 
see note  business combinations  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of business combinations 
background in may  autonation announced its intention to separate our company  which at the time was a wholly owned subsidiary of autonation  from autonation  and for our company to complete an initial public offering of common stock 
as a result  we entered into certain agreements with autonation providing for the separation and governing various interim and ongoing relationships between our company and autonation 
in addition  our outstanding shares of common stock held by autonation were recapitalized into million shares 
in july  we completed an initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately billion 
in addition  in july we repaid in full amounts due to autonation as of june  through the issuance of million shares of our common stock and through the payment of all proceeds from our initial public offering 
in may  we completed a secondary offering in which autonation sold substantially all of our common stock it owned 
we received no proceeds in the secondary offering 
autonation provided our company with the services of a number of its executives and employees 
in consideration for these services  autonation allocated to our company a portion of its general and administrative costs related to these services 
in january  we entered into a services agreement with autonation under which autonation agreed to continue to provide various general and administrative services to our company in exchange for a monthly fee of million 
the services agreement expired on june  our management believes that the amounts allocated to our company and or charged under the services agreement were no less favorable to our company than costs we would have incurred to obtain such services on our own or from unaffiliated third parties 
we recorded other charges of million for the year ended december  these costs relate to our separation from autonation 
they consist of million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
see note  stock options  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
they also consist of million of other additional charges directly related to our separation 
the historical consolidated financial information included in this annual report on form k does not necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we been operated as a separate  stand alone entity during this period 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and our net income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and million in our operating results for the years ended december   and include other charges described below 
the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for through revenue    cost of operations    depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets selling  general and administrative expenses other charges

revenue was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue increased by million  or  from to revenue increased by million  or  from to the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december   and price 
volume total internal growth acquisitions total revenue growth price growth for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by declining commodity prices 
excluding the negative effect of commodity prices  price growth was for the year ended december  in addition  non core operations increased volume growth during the year ended december  excluding the positive impact of non core operations  volume growth was for the year ended december  as such  adjusted internal growth for the year ended december  was 
during the first and second quarters of  our revenue was negatively impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector  particularly in the midwestern and mid atlantic states 
during the third quarter of  the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry 
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken 
in addition  the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united states  particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the carolinas 
these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers  which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector 
we also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services 
furthermore  we began to see a softening in residential construction activity 
our price and volume growth rates may decline in depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars from to is a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenue remained constant from to because improved operating efficiencies and an increase in higher margin landfill operations primarily due to acquisitions were offset by higher fuel and labor costs 
the increase in aggregate dollars from to is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in insurance reserves 
excluding the impact of this charge  cost of operations for was  million or as a percent of revenue 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily a result of the economic slowdown  lower commodity prices  higher labor costs and higher costs for risk and health insurance partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and revenue mix 
in addition  during we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers  however  these customers generally produce less revenue and lower margins than other customers 
we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high or increase further depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment 
depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars for all periods presented and the increase as a percentage of revenue from to are primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to lower depletion expense at our landfills resulting from higher compaction and more cost efficient cell construction 
amortization of intangible assets 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  but also includes values assigned to long term contracts and covenants not to compete 
commencing january   cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired is no longer required to be amortized 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to applying our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are fees paid to autonation under the services agreement of million for the year ended december  see note  related party transactions  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting from the economic slowdown 
excluding the impact of this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses for are million or as a percent of revenue 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional management structure and various systems and training initiatives 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses in the range of of revenue is appropriate for given our business platform 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments 
other charges were million for the year ended december  these charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south texas 
we recorded other charges of million for the year ended december  these charges relate to our separation from autonation 
they include million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant

interest expense 
we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility  unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense from to is primarily due to an increase in average debt balances 
the increase is also due to a general market increase in interest rates starting in the third quarter of the decrease in interest expense from to is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our revolving credit facility and unsecured notes 
the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into in september capitalized interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net of other expense  was million  million and 
million for the years ended december   and  respectively

this charge primarily relates to an increase in bad debt reserves associated with the economic slowdown 
we also recorded million to other charges 
this amount relates primarily to the completed or planned divestitures of certain core and non core operations and asset impairments pursuant to a plan adopted by us during the fourth quarter of this plan includes divesting several collection and transfer station operations resulting in a loss of approximately million 
these operations generated approximately of our consolidated revenue during the sale of a portion of these operations during generated cash proceeds of approximately million 
the sale of the remaining operations is expected to generate cash proceeds of approximately million 
our plans also include closing three of our smaller landfills 
these landfills generated less than 
of our consolidated revenue during in addition  we recorded an asset impairment for a fourth landfill 
in total  we recorded a loss of approximately million associated with the early closure of landfills or impairment charges 
the remaining amount recorded to other charges during the fourth quarter is primarily for the planned disposition of excess assets 
approximately million of the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter relates to ongoing future lease commitments and other obligations associated with planned divestitures 
landfill and environmental matters among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills 
the additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations

 number of sites expansion airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites total available airspace cubic yards in millions  
 number of sites during  we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was consumed 
as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of airspace deemed by us to be likely to be permitted 
these estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of expansion airspace which has been determined by us as likely to be permitted 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined as likely to be permitted and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet our expansion criteria 
see note  landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   of our landfills meet the criteria for including expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including the expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
as of december   nine of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process 
also  as of december   five of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities 
the remaining six landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level 
we have never been denied an expansion permit for a landfill that included likely to be permitted airspace in its total available disposal capacity  although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted as designed 
closure and post closure costs the following table reflects our closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed for the years ended december   and closure and post closure expense in millions cubic yards of airspace consumed in millions closure and post closure expense per cubic yard 


as of december   accrued closure and post closure costs were million 
the current portion of these costs of million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities 
the long term portion of these costs of million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 
as of december   assuming that all available landfill capacity is used  we expect to expense approximately million of additional closure and post closure costs over the remaining lives of our facilities 
our estimates for closure and post closure do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs 
if total estimated costs were discounted to present value  they would be lower

landfill amortization and depletion expense in millions airspace consumed in millions of cubic yards amortization and depletion per cubic yard of airspace consumed as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional million on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected gross investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or 
per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method 
our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs 
for further information  see closure and post closure costs 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate 
no material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended december   and financial condition one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple  cost effective and transparent capital structure 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we also had million of restricted cash  of which million relates to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing that will be used to fund capital expenditures 
at december   we had million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing outstanding at favorable interest rates 
in july  we entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
million of the credit facility expires in july and the remaining million expires in july borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor based rates 
we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and other requirements 
as of december   we had million of availability under our credit facility 
as a result of our strong financial position and liquidity  in february we reduced the short term and long term portion of our credit facility by million and million  respectively 
in may  we sold million of unsecured notes in the public market 
million of these notes bear interest at per annum and mature in the remaining million bear interest at per annum and mature in interest on these notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
the million and million in notes were offered at a discount of million and 
million  respectively 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into a million operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility 
in august  we sold million of unsecured notes in the public market 
the notes bear interest at per annum and mature in interest on these notes is payable semi annually in february and august 
the notes were offered at a discount of million 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions 
the swap agreements have a total notional value of million and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 
the swap agreements terminate in may at december   we had million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately million was obtained during fiscal borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from to at december  and have maturities ranging from to as of december   we had million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings 
this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
we plan to extend to july the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in july we believe that such an extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 
we believe that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing  if necessary  to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms 
selected balance sheet accounts in  we were the first in our industry to provide the users of our financial statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance sheet accounts 
these additional disclosures include schedules that show the activity in our available airspace  investment in landfills  property and equipment  and other selected balance sheet accounts 
we believe that these disclosures permit the readers of our financial statements to gain a better understanding of our company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued closure and post closure  accrued self insurance and amounts due to former owners during the years ended december   and in millions allowance for closure and amounts due to doubtful accounts post closure self insurance former owners balance  december  additions charged to expense additions due to acquisitions  net of divestitures usage balance  december  current portion long term portion allowance for closure and amounts due to doubtful accounts post closure self insurance former owners balance  december  additions charged to expense additions due to acquisitions  net of divestitures usage balance  december  current portion long term portion allowance for closure and amounts due to doubtful accounts post closure self insurance former owners balance  december  additions charged to expense additions due to acquisitions  net of divestitures usage balance  december  current portion long term portion our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for and was 
and  respectively 
this increase is due to the economic slowdown that we experienced during our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for and was and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to an overall increase in insurance costs that we experienced during additions to accrued liabilities related to acquisitions are periodically reviewed during the year subsequent to the acquisition 
during such reviews  accrued liabilities which are considered to be in excess of amounts required for a specific acquisition are reversed and charged against goodwill cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate

the tables above exclude million of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles which were added during the year ended december  and are subject to our operating lease facility 
liquidity and capital resources the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december   and are discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business and timing of receipts and payments from accounts receivable and accounts payable  respectively 
we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and debt repayments 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for business acquisitions and capital additions 
cash used to acquire businesses  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital additions were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  our revolving credit facility  tax exempt bonds and other financings 
we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities during the years ended december   and included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three years  proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in and  and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds in and in may  we sold unsecured notes with a face value of million at a discounted price of million 
in august  we sold unsecured notes with a face value of million at a discounted price of million 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into a million operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
during fiscal  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
during fiscal  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock 
as of december   we paid million to repurchase approximately million shares of our stock 
we intend to finance future stock repurchases through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  our revolving credit facility and other financings 
we used proceeds from our revolving credit facility  unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt 
credit rating our company has received investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   our senior debt was rated baa by moody s  bbb by standard poor s and bbb by fitch 
one of our key financial objectives is to maintain our investment grade credit rating on our senior debt 
we believe that frequent communication with our rating agencies and providing them with detailed information concerning our financial and operational performance is critical in achieving this objective 
the following table summarizes certain financial ratios as of and for the years ended december   and that we believe are important to our credit rating agencies adjusted a net debt to total capitalization net debt to ebitda b x x x x ebitda to interest expense b x x x x operating income to total assets a adjusted results for exclude an million after tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses  asset impairments  downsizing our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments  an increase in insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown 
b ebitda represents operating income plus depreciation  amortization and depletion 
while ebitda data should not be construed as a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our operating performance  financial position and cash flows  we have included ebitda data  which is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  because we believe that this data is commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a company s financial performance 
due to the fact that not all companies calculate non gaap measures in the same manner  the ebitda presentation herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our company 
operating lease facility one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple  cost effective and transparent capital structure 
as we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the securities and exchange commission  in december  we entered into a million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
the facility has a term of three years with two consecutive one year renewals and was entered into primarily because its implicit interest rate was over ten basis points less than our revolving credit facility at the time 
the facility meets the criteria of an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly we have not recorded this facility as debt nor have we recorded the related operating equipment as assets on our balance sheets 
however  we have included the cost of operating equipment acquired under the facility as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash flow 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility 
if this facility were treated as debt as of december   our debt to total capitalization would increase from to 
as a result of our success in obtaining financing in the public markets  including tax exempt bonds  we do not anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future 
fuel hedge our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of diesel fuel 
because the market for derivatives in diesel fuel is limited  we have entered into heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in diesel prices 
we have minimized our credit risk by entering into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having investment grade ratings 
our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  certain criteria must be met including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
under these option agreements  we receive or make payments based on the difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed prices 
these option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a predetermined fixed price in the option agreements  but also limit our ability to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the option agreements 
during june  we entered into option agreements for approximately million gallons of heating oil 
these option agreements settle each month in equal notional amounts through december the option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil 
the fair value of these option agreements at december  was determined by third parties to be a loss of approximately million million net of tax 
in accordance with sfas  million  representing the effective portion of the change in fair value during the period has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value was a loss of approximately 
million for the year ended december  and has been included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
realized losses of 
million for the year ended december  related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
future obligations the following table summarizes our significant future obligations as of december  minimum lease payments operating other maturities of notes lease operating payable and closure and year ending december  facility leases long term debt post closure total thereafter   total   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and through interest rate swaps 
all items described below are non trading 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total december  variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates interest rate swaps amount outstanding in millions 
average interest rates the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
seasonality our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  the use of the poolings of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  is prohibited 
this statement also changes the criteria for the recognition of acquired intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting completed after june  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the provisions of sfas  most of our intangible assets will no longer be subject to amortization 
however  we will be required to change our methodology for evaluating impairments to intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas and have not yet determined the effects of these changes on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june   and will require our company to change the accounting methodology we currently use to record closure and post closure liabilities related to our landfills 
the more significant of these changes includes measuring all future obligations at fair value and discounting obligations to reflect today s dollars 
this statement requires a cumulative effect approach to recognizing transition amounts for existing retirement obligations 
we are currently evaluating the effect of adoption of this statement  and have not determined whether the impact of adoption will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves certain sfas implementation issues 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and is generally to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
