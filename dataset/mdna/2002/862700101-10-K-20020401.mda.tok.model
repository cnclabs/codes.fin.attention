overview the company develops  manufactures and markets immunoassay based test kits for rapid and cost effective detection of a wide variety of substances in the food safety and water quality markets 
through its strategic biosolutions division  the company also provides antibody and immunoreagent research  development and production services 
since its inception  the company and its predecessors have  in addition to conducting internal research and development of new products  entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the food safety  water quality and other markets 
the company expects that internal research and development projects  primarily in the food safety area  will continue to represent a larger percentage of its research and development expenditures 
the company believes that its competitiveness has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the relationships and the acquisitions it concluded during the past five years 
these relationships and acquisitions have enabled the company to achieve meaningful economies of scale for the unique products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits  antibodies and biochemicals  its facility located in oceanside  california for the manufacture of instruments  its facility located outside of san diego  california currently being relocated to windham  maine  see note for the manufacture of antibodies and biochemicals and its facility located in windham  maine for the manufacture of custom  high volume bulk polyclonal antibodies 
these economies of scale  in turn  enable the company to offer its customers the most appropriate test for each specific customer application 
on september  the company acquired azur environmental azur  a privately held manufacturer of proprietary rapid test systems  including the microtox toxicity test system  which measures toxicity in drinking and process water  formerly located in carlsbad  california 
with more than peer reviewed scientific articles and more than  instruments sold worldwide  the microtox toxicity test system has been approved in regulations or standards in canada  eight european countries  and has been submitted to the us epa for approval 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued  shares of series c preferred stock  with a fair market value of approximately million  as determined by an independent valuation firm 
on november  the  series c preferred shares were automatically converted to  shares of the company s common stock in accordance with their terms see note 
with the acquisitions of hti bioproducts  inc and certain assets of atlantic antibodies  the company formed a new operating division  strategic biosolutions  which has now become one of the largest producers of antibodies in the united states 
the mission of strategic biosolutions is to supply monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as research institutions 
the company believes that its products in the food safety and water quality testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
revenues in any particular quarter may not be indicative of revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year  or for the year 
with the anticipated increase in sales of the company s microtox test systems these tests are generally not affected by seasonal patterns and as sales of food safety products to other parts of the world develop over the next few years  the company expects its seasonal fluctuations to become gradually less pronounced 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by business segment and market category 
in thousands year ended increase percent decrease change kit segment water quality    food safety    contract and other revenues  total kit revenues    antibody segment revenues   total net revenues    water quality revenue growth is primarily attributable to strong demand since september th for the company s recently acquired general screening test for chemical toxicity  microtox r 
this product was acquired during in connection with the acquisition of azur environmental 
in the period from september th through december   the company sold approximately microtox r units primarily to the drinking water industry as a means to detect the presence of toxic concentrations of chemicals in water supplies 
revenues from the sale of these units and their attendant consumables were approximately million during the september th through december  period 
the company expects water quality revenues to grow in  particularly due to increased demand for microtox r and its attendant consumables as water processors and users have a heightened awareness of the potential threat of chemical contamination intentional or otherwise 
food safety revenue growth is primarily due to increased sales of tests to detect genetically modified organisms gmos in plants  seeds  grain and intermediate food products including tests to detect starlink tm in corn 
the company continues to lead the market with tests for every significant trait in commercial production 
the company expects sales in the food safety category to continue to grow for the year  primarily in the third and fourth quarters  as gmo testing for traits other than starlink tm expand throughout the food complex and as several new products  including additional gmo tests  the animal feed tests and the food borne pathogen lateral flow strip tests are developed and brought to market 
contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
these revenues are expected to be in the range of the revenues for the foreseeable future 
antibody revenue declined slightly in as the company began consolidating its operations into a single site at its maine location during the company has recently opened the first of two new production facilities on the maine site and expects the second facility to open in march once both facilities are fully operational and validated  which is expected in june  the company will be able to offer expanded production capacity with key customer features such as the ability to produce a wide variety of antibody programs 
with these capabilities  the company expects to be well suited to meet the needs of its marketplace  particularly the in vitro diagnostic market and anticipates that revenue will grow  particularly in the second half of the year 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or in this increase included additional costs of the consolidation of the california and maine facilities of thousand  test kit inventory adjustments of approximately thousand and thousand of costs for a retainer and fees 
the consolidation expenses include relocation  moving  startup and severance expenses incurred in connection with the winding down of antibody production facilities in california and the startup of combined operations at its windham  maine facilities 
of these expenses  approximately thousand were related to manufacturing expenses associated with the closing and startup of the antibody facilities and the balance were selling  general and administrative expenses primarily associated with the relocation to windham  maine 
the inventory adjustments resulted from a computational and procedural error that resulted in higher inventory values 
these items were identified as the company completed its accounting for the fiscal year 
to correct this error  inventory was reduced by thousand and manufacturing expenses were increased by thousand 
the retainer and related fees relates to an engagement of an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives 
this engagement commenced in july and is for a one year term 
operating expenses before the items described above increased million or to million as described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the cost of goods sold  increased million or to million 
after the effect of the thousand adjustment for the maine consolidation and the thousand inventory adjustment described above  manufacturing expenses increased million or from the year earlier period 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales in and the increased costs attendant to the consolidation of the antibody facilities  which required the company to run certain duplicative operations to facilitate the transition 
as previously stated  the company expects to consolidate its antibody operations during  which should produce savings of between thousand and million per year 
gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs increased thousand or to million and gross margins declined to in from in after giving effect to the adjustments in described above  gross profits increased thousand or and gross margins declined to in from in the decline in gross margins is attributable to the increased costs of production during the transition of the antibody manufacturing facilities from california to maine as described above  and lower selling prices for certain products in the food safety category at substantially higher volumes in gross margins are expected to improve in particularly in the second half of the year  when several new products in the food safety category are expected to be introduced to the market and with the completion of the consolidation of the antibody operation in maine and the operating efficiencies expected to be derived in the second half of there from 
therefore  margins for the antibody segment in  particularly in the second half of  are expected to exceed those reported in research and development expenses were approximately the same in the year as in these expenses are expected to grow in as additional resources are devoted to developing new products  including a test for unapproved proteins in animal feed for mcdonald s corporation  the lateral flow food pathogen tests and additional tests for genetic traits 
the increase is expected to range from to  depending on the resource requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased thousand or to million 
after adjusting for thousand in costs related to the maine consolidation and thousand in costs for a retainer and fees related to the engagement of an investment bank as described above  selling  general and administrative expenses increased thousand or 
this increase is primarily attributable to the general increase in business activity 
these expenses are expected to continue to grow in with the expected further increase in business activity 
however  as a percent of revenues  these expenses are expected to decline from to a range under of revenues  as the company leverages its selling  general and administrative investments through greater efficiencies of selling additional products to its existing customer base 
interest expense net net interest expense decreased thousand or  due to the lower levels of debt carried throughout versus income taxes income tax expense decreased thousand  largely due to reduced pre tax earnings 
in  the company recorded a favorable adjustment to income tax of thousand compared to a thousand favorable adjustment recorded in these adjustments reflect the increased utilization of the company s net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
the company s effective annual tax rate rose slightly after the effect of these adjustments to of pre tax earnings in from the rate recorded in net income net income decreased thousand or in the year when compared to the year for the reasons described above  in particular the additional costs of the consolidation of the california and maine facilities of thousand  thousand in inventory adjustments and thousand in costs for a retainer and fees related to the engagement of an investment bank 
these additional costs were partially offset by a thousand favorable tax adjustment 
the net after tax effect of these items was thousand 
when taking into account these items  net income rose thousand or in to million from the million recorded in year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in versus this increase was the result of a million or increase in product related revenues offset by a thousand or decrease in contract and other revenues 
the growth in product revenues was primarily attributable to increases in sales of products in the food safety category  primarily in the fourth quarter tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants as sales in this category of products grew from the levels achieved in this increase was due primarily to sales of the company s products to detect the genetic traits in starlink tm corn 
sales of the company s traitcheck bt product exceeded million tests  virtually all of which were sold in the fourth quarter of revenues of antibody products grew from the levels  due primarily to the full year inclusion of revenues from the hti acquisition in february of  and the oem business of atlantic antibodies in may of these increases were partially offset by decreases in the company s water quality category and decreases in sales of other products when compared to the revenues recorded in these categories 
revenues in the other products category in included sales of macra lp a testing kits  a product line which the company sold in  but for which sales under a manufacturing agreement with the buyer of the product occurred during there were no comparable sales in the year the decline in contract and other revenues was primarily the result of the company s continued emphasis on internal research and development programs versus contractual sponsored research and development programs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or in to million from million in  exclusive of the million one time charge in for acquired research and development as a result of the hti acquisition 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the general business activity that occurred during the year and is described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the cost of products sold  increased million or in to million from million in this was primarily the result of the increase in product related revenues in and additional manufacturing expenses associated with the ramp in production to meet the strong demand for starlink tests 
throughout the fourth quarter  we were able to ship test kits without any significant customer backorders 
we met this demand by increasing production to three shifts at certain times  particularly early in the quarter as we built inventories 
by the end of the quarter  we were able to smooth out production and returned to a more normalized production schedule 
we experienced price pressure in the food safety category later in the fourth quarter as competitors launched products 
research and development expenses increased thousand or in to million from million in this increase was due to the company s continuing investment in new product development for its food safety category of products tests to detect genetic traits in genetically engineered plants and the ongoing project expenses related to the bayer ag sponsored drug level monitoring project 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased thousand or in to million from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased selling and marketing costs in the food safety and antibody product categories 
interest expense net net interest expense increased thousand or  due to the higher levels of debt carried throughout the year versus the year income taxes during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax charge of thousand net of a reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately thousand and in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax benefit of million  also related to a reduction in the valuation allowance  all in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas since management believed that it is more likely than not that the company will realize that portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets under sfas has no impact on the company s cash flows for income taxes 
as a result net income comparisons between and are not meaningful 
net income net income decreased thousand or  exclusive of the million income tax benefit and the million one time acquired research and development charge in  recorded in connection with the hti acquisition 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the income tax provision of thousand for the year ended december   offset by a gain on sale of assets of thousand from the sale of the company s macra lp a product line  also recorded in the year pre tax net income exclusive of the million one time acquired research and development charge increased by thousand or to million in from million in liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital  which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventory  increased million in to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in the company s cash and cash equivalents of million and to lesser increases in accounts receivable and inventory accounts when compared to the prior year 
outstanding debt decreased thousand from million at december  to million on december  on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank  which provides for a million term loan  of which approximately million was outstanding at december   repayable over three years  and up to a million revolving line of credit  of which no amount was outstanding at december  proceeds from this financing retired substantially all of the company s previous indebtedness 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with the same commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provides for up to million in construction financing  of which thousand is outstanding at december  and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments to begin when construction is completed  or august   whichever is earlier 
under the terms of the above financings  the company is required to meet certain financial covenants including funded debt to ebitda and ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and taxes 
at december   the company is in compliance with all such covenants  and accordingly  the related debt is classified as long term 
as of march   that company has determined that it will violate one of the covenants for the quarter ending march  further  the company has assessed it is also probable that it will violate certain financial covenants for other quarterly measurement dates during with the violation of the covenant on march   the commercial bank has the right to demand repayment of the debt 
the company is in the process of renegotiating the restrictive covenants with the commercial bank however  it has not reached a definitive agreement 
as of march   the outstanding balance on this debt was approximately million 
the financing is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the company is confident that it will be able to successfully negotiate a waiver of or modification to these covenants to cure any violations 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash available and on hand  and from the financing agreements described above 
at december   the company had million in long term debt and stockholders equity of over million 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts our long term indebtedness and leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  this schedule excludes an obligation in connection with the acquisition of hti bio products inc to pay a percentage of net sales of certain products over the three year period from february  to february   not to exceed million 
any payments under this agreement will be recorded as additional goodwill 
in thousands payments due by year and total beyond long term debt   operating leases  construction related total contractual cash obligations   see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our long term debt 
see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it has  or has access to sufficient resources to meet these contractual obligations and its operating requirements for the forseeable future 
the company currently has in place an agreement to borrow up to million on a revolving line of credit  of which no amount is outstanding at december  the company s ability to meet its capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the ability to meet the loan covenant requirements or obtain waivers necessary under its current debt agreements  the success of its current and future products  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation and the company s marketing and distribution strategy 
the company s future capital requirements could change as a result of a number of factors including the focus and direction of its research and development program and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
accounting standards potential impact of our critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable our accounts receivable as of december   and  was net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables become uncollectable  we charge these write offs against the allowance 
valuation of inventories our inventories  which consist primarily of test kit components  bulk serum and antibody products are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory 
revenue recognition product related sales are composed of the sale of immunoassay based test kits and the sale of certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents 
for  and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
the sale of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical and other reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided and when collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales of certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized under the percentage of completion method and are recorded based on the percentage of costs or time incurred through the reporting date versus the estimate for the complete contract or project 
for  and these sales represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
contract revenues are recognized upon the completion of contractual milestones 
for  and these sales represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
new accounting standards and disclosures in june  the fasb issued sfas no
