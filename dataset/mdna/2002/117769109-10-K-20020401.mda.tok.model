item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national food distributor  as the primary distributor of our food 
although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available  any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by sysco could cause our food costs to increase 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature southern italian cuisine served primarily in family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
we may be unable to sustain profitability we intend to expend significant financial and management resources on the development of additional restaurants 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain revenue growth  profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
failure to achieve these objectives may cause our stock price to decline and make it difficult to raise additional capital 
see item selected consolidated financial data for the history of our losses prior to fiscal we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
due to our limited financial resources and operating history  we may be unable to compete effectively with larger  better established competitors  which have substantially greater financial resources and operating histories than we do 
we will likely face direct competition with these competitors in each of the markets we enter 
see item business competition for a discussion of the competition we face 
we could face potential labor shortages our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff  necessary to keep pace with our expansion schedule 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and we may face liability under dram shop statutes our business depends on obtaining and maintaining required food service  health department and liquor licenses for each of our restaurants 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
in addition  our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations we must comply with 
complaints or litigation from guests may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially adversely affect us and our restaurants  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held liable 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we will need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  your holdings may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  we are unable to obtain sale leaseback financing of certain restaurants  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  we are able to secure a greater number of attractive development sites than currently anticipated  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes and other natural disasters 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and other earthquake prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance coverage for the effects of adverse publicity and any adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
terrorist attacks or acts of war could adversely affect our restaurant sales and operations the september  terrorist attacks on the united stated had a significant negative impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
with the threats of additional terrorist attacks and the continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  there is a potential for a continued downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors  should they continue  could adversely affect our restaurant sales  operations and profitability 
we could face consolidated tax group liability prior to our spin off in late fiscal  we were a member of the consolidated tax group of parasole restaurant holdings  inc under the internal revenue code  as a former member of the consolidated tax group  we could be held liable for unpaid federal tax liabilities  if any  of the consolidated tax group through the end of in the event of nonpayment by parasole

the calculation of comparable restaurant sales increases decreases includes restaurants open for full calendar months for fiscal years through in fiscal  we changed our method of calculating comparable restaurant sales to restaurants open for a full months 
the fiscal and years were adjusted to provide comparable week or week fiscal years 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general at december   we owned and operated full service  dinner only restaurants that offer high quality  immigrant southern italian cuisine served family style in large portions in a fun and energetic atmosphere that parodies the decor and ambiance of post war italian american restaurants 
since  we have pursued a rapid but disciplined expansion strategy  opening two restaurants in  five in  eight in  in  and in and in january  we purchased the assets of nine vinny testa s italian american restaurants 
we intend to open new buca di beppo restaurants in fiscal  of which seven have opened through march of the remaining seven locations  all have leases signed and five are under construction 
beginning in fiscal  we have added a baked specialties menu to each of our restaurants 
the baked specialties menu includes some of our most popular baked specials  such as baked ravioli  cannelloni  manicotti  and stuffed shells 
besides the baked specialties  every restaurant offers from two to five specials every day 
these daily specials are selected from a list of approximately recipes 
both the baked specialties and daily specials are priced higher than normal menu items and generate higher margins 
also in  we introduced our buca per due menu  which means buca for two  at our buca di beppo restaurants 
these new menu offerings  which marry portions of our baked specialties with several of our most popular entr e items  such as chicken with lemon  or eggplant  chicken or veal parmigiana  are served on our traditional family style platters  allowing groups of two to four diners to enjoy a wider selection of our fabulous food each time they visit 
in prior years  the vinny testa s restaurants have averaged approximately million in sales and approximately restaurant level cash flow 
the average vinny testa s restaurant is approximately  square feet and seats approximately guests 
the restaurants are open for lunch and dinner seven days a week 
we expect to continue to grow the vinny testa s concept by one to two new restaurants in fiscal the prototype for the new vinny testas s restaurants will be approximately  square feet and seat approximately guests 
we expect that each new restaurant will cost approximately  in leasehold improvements and  in furniture and equipment 
these cash investment amounts assume that we lease the land and building and receive approximately  or per foot  in tenant improvement allowances 
we also expect to incur approximately  in preopening costs that we will expense as incurred 
compared to the buca di beppo restaurants  the vinny testa s restaurants generate higher average unit volumes but lower cash flow as a percentage of sales primarily due to the relative lower margin lunch sales 
lunch sales  in general  produce higher total product cost  lower liquor mix  higher labor costs and higher direct and occupancy costs  all as a percentage of sales 
our fiscal results will compare the combined company results this year with the buca di beppo results only in fiscal due to the different unit level economics  we expect that the addition of the vinny testa s restaurants alone would result in a slight increase in average weekly sales  and increases in total product  labor and direct and occupancy costs of approximately one half percent of sales each 
we implemented a price increase of approximately one percent at our buca di beppo restaurants during march the price increase is expected to cause product cost and labor cost at our buca di beppo restaurants to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared with fiscal our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
our calculation of comparable restaurant sales includes restaurants open for full calendar months 
product costs include the costs of food and beverages 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems and training and market research 
special charges include an asset impairment charge of approximately million primarily related to our lowest sales volume restaurant 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
interest expense includes the cost of interest expense on debt and interest income includes the interest income on invested assets 
results of operations our operating results for the week period ended december   week period ended december  and week period ended december  expressed as a percentage of sales were as follows fiscal year ended december  december  december  restaurant sales restaurant costs product labor direct and occupancy depreciation and amortization total restaurant costs general and administrative expenses pre opening costs special charges operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes and other week fiscal year ended december  compared to week fiscal year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributable to million of restaurant sales at new restaurants  offset by comparable restaurants sales decreases of  and an extra week s worth of sales in fiscal after adjusting for the extra week of sales in fiscal  sales would have increased million  or percent 
comparable restaurant sales decreased by percent in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in guest visits of percent  offset by an approximate one percent price increase in january for fiscal  we expect comparable restaurants sales to increase one to two percent based upon an increase in guest counts and a price increase of approximately one percent effective in march of we expect comparable restaurant sales to be negative in the first quarter  flat to slightly positive in the second quarter and up three to five percent for the remainder of the year 
product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  management s efforts to reduce costs  especially at newer restaurants  a continued shift in sales to baked specialties and specials that have higher product margins  and the price increase at the beginning of the year 
we expect product costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal to be comparable with fiscal the expected decrease in buca di beppo s product cost resulting from the continued shift in sales to higher margin products  continued improvement in purchasing contracts  management s efforts to reduce costs at newer restaurants and the price increase implemented in march of will be offset by the expected higher product costs at our vinny testa s restaurants 
labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs remained constant as a percentage of sales at percent in fiscal and an improvement in hourly labor as a percentage of sales was offset by the increase as a percentage of sales of primarily fixed management payroll and benefits costs 
the increase in management payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales was due to the decline in average weekly sales 
we expect labor costs to increase slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal although we expect a slight decrease in labor costs as a percentage of sales at our buca di beppo restaurants  it will be offset by the higher labor costs as a percentage of sales at our vinny testa s restaurants 
direct and occupancy 
direct and occupancy costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the increase in direct and occupancy costs  which are primarily fixed in nature  as a percentage of sales was directly related to the decline in average weekly sales and one less week worth of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate direct and occupancy costs to increase slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared with fiscal the expected increase is due to rising insurance costs  the addition of the vinny testa s restaurants which have a higher direct and occupancy cost as a percentage of sales than a buca di beppo restaurant  offset by an expected increase in average weekly sales 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of depreciation recognized on capital expenditures for an increasing number of new restaurants 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the decline in average weekly sales 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollars in the future  but decrease as a percentage of sales because our expansion plans will require proportionately smaller incremental increases in general and administrative expenses 
pre opening costs 
pre opening costs decreased by  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal pre opening costs decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in pre opening costs as a percentage of sales is due to the opening of restaurants on a base of restaurants in fiscal compared to opening restaurants on a base of restaurants in fiscal and management s efforts to reduce these costs to our model of  per new restaurant opening 
we expect that pre opening costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal as we expect to open new buca di beppo restaurants on a base of buca di beppo restaurants and nine vinny testa s restaurants 
interest income 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in income is related to a higher amount of invested assets during the year 
we expect that interest income will decrease in fiscal due to a lower amount of invested assets 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to minimal borrowings on our line of credit during fiscal we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal due to borrowings on our million term loan  which was used to finance our vinny testa s acquisition  and on our line of credit facility 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million in fiscal represents our estimated tax liability for the year 
our tax rate has increased from fiscal primarily due to increased state income taxes and the reduced impact of the income tax credit we receive for social security paid on reported tips 
we expect that our provision for income taxes will increase to percent of pre tax income in fiscal week fiscal year ended december  compared to week fiscal year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributable to million of restaurant sales at new restaurants opened in fiscal  full year sales on restaurants opened in and an extra week s worth of sales in fiscal after adjusting for the extra week of sales in fiscal  sales would have increased million  or percent 
comparable restaurant sales increased by percent in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in guest visits of approximately percent  a shift in product mix from lower to higher priced items  and an approximate percent price increase in january product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  management s efforts to reduce costs  especially at newer restaurants  a continued shift in sales to specials which have higher product margins and the price increase at the beginning of the year 
labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in percentage of sales resulted from greater operating efficiencies on higher restaurant sales volumes and an increased percentage of sales coming from restaurants operating in states with minimum wage tip credit 
direct and occupancy 
direct and occupancy costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct and occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was due mainly to the increase in comparable restaurant sales and the extra week of sales  which leverages the fixed component of direct and occupancy costs  principally fixed rent  real estate taxes and utilities 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of depreciation recognized on capital expenditures for an increasing number of new restaurants 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales resulted from higher total sales 
pre opening costs 
pre opening costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal pre opening costs decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in pre opening costs as a percentage of sales is due to the opening of restaurants on a base of restaurants in fiscal compared to opening restaurants on a base of restaurants in fiscal interest income 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in income is related to a higher amount of invested assets during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively constant at  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal represents our estimated tax liability for the year 
the benefit from income taxes for fiscal was  of this  was recognized in the benefit from income taxes and  was offset against extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt 
the benefit represents the net effect of approximately  recorded for our net operating loss carry forwards less  of certain minimum state taxes based upon factors other than earnings 
the majority of these operating loss carry forwards were utilized in fiscal the remaining net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities in future periods 
we use cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal we opened buca di beppo restaurants in both fiscal and fiscal each new leased restaurant is expected to require  on average  a total cash investment of between million and million  excluding pre opening costs expected to be approximately  for a buca di beppo and  for a vinny testa s restaurant 
prior to  the majority of our restaurants were renovations of existing facilities ranging in size from  to  square feet 
we anticipate that future restaurants will typically range in size from  to  square feet 
beginning in  we began building restaurants based upon our prototype designs 
these designs are expected to require between million to million in total cash investment per restaurant 
this investment represents an incremental  increase over the historical cash investment for remodeled restaurants 
however  the rental cost on these restaurants is also significantly lower than on remodeled restaurants  as our lease costs relate to the land only and not the building 
in the future  we may refinance any purchases of land or buildings through sale leaseback transactions 
we cannot predict whether this financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal financing activities in fiscal and consisted primarily of the sales of equity securities 
in march  we completed a private placement of our common stock for approximately million in net proceeds 
the proceeds were used primarily to develop new restaurants and for general corporate purposes 
in january  we amended our credit facility to include a million term loan and a million line of credit with the option to borrow an additional million provided we are not in default under the terms of the agreement 
the credit facility expires on december  the credit facility bears interest at the lower of our lenders reference rate plus percent to percent or libor plus percent to percent percent to percent as of march   dependent upon our meeting certain financial ratios 
we are required to pay percent on all unused line of credit funds 
the credit agreement contains covenants that place restrictions on sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures and other customary covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
we do not anticipate that the above covenants and restrictions will have a significant impact upon us 
as of march   we had million outstanding in debt borrowings 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we will need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
the adequacy of available funds and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  the costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development and the nature of contributions  loans and other arrangements negotiated with landlords 
although we can make no assurance  we believe that our available cash  cash flows from operations  and our available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements through at least to fund future operations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing to continue our growth 
in addition  we have and may continue to consider acquiring the operations of other companies 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot predict whether additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases long term debt payments include obligations for the million term loan we entered into in january and a loan related to one of our restaurant landlords 
operating lease payments include obligations on the executed leases as of december  and the nine leases acquired in the vinny testa s acquisition in january see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for details of our contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include accounts of buca  inc and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have used our best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policy described below 
however  application of this accounting policy involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets  intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
we consider a history of consistent and significant operating losses to be a primary indicator of potential asset impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  the individual restaurants 
a restaurant is deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the restaurant is less than its carrying amount 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation techniques such as discounted estimated future cash flows as if the decision to continue to use the impaired restaurant was a new investment decision 
recent accounting pronouncements on january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
we have reviewed the requirements of sfas no 
and have determined that we have no material freestanding or embedded derivatives 
on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb approved sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations subsequent to june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we accounted for our acquisition of vinny testa s under sfas no 
sfas no 
requires cessation of goodwill  liquor license  and trademark amortization and periodic evaluation of their carrying value for asset impairment 
we have adopted sfas no 
for fiscal in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model related to the evaluation of impairment for long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us in fiscal year  and generally  are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the impact of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor and utility costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving line of credit that bears interest at the lower of our lender s reference rate plus percent to percent or libor plus percent to percent 
because we do not believe that changes in interest rates from the maximum available borrowings under the revolving line of credit are material  we do not believe this risk will be material 
as of march   we had million outstanding in debt borrowings 
we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in investment grade  highly liquid investments  consisting of money market instruments  bank certificates of deposit  overnight investments in commercial paper  and short term government and corporate bonds 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control 
to control this risk in part  we have fixed price purchase commitments with terms of one year or less for food and supplies from vendors who supply our national food distributor 
in addition  we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we believe we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  if needed  in response to a food product price increase 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of percent for food and beverages  we would need to increase menu prices by an average of percent  which is consistent with our average price increases of approximately percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal accordingly  we believe that a hypothetical percent increase in food product costs would not have a material effect on our operating results
