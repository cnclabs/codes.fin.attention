see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our operating segments and geographic information 
technology we specialize in analytics  software and data management technologies that analyze data and drive business processes and decision strategies 
we maintain active research in a number of fields for the purposes of deriving greater insight and predictive value from data  making various forms of data more usable and valuable to the model building process  and automating and applying analytics to the various processes involved in making high volume decisions in real time 
because of our pioneering work in credit scoring and 
table of contents fraud detection  we are widely recognized as the leader in predictive technology 
in all our work  we believe that our tools and processes are among the very best commercially available  and that we are uniquely able to integrate advanced analytic  software and data technologies into mission critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment 
some of our longer term research projects are partially funded through contracts with the us government or members of the us intelligence community 
our areas of expertise encompass predictive modeling 
predictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data in order to explain the data and make predictions or classifications about future events 
our models summarize large quantities of data to amplify its value 
predictive models typically analyze current and historical data on individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores 
these scores rank order individuals by likely future performance  eg  their likelihood of making credit payments on time  or of responding to a particular offer for services 
we also include in this category models that detect the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent 
our predictive models are frequently operationalized in mission critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time 
while we employ a wide range of analytic methodologies and tools in this area  we have two principal technologies behind most of our predictive models inform 
this is our proprietary predictive modeling technology 
it is unique in its ability to account for business rules  legal environments  and real world biased or missing values 
fair  isaac has continuously evolved inform since the late s  adding new algorithms and processes 
the name  inform  was coined to reflect its information theory root 
although the modeling component is proprietary and closely protected  the present version of inform inform is based upon a linear goal programming approach 
as such  it allows for such operations research capabilities as linear constrained optimization 
the latest generation of inform inform nlp utilizes a non linear constrained optimization algorithm 
it provides the foundation for an extensible modeling technology that can accommodate an even wider variety of objective functions  still subject to business and data constraints 
this reflects our focus on analytic solutions that address real world problems 
neural networks 
the term neural network refers to a family of nonlinear  statistical modeling techniques  which were derived from the work of scientists engaged in understanding biological intelligence 
we use neural network techniques to build models of complex transaction patterns such as consumer credit card fraud 
these models are created through a process called training 
training involves exposing a neural network algorithm to a large data set of examples of transaction patterns 
often hundreds of thousands to millions of examples are provided 
the neural network processes this data to identify patterns in the data that are predictive of the transaction patterns being modeled 
once training is complete  the neural network uses these learned patterns to predict the probability that a new individual will exhibit the modeled transaction patterns 
decision analysis and optimization 
decision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field  that overlaps the fields of operations research and statistics  that deals with modeling  optimizing and analyzing decisions made by individuals  groups and organizations 
whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior  decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result 
we have developed an integrated approach to decision analysis that incorporates the development of a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure  proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies  given both the performance objective and constraints  the development of designed testing required for active  continuous learning  and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered 
this technology is behind our strategy science solutions 

table of contents transaction profiling 
many of our products operate on transactional data  such as credit card purchase transactions  or other types of data that change over time  such as workers compensation claims 
in its raw form  this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons first  a single transaction contains very little information about the transaction patterns of the individual that generated the transaction 
second  transaction patterns change rapidly over time 
finally  this type of data can often be incomplete 
to overcome these data problems  we have developed a set of proprietary techniques that transform raw transactional data into a representation that reveals latent information  and which make the data more usable by predictive models 
this profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions to create and update profiles of transaction patterns 
these profiles enable our neural network models to make accurate assessments of fraud and risk within real time transaction streams 
customer data integration 
decisions made on customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources  both inside and outside the enterprise 
we have focused on developing data integration processes that are able to assemble and integrate those disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer or household for real time decision making 
as an advance on our own internal tools for merge purge processes using multiple match keys  we have co developed a proprietary matching logic with equifax 
using this logic  we quickly integrate customer data from many different enterprise touchpoints  and append data from external sources  including demographic databases  opt out lists and the more than billion consumer records in equifax s comprehensive database 
decision management software 
in order to make a decision strategy operational  the various steps and rules need to be programmed or exported into the business s software infrastructure  where it can communicate with front end  customer facing systems and back end systems such as billing systems 
we have developed software systems  sometimes known as decision engines and rules management systems  that perform the necessary functions to execute a decision strategy 
our software includes very efficient programs for these functions  facilitating  for example  user definition of extremely complex decision strategies using gui interfaces  simultaneous testing of hundreds of decision strategies in test control mode  high volume processing and analysis of transactions in real time  and integration of multiple data sources and predictive metrics for improved behavior forecasts and finer segmentation 
research and development activities 
our research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continually maintain and improve our core technologies  enhance our existing products  and develop new products and technologies that meet an expanding range of markets and customer requirements 
in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  we use our own development tools extensively 
we have traditionally relied primarily on the internal development of our products 
based on timing and cost considerations  however  we have acquired  and in the future may consider acquiring  technology or products from third parties 
in some cases  external funding eg  government grants is used to develop initial concepts 
for example  the defense advanced research projects agency  or darpa  funds our development of advanced computational intelligence algorithms to detect patterns in genomic and medical literature data 
another long term research project is aimed at developing computer models of brain functions in order to develop more intelligent  interactive computing systems and new types of analytic algorithms

revenues the following table displays a the percentage of revenues by segment and b the percentage change in revenues from the prior fiscal year for the fiscal periods indicated 
period to period percentage change percentage of revenues fiscal year to to segment scoring solutions strategy machine solutions professional services analytic software tools total revenues the growth in scoring solutions segment revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to an increase in revenues derived from risk and insurance scoring services at the credit reporting agencies  offset by a decrease in prescore and scorenet services 
the growth in risk scoring services resulted primarily from increased sales of scores for account review and increased online scores for auto financing  as well as a continued strong market for mortgage originations and refinancing 
the increase in scoring solutions revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in revenues derived from risk scoring services at the credit reporting agencies  driven predominantly by increased marketing efforts of credit card issuers  and in part by a stronger market for mortgage refinancing in fiscal as compared to fiscal while we have been successful in extending or renewing our agreements with credit reporting agencies and credit card processors in the past  and believe we will likely be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a material adverse effect on revenues and operating margins 
in fiscal  revenues generated from our alliances with experian  transunion and equifax accounted for approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  equifax  transunion and experian accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  respectively  and in fiscal  transunion  equifax and experian accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in strategy machine solutions segment revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to increased revenues derived from marketsmart  consumer score service revenues through myfico 
com and strategic alliance partners web sites  our strategy science offering  netsourced and processor triad products  and the addition of products previously offered by hnc  offset by a decrease in revenues from list processing  maintenance on retired products  creditdesk and strategyware 
revenues derived from the strategy machine solutions segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to the addition of consumer score service revenues through myfico 
com and increased revenues from liquid credit  strategyware and processor triad 
the increase in professional services revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to increased revenues resulting from the acquisitions of the nykamp and hnc businesses as well as increased revenues derived from consulting services related to triad  marketsmart  strategy science  blaze decision 
table of contents system  and strategyware 
revenues derived from the professional services segment in fiscal decreased slightly as compared to fiscal  due mainly to a decrease in consulting related to strategy machines solutions products  offset by an increase in analytic consulting 
the increase in analytic software tools segment revenues in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to the addition of blaze advisor revenues previously offered by hnc and to additional revenues from blaze decision system formerly fair  isaac decision system  offset by a decrease in the sale of model builder for decision trees 
tools revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due principally to increased revenues from blaze decision system and strategy designer products 
revenues derived from clients outside the united states totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total consolidated revenues in these years  respectively 
the increase in international revenues in fiscal resulted primarily from increased sales of our triad and decision system products and strategy science services  offset by a decrease in international credit bureau scoring revenue 
in fiscal  the increase in international revenues resulted primarily from increased sales of our strategy machines solutions products  including strategyware and the increased usage of our processor triad product 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not had a significant effect on revenues to date 
in october  we initiated a hedging program to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency translation rates resulting from holding receivables and cash denominated in foreign currencies within our us reporting entities 
operating expenses and other income expense the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
period to period percentage change percentage of revenues fiscal year to to revenues operating expenses cost of revenues research and development sales  general and administrative amortization of intangibles in process research and development restructuring and merger related total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense on convertible subordinated notes other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits for personnel directly involved in creating  installing and supporting revenue products  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and our payments made to credit reporting agencies for scores  related outside support in connection with the scorenet service and expenses related to our consumer score services through myfico 
com 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  increased in each of fiscal and over the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the nykamp and hnc businesses and to an increase in direct materials expenses associated with our consumer score services through myfico 
com  offset by a reduction in the use of outside consultants and contractors that are relatively more expensive than internal resources 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to higher operating costs incurred for telecommunications services  planning and compliance functions and software and consulting services related to the north american market 
research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in development of new products and services  including research of mathematical and statistical models  and the development of other strategy machines solutions and analytic software tools 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were consistent between fiscal and fiscal as a percentage of revenues  the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year was due primarily to the redeployment of research and development personnel to support roles for our new products  particularly within our strategy machine solutions segment 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee salaries and benefits  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses  corporate facilities expenses  legal expenses  business development expenses  and the cost of operating computer systems 
as a percentage of revenues  sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were lower than in fiscal  due primarily to a reduction in personnel  consulting  sales commission  conference and trade show expenses  offset in part by increased personnel and other expenses resulting from the hnc acquisition 
as a percentage of revenues  sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were lower than in fiscal  due primarily to reductions in personnel  consulting and travel expenses as a result of our cost containment efforts 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles consists of amortization expense that we have recorded on intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
amortization expense in fiscal totaled million as compared to amortization expense of million in each of fiscal and the increase in fiscal is attributable primarily to the incremental amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the hnc acquisition on august   and to a lesser degree the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from nykamp consulting group  inc nykamp in december our intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to fifteen years 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in process research and development during fiscal  we recorded in process research and development ipr d expense of million in connection with our acquisition of hnc 
ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet 
table of contents reached technological feasibility 
the classification of the technology as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
applicability of sfas no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in addition  the fair value  as defined below  of the ipr d projects was determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations  and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we used an independent appraisal firm to assist us with our valuation of the fair value of the assets purchased from hnc 
fair value is defined as the price at which property would expect to be exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell  and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
hnc s ipr d projects consisted of projects within hnc s three legacy suites of software  consisting of the efficiency  risk and opportunity suites  as well as its development of a new software platform technology 
the current efficiency suite products under development as of the acquisition date were roamex  which replaces of the existing roamex code and adds additional capabilities  and blaze advisor  a business rules product that adds additional rules management features to this product line 
the current risk suite products under development were falcon  which will be the first project in a series to replace the legacy falcon product code base with new java and platform technology  and payment optimizer  a payment optimizer tool that incorporates new platform modeling and profiling components 
the current opportunity suite product under development was opportunity suite development osd 
osd was the core engine for this suite  and was a build out of the optimization and simulation environment ose application version unix based running on a web browser 
at the time of acquisition  hnc was also in the process of developing a new software platform technology that enables efficient deployment and installation of multiple products while significantly reducing implementation and development costs 
the ipr d projects were valued through the application of discounted cash flow analyses  taking into account many key characteristics of hnc as well as its future prospects  the rate of technological change in the industry  product life cycles  risks specific to each project  and various projects stage of completion 
stage of completion was estimated by considering the time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition  verses the project s overall expected cost  effort and risks required for achieving technological feasibility 
in the application of the discounted cash flow analyses  hnc s management provided distinct revenue forecasts for each ipr d project 
the projections were based on the expected date of market introduction  an assessment of customer needs  the expected pricing and cost structure of the related product s  product life cycles  and the importance of the existing technology relative to the in process technology 
in addition  the costs expected to complete each project were added to the operating expenses to calculate the operating income for each ipr d project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the assets being valued  returns to these other assets were calculated and deducted from the pre tax operating income to isolate the economic benefit solely attributable to each of the in process technologies 
the present value of ipr d was calculated based on discount rates recommended by the american institute of certified public accountants ipr d practice aid  which depend on the stage of completion and the additional risk associated with the completion of each of the ipr d projects 
as a recommended basis for the valuation of technology under development  we considered venture capital rates of return as an appropriate measure of the discount rates associated with each ipr d project 
as a result  the earnings associated with the incomplete technology were discounted at a rate ranging from to 
restructuring and merger related during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of hnc  we incurred charges totaling million  consisting of the following i million in restructuring charges  including million in charges associated with our abandonment of a fair  isaac facility lease concurrent with the merger  representing future cash obligations under the lease net of estimated sublease income  and million in severance costs associated with a reduction in fair  isaac staff in connection with the merger  and ii million in other 
table of contents non recurring merger related costs  consisting primarily of retention bonuses earned through september  by employees with future severance dates and employee outplacement costs 
in october  we announced the discontinuance of our healthcare receivables management system product line  and in connection therewith recorded a restructuring charge totaling million during fiscal we also recorded a restructuring charge totaling million related to a reduction in staff during fiscal these restructuring actions were completed during fiscal and resulted in a combined restructuring charge of million in fiscal  million of which related to the write down of operating assets 
at september   we had an outstanding restructuring liability of million related to these charges  which was included in other accrued liabilities 
during fiscal  we made cash payments of million and wrote off million in remaining operating assets such that no remaining restructuring liability existed at september  interest income interest income increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements 
interest income increased in both fiscal and  due primarily to higher average cash and investment balances  partially offset by lower interest and investment income yields due to market conditions 
also contributing to the increase in interest income in fiscal was the contribution of hnc s cash and investment balances as a result of our acquisition of hnc on august  interest expense on convertible subordinated notes as a result of the hnc acquisition and subsequent liquidation of the hnc entity  we are the issuer of million in convertible subordinated notes due in september the notes were recorded at their fair value of million on the acquisition date  as determined based on their quoted market price  which resulted in our recognition of a million note discount 
the carrying amount of the notes is being accreted to million over their remaining term using the effective interest method  resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately per annum 
interest expense on the notes recorded by us totaled million during fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of realized investment gains losses  exchange rate gains losses resulting from re measurement of foreign denominated receivable and cash balances held by our us reporting entities into the us dollar functional currency at period end market rates  net of the impact of offsetting forward exchange contracts  and other non operating items 
other income expense  net was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income expense  net in fiscal includes million in realized gains on the sale of investments  whereas investment gains losses were insignificant in fiscal and in fiscal and  we also recorded our share of losses in an early stage development company accounted for using the equity method  as well as net foreign currency losses 
in fiscal  we entered into a lease arrangement to construct an office complex in san rafael  california to accommodate future growth 
during fiscal  we decided not to build out the site as planned following a five month study of our options 
under an agreement with the san rafael city government  we were released from our obligation to occupy buildings on the site 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded a loss of approximately million  which is reflected in other income expense  net in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million non deductible ipr d charge  offset by the reduction of valuation allowance on capital loss carryovers and an increased level of research and development tax credits 
the effective tax rate net of the ipr d adjustment would have been 
table of contents 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the implementation of an extraterritorial income exclusion tax structure and relatively more income generating activities in states with lower tax rates 
operating income operating income in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the ipr d charge and other merger related costs recorded in connection with the hnc acquisition 
excluding these charges  operating income in fiscal increased  due principally to increased segment operating income derived from our strategy machines solutions  scoring solutions and analytic software tools segments  offset by a decrease in professional services segment operating income 
the fiscal increase in strategy machines solutions segment operating income was due primarily to the increase in revenues from consumer score services through myfico 
com and strategic alliance partners web sites 
the increase in scoring solutions segment operating income was due primarily to the growth in risk and insurance scoring revenues from the credit reporting agencies 
the increase in analytic software tools segment operating income was due primarily to an increase in blaze decision system and blaze advisor revenues in fiscal  the latter of which resulted from the hnc acquisition 
the decrease in the professional services segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions of nykamp and hnc  which contributed to lower professional services margins  offset by the increase in professional service revenue contributions from these acquisitions 
operating income in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased segment operating income within our strategy machines solutions and scoring solutions segments  and to a decline in the analytic software tools segment operating loss 
the increased strategy machines solutions segment operating income was attributable primarily to the introduction in fiscal of consumer score services through myfico 
com and to the elimination of lower operating margins associated with our former healthcare receivables management system line of business  which was discontinued in fiscal the increase in the scoring solutions segment operating income was due primarily to increased revenues related to risk scores from the credit reporting agencies 
the decline in the analytic software tools segment operating loss was due principally to increased revenues from blaze decision system products and to a lower percentage increase of segment operating expenses 
capital resources and liquidity our working capital at september  and totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital year over year is attributable mainly to an increase in cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and accounts receivable  primarily resulting from our acquisition of hnc 
our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operations 
net operating cash flows increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting primarily an increase in net earnings before merger related ipr d and other non cash charges  partially offset by the effect of net working capital changes excluding the impact of the hnc and nykamp acquisitions 
net operating cash flows increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting primarily an increase in net earnings before non cash charges  partially offset by net working capital changes 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows from investing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable primarily to the acquisition of million of hnc cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in purchases of marketable securities  net of sales and maturities year over year  partly offset by cash paid to effect the nykamp acquisition in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to an increase in purchases of marketable securities  net of sales and maturities  partially offset by a decline in purchases of property and equipment year over year 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is attributable primarily to a increase in stock repurchases  a decrease in proceeds from issuances of common stock and an increase in cash dividends paid year over year 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to an increase in proceeds from issuances of common stock  partially offset by an increase in stock repurchases year over year 
from time to time  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
during fiscal  and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our repurchase of common stock under such programs 
in august  we announced a million share repurchase program 
when the current program was announced  we stated an expectation that the volume of repurchases would be made in amounts consistent with the previous quarter s free cash flow and that the program would have a term of up to three years 
in november  our board of directors determined that it is in the company s best interest to have the discretion to accelerate the rate of repurchase activity and that the company should not be subject to restrictions on the rate of repurchases or the duration of the program 
as of september   approximately million shares of our common stock had been repurchased under the current program 
we anticipate that we will continue to repurchase shares in accordance with this program 
we paid quarterly dividends of two cents per share  or eight cents per year  during each of fiscal  and our dividend rate is set by the board of directors on a quarterly basis taking into account a variety of factors  including among others  our operating results and cash flows  general economic and industry conditions  our obligations and other factors deemed relevant by the board 
although we expect to continue to pay dividends at the current rate  our dividend rate is subject to change from time to time based on the board s business judgment with respect to these and other relevant factors 
in connection with our merger with hnc and the subsequent liquidation of the hnc entity  we are the issuer of  of convertible subordinated notes that mature on september  the notes are convertible into shares of fair  isaac common stock at a conversion rate of approximately shares of fair  isaac common stock per  principal amount of the notes  subject to anti dilution adjustment 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of fair  isaac and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of fair  isaac 
interest on the notes is payable on march and september of each year until maturity 
we may redeem the notes on or after september   or earlier if the price of fair  isaac common stock reaches certain levels 
if we redeem the notes prior to september   we will also be required to pay a redemption premium as prescribed by the indenture 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the current decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
we are party to a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a million revolving line of credit through february under the agreement we are required to comply with various financial covenants which include but are not limited to  minimum levels of domestic liquidity  parameters for treasury stock repurchases  dividend payments  and merger and acquisition requirements 
at our option  borrowings under this agreement bear interest at the rate of libor plus or at the financial institution s prime 
table of contents rate  payable monthly 
this agreement  executed in november  replaces a former million revolving credit facility that was held by hnc 
as of september   the former hnc credit facility served to collateralize certain letters of credit aggregating million  made by us in the normal course of business 
these letters of credit are now collateralized by the new facility 
our available borrowings under this facility are reduced by the principal amount of letters of credit collateralized by this credit agreement 
we are a limited partner in azure capital partners lp  a venture capital investment management fund 
we are committed to invest an additional million into this fund  and we expect to make this additional investment in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  capitalized software development costs  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize software license revenue upon delivery  provided all significant obligations have been met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  collections are probable  and we are not involved in significant production  customization  or modification of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
if the arrangement involves development of custom scoring systems or significant production  customization  or modification of software or service essential to the functionality of the software  the revenue is generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
progress toward completion is generally measured by achieving certain standards and objectively verifiable milestones present in each project 
in order to apply the percentage of completion of method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revenues from multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to our business 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
if in a multiple element arrangement  fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  but fair value does exist for all of the undelivered elements  then the residual method of accounting is applied 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue determined by the percentage of completion method in excess of contract billings is recorded as unbilled work in progress 
such amounts are generally billable upon reaching certain performance milestones as defined by individual contracts 
billings received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as billings in excess of earned revenues 
revenues recognized from our credit scoring  data processing  data management  internet delivery services and consulting are generally recognized as these services are performed  provided all significant 
table of contents obligations have been met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  and collections are probable 
transactional based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized as revenue based on system usage or when fees based on system usage exceed monthly minimum license fees 
revenues from post contract customer support  such as maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we closely analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  and in certain cases one time charges associated with the write off of in process research and development  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of enterprise level goodwill 
if factors suggesting impairment exist  we use the market value method to determine the extent of the impairment 
we will adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  and as a result we will cease to amortize all goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an initial impairment review based on the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets as of october  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
there are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
we have not yet determined whether any impairment loss will result from our initial impairment review in fiscal capitalized software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs after establishment of a product s technological feasibility 
such costs are then amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s estimated net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized costs exceed net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future costs of completing and disposing of certain products 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
internal use software costs incurred to develop internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
application development stage costs generally include 
table of contents costs associated with internal use software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred 
we assess potential impairment to capitalized internal use software whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to product  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment circumstances arise 
sfas no 
is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december   therefore  the company will adopt sfas beginning october  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of its operations 
annual goodwill amortization was approximately million for each of the fiscal years  and in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
revises the accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities and allows recognition of a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
this statement only applies to termination benefits offered for a specific termination event or a specified period 
we are required to adopt this statement for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors although we expect that the recently completed merger between fair  isaac and hnc will benefit us  we may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges 
on august   we completed the acquisition of hnc  previously announced on april  our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of fair  isaac and hnc or 
table of contents otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the recently completed merger  including anticipated cost savings  could seriously harm our results of operations 
realizing the benefits of the recently completed merger will depend in part on the continued integration of products  technologies  operations  and personnel 
although we have made progress since the merger was completed  the continued integration is a complex  time consuming and expensive process that  even with proper planning and implementation  could significantly disrupt our business 
in many recent mergers  especially mergers involving technology companies  merger partners have experienced difficulties integrating the combined businesses  and we have not previously faced an integration challenge as substantial as the one presented by the recently completed merger 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following continuing to persuade employees that the business cultures of fair  isaac and hnc are compatible  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees  managing a workforce over expanded geographic locations  demonstrating to our customers that the merger will not lower client service standards  interfere with business focus  adversely affect product quality or alter current product development plans  consolidating and rationalizing corporate it and administrative infrastructures  combining product offerings  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate our capabilities to current and prospective customers  coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of well designed new products and technologies  preserving our marketing or other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may arise  minimizing the diversion of management attention from other ongoing business concerns  and coordinating and combining overseas operations  relationships and facilities  which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws and regulations 
we may not successfully integrate the operations of fair  isaac and hnc in a timely manner  or at all 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent  or in the time frame  anticipated 
the anticipated benefits and synergies relate to cost savings associated with anticipated restructurings and other operational efficiencies  greater economies of scale and revenue growth opportunities through expanded markets and cross sell opportunities 
however  these anticipated benefits and synergies are based on projections and assumptions  not actual experience  and assume a successful integration 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may cause the market value of our common stock to decline 
in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  we are accounting for the merger using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have allocated the total estimated purchase price to hnc s net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite lives and in process research and development  based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger on august  we have recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
we have expensed approximately million of the estimated purchase price allocated to in process research and development in the fourth quarter 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the merger 
annual amortization of intangible assets is currently estimated at million  as compared to our amortization expense for such items during our most recent completed fiscal year of million 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired in the future  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of 
table of contents those assets 
these depreciation  amortization  in process research and development and potential impairment charges could seriously harm our results of operations 
we may incur significant liabilities and merger related charges resulting from integration of the two companies following the recently completed restructuring 
we recognized approximately million of merger related and restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year however  additional liabilities ultimately will be recorded for severance  retention or relocation costs  costs of vacating some facilities  or other costs associated with ceasing certain activities 
these liabilities and charges may be significant and could seriously harm our operating results in future periods 
customer uncertainties related to the recently completed merger could harm our businesses and results of operations 
since the merger we have been communicating our future plans to our customers 
despite these efforts there may be customer uncertainty  causing our customers to delay or defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to other suppliers 
in particular  prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase our products due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and our willingness to support and service existing products 
prospective and current clients may worry about how integration of the two companies technologies may affect current and future products 
to the extent that the recently completed merger creates uncertainty among those persons and organizations contemplating product purchases such that one large customer  or a significant group of smaller customers  delays  defers or changes purchases  our results of operations would be seriously harmed 
further  we may have to make additional customer assurances and assume additional obligations to address our customers uncertainty about the direction of our products and related support offerings 
accordingly  our quarterly results of operations could be substantially below expectations of market analysts  potentially decreasing our stock price 
our effective tax rate after the recently completed merger is uncertain  and any increase in tax liability would harm our operating results 
the impact of the recently completed merger on our overall effective tax rate is uncertain 
although we will attempt to optimize our overall effective tax rate  it is difficult to predict our effective tax rate following the recently completed merger 
the combination of the operations of fair  isaac and hnc may result in an overall effective tax rate that is higher than our currently reported tax rate  and it is possible that our combined effective tax rate on a consolidated basis may exceed the average of the pre merger separate tax rates of fair  isaac and hnc 
we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth rates previously experienced by hnc and fair  isaac individually 
we cannot assure you that we will experience the same rate of revenue growth following the recently completed merger as hnc and fair  isaac experienced individually because of the difficulty of maintaining high percentage increases as the base of revenue increases 
if our revenue does not increase at or above the rate analysts expect  the trading price for our common stock may decline 
any failure to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel  more challenging in light of uncertainty following the recent acquisition  could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business 
our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced sales  research and development  marketing  technical support and management personnel 
employee retention may be particularly challenging in connection with the recently completed acquisition as a result of employee uncertainty about their future roles  the distractions of integration  and morale challenges posed by workforce reductions that occurred after completion of the acquisition 
moreover  the complexity of our products requires highly trained customer service and technical support personnel to assist customers with product 
table of contents installation and deployment 
the labor market for these persons is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding 
we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially technical and sales personnel  and we may need additional staff to support new customers and or increased customer needs 
we may also recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could hinder our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel and harm our business and future operating results 
there is a risk that even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we will not succeed in our efforts  and our business could be harmed 
since our revenues depend  to a great extent upon conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  and to some extent on general economic conditions  an industry specific or general downturn may harm our results of operations 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from sales of products and services to the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries 
a downturn in the consumer credit  the financial services or the insurance industry  including a downturn caused by increases in interest rates or a tightening of credit  among other factors  could harm our results of operations 
since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of our large institutional clients have merged and consolidated  we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard related scoring and account management businesses by selling and cross selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers 
as this industry continues to consolidate  we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth due to changing demand for our products and services that support clients customer acquisition programs 
in addition  industry consolidation could affect the base of recurring revenues derived from contracts in which we are paid on a per transaction basis if consolidated customers combine their operations under one contract 
we cannot assure you that we will be able effectively to promote future revenue growth in our businesses 
in addition  a softening of demand for our decisioning solutions or other products and services caused by a weakening of the economy generally may result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
due to the current slowdown in the economy generally  we believe that many of our existing and potential customers are reassessing or reducing their planned technology investments and deferring purchasing decisions 
as a result  there is increased uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues 
further delays or reductions in business spending for business analytics could seriously harm our revenues and operating results 
quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and this unpredictability may continue in the future and could lead to substantial declines in the market price for our common stock 
our revenues and operating results varied in the past and future fluctuations in our operating results are possible 
consequently  we believe that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of financial results as an indication of future performance 
our future operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  and in this event the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
in addition  most of our operating expenses will not be affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may significantly impact operating results 
factors that will affect our revenues and operating results include the following variability in demand from our existing customers  the lengthy and variable sales cycle of many products  consumer dissatisfaction with  or problems caused by  the performance of our products  the relatively large size of orders for our products and our inability to compensate for unanticipated revenue shortfalls  the timing of new product announcements and introductions in comparison with our competitors  
table of contents the level of our operating expenses  changes in competitive conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions  our ability to complete large installations on schedule and within budget  acquisition related expenses and charges  and timing of orders for and deliveries of software systems 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our products have a long and variable sales cycle 
we cannot predict the timing of the recognition of our revenues accurately because the length of our sales cycles makes it difficult for us to predict the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the sales cycle to license our products can typically range from days to months 
customers are often cautious in making decisions to acquire our products  because purchasing our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital  and may involve shifts by the customer to a new software and or hardware platform or changes in the customer s operational procedures 
delays in completing sales can arise while customers complete their internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures and test and accept our applications 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur 
this has contributed  and we expect it to continue to contribute  to fluctuations in our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services  and our revenue will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products and services 
we expect that revenues from some or all of our falcon fraud manager  decision manager for medical bill review and outsourced bill review products and services  and agreements with transunion  equifax and experian  will account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our revenue will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products and services 
factors that might affect the market acceptance of these products and services include the following changes in the business analytics industry  technological change  our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance products  saturation of market demand  loss of key customers  industry consolidation  factors that reduce the effectiveness of or need for fraud detection capabilities  and reduction of the use of credit and other payment cards as payment methods 
we will continue to depend upon major contracts with credit reporting agencies  and our future revenue could decline if the terms of these relationships change 
we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies 
these contracts  which normally have a term of five years or less  accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal if we are unable to renew any of these contracts on the same or similar terms  our revenues and results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents our revenue growth could decline if any major customer cancels  reduces or delays a purchase of our products 
most of our customers are relatively large enterprises  such as banks  insurance companies  healthcare firms  retailers and telecommunications carriers 
our future success will depend upon the timing and size of future licenses  if any  from these customers and new customers 
many of our customers and potential customers are significantly larger than we are and may have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms 
the loss of any major customer  or the delay of significant revenue from these customers  could reduce or delay our recognition of revenue 
our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services  and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services  our revenues may decline 
we will have a significant share of the available market in our scoring segment and for certain services in our strategy machine solutions segment specifically  account management services at credit card processors and in the market for credit card fraud detection software through our falcon products 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending  retail  telecommunications  personal credit management  the design of business strategies using strategy science technology and internet services 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel  and completely new to some personnel integrated as a result of the merger 
products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services  our revenues will decrease 
defects  failures and delays associated with our introduction of new products could seriously harm our business 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of products  especially in the area of customer relationship management  may affect market acceptance of our products and could harm our business  results of operations or financial position 
if we were to experience delays in commercializing and introducing new or enhanced products  if our customers were to experience significant problems with implementing and installing our products  or if our customers were dissatisfied with our products functionality or performance  our business  results of operations or financial position could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new products and product enhancements  primarily due to difficulties developing models  acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments 
errors or defects in our products that are significant  or are perceived to be significant  could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  potential product liability claims and increased service and support costs and warranty claims 
if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
in our markets  technology changes rapidly  and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware  network operating systems  programming tools  programming languages  operating systems  database technology and the use of the internet 
if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology or industry standards  our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete 
for example  the rapid growth of the internet environment creates new opportunities  risks and uncertainties for businesses  such as ours  which develop software that must also be designed to 
table of contents operate in internet  intranet and other online environments 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies  use leading third party technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise  anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs  initiate new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
new product introductions and pricing strategies by our competitors could decrease our product sales and market share  or could pressure us to reduce our product prices in a manner that reduces our margins 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and this inability could impair our capacity to sell our products 
the market for business analytics is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition in this market to persist and intensify 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope of the products and services they offer  and include in house analytics departments  credit reporting agencies  computer service providers  regional risk management  marketing  systems integration and data warehousing competitors  application software companies  including enterprise software vendors  management information system departments of our customers and potential customers  including financial institutions  insurance companies and telecommunications carriers  third party professional services and consulting organizations  internet companies  hardware suppliers that bundle or develop complementary software  network and telecommunications switch manufacturers  and service providers that seek to enhance their value added services  neural network tool suppliers  and managed care organizations 
we expect to experience additional competition from other established and emerging companies  as well as from other technologies 
for example  our falcon fraud manager and falcon fraud manager for merchants products compete against other methods of preventing credit card fraud  such as credit cards that contain the cardholder s photograph  smart cards  cardholder verification and authentication solutions and other card authorization techniques 
many of our anticipated competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  professional services and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop  promote and sell their products 
many of these companies have extensive customer relationships  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
furthermore  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition  our ability to expand our business and sell our products will be negatively affected 

table of contents our competitors may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as part of integrated suites of several related products 
this ability may cause our customers to purchase products of our competitors that directly compete with our products 
price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations  and could also harm our ability to obtain new long term contracts and renewals of existing long term contracts on favorable terms 
we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our business could be harmed 
our success will depend  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology 
because the protection of our proprietary technology is limited  our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent 
in addition  patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications  and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
any disclosure  loss  invalidity of  or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position  and ultimately  our business 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that others  including our competitors  will not use our proprietary technology without our consent 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  some of our technologies were developed under research projects conducted under agreements with various united states government agencies or subcontractors 
although we have commercial rights to these technologies  the united states government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies developed by us under these contracts  and in some cases can terminate our rights in these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis 
under these contracts with the united states government  the results of research may be made public by the government  limiting our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on our research 
we may be subject to possible infringement claims that could harm our business 
with recent developments in the law that permit patenting of business methods  we expect that products in the industry segments in which we will compete  including software products  will increasingly be subject to claims of patent infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlaps 
we will have to defend claims made against our products  and such claims may require us to incur significant defense costs or substantial damages  cease the use or sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or license a substitute non infringing technology  discontinue the use of some technology  or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available or might require substantial royalties or license fees that would reduce our margins 
security is important to our business  and breaches of security  or the perception that e commerce is not secure  could harm our business 
internet based  business to business electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
several of our products are accessed through the internet  including our 
table of contents new consumer services accessible through the www 
myfico 
com website 
consumers using the internet to access their personal information will demand the secure transmission of such data 
security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services  including our netsourced products and consumer services  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our netsourced products  consumer services and proprietary database information 
we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential product liability associated with the sale of the acquired companies products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the potential dilution of our existing stockholders and earnings per share  unanticipated liabilities  legal risks and costs  the distraction of management from our ongoing business  and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
these factors could harm our business  results of operations or financial position  particularly in the event of a significant acquisition 
if our products do not comply with government regulations that apply to us or to our customers  we could be exposed to liability or our products could become obsolete 
legislation and governmental regulation inform how our business is conducted 
both our core businesses and our newer consumer initiatives are affected by regulation 
significant regulatory areas include federal and state regulation of consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies  such as the fair credit reporting act  or fcra  regulation designed to insure that lending practices are fair and non discriminatory  such as the equal credit opportunity act  privacy law  such as provisions of the financial services modernization act of and the health insurance portability and accountability act of regulations governing the extension of credit to consumers and by regulation e under the electronic fund transfers act  as well as non governmental visa and mastercard electronic payment standards  fannie mae and freddie mac regulations  among others  for our mortgage services products  insurance regulations related to our insurance products  and consumer protection laws  such as federal and state statutes governing the use of the internet and telemarketing 

table of contents in connection with our core activities  these statutes will continue  to some degree  to directly govern our operations 
for example  the financial services modernization act restricts our use and transmittal of nonpublic personal information  grants consumers opt out rights  requires us to make disclosures to consumers about our collection and use of personal information and governs when and how we may deliver credit score explanation services to consumers 
many foreign jurisdictions relevant to our business will also regulate our operations 
for example  the european union s privacy directive creates minimum standards for the protection of personal data 
in addition  some eu member states have enacted protections which go beyond the requirements of the privacy directive 
we will be subject to the risk of possible regulatory enforcement actions if we fail to comply with any of the statutes governing our operations 
additionally  existing regulation and legislation is subject to change or more restrictive interpretation by enforcement agencies  and new restrictive legislation might pass 
for example  new legislation might restrict the sharing of information by affiliated entities  mandate providing credit scores to consumers  or narrow the permitted uses of consumer report data 
currently  the permitted uses of consumer report data in connection with customer acquisition efforts are governed primarily by the fcra  whose federal preemption provisions effectively expire in unless extended  this expiration could lead to greater state regulation  increasing the cost of customer acquisition activity 
state regulation could cause financial institutions to pursue new strategies  reducing the demand for our products 
in addition  in many states  including california  there have been periodic legislative efforts to reform workers compensation laws in order to reduce workers compensation insurance costs and to curb abuses of the workers compensation system 
simplifying state workers compensation laws  regulations or fee schedules could diminish the need for  and the benefits provided by our decision manager for medical bill review products and outsourced bill review services 
any changes to existing regulation or legislation  new regulation or legislation  or more restrictive interpretation of existing regulation could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
finally  governmental regulation influences our current and prospective clients activities  as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
for example  our clients include credit reporting agencies  credit card processors  telecommunications companies  state and federally chartered banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and other consumer lenders  all of which are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulations  and often international regulations 
moreover  industries of our future clients may also be subject to extensive regulations 
we must appropriately design products and services to function in regulated industries or risk liability to our customers for our products non compliance 
failure to obtain data from our clients to update and re develop or to create new models could harm our business 
to develop  install and support our products  including consumer credit  financial services  predictive modeling  decision analysis  intelligence management  credit card fraud control and profitability management  loan underwriting and insurance products  we will require periodic updates of our technologies and models 
we must develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our models 
in most cases  these data must be periodically updated and refreshed to enable our products to continue to work effectively in a changing environment 
we do not own or control much of the data that we require  most of which are collected privately and maintained in proprietary databases 
generally  our customers agree to provide us the data we require to analyze transactions  report results and build new models 
if we fail to maintain good relationships with our customers  or if they decline to provide such data due to legal privacy concerns or a lack of permission from their own customers  we could lose access to required data and our products might become less effective 
in addition  our decision manager for medical bill review products use data from state workers compensation fee schedules adopted by state regulatory agencies 
third parties have previously asserted copyright interests in these data 
these assertions  if successful  could prevent us from using these data 
any interruption of our supply of data could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents our operations outside the united states subject us to unique risks that may harm our results of operations 
a growing portion of our revenues is derived from international sales 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from business outside the united states 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the general economic and political conditions in countries where we sell our products and services  incongruent tax structures  difficulty in staffing our operations in various countries  the effects of a variety of foreign laws and regulations  import and export licensing requirements  longer payment cycles  potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights  currency fluctuations  changes in tariffs and other trade barriers  and difficulties and delays in translating products and related documentation into foreign languages 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term 
additionally  some of our business will be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are not currently material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to increased foreign currency transaction risks in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that our equity risks are not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than five years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 

table of contents the following table presents the principal amounts and related weighted average yields for our fixed rate investment portfolio at september  and september  september  cost carrying average cost carrying average basis amounts yield basis amounts yield in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments forward foreign currency contracts beginning october  we initiated a hedging program to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk on existing foreign currency receivable and bank balances by entering into forward contracts to sell or buy foreign currency 
at period end  foreign denominated receivables and cash balances held by our us reporting entities are remeasured into the us dollar functional currency at current market rates 
the change in value from this remeasurement is then reported as a foreign exchange gain or loss for that period and the resulting gain or loss on the forward contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated assets 
all of our forward foreign currency contracts have maturity periods of less than six months 
such derivative financial instruments are subject to market risk
