item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of our potential product  polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling as more fully described above in clinical trials  the fda in november issued a refusal to file letter with respect to our biologics license application for polyheme 
since that time  we have had numerous meetings and follow up discussions with the fda and are attempting to reach a consensus with the fda in order to move forward as quickly as possible toward regulatory approval for polyheme 
the fda regulatory process  however  is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those described above in risk factors 
the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary for us to obtain regulatory approval for polyheme  and the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme  cannot therefore be reasonably estimated at this time because of the current regulatory status of polyheme and the wide range of possible outcomes arising from our discussions with the fda 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are described in the statements of operations and in note of notes to our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses were less than fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by 
for our fiscal year  research and development expenses totaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  northfield closed all of its current clinical trials  except those relating to compassionate use 
the elimination of these expenses caused fiscal research and development expenses to be less than those incurred in fiscal for our fiscal year  research and development expenses totaled  representing an increase of  or  from the prior fiscal year 
higher manufacturing employment levels and salary increases resulted in higher labor costs  partially offset by reductions in purchased services related to reduced clinical trial field work 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  compared to expenses of  for fiscal  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease was due primarily to reduced professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  compared to expenses of  for fiscal  representing an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to increased professional fees 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will likely increase over the next few quarters as the costs of maintaining directors and officers liability insurance coverage recently increased by  and we expect to incur additional professional fees and other costs in connection with our annual shareholders meeting 
thereafter  following resolution of the regulatory status of polyheme  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our business organization to support the commercialization of polyheme 
interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal significantly lower interest rates and lower available investment balances account for the decrease 
currently available short term interest rates are yielding less than 
interest income in fiscal equaled  or a  decrease from the  in interest income reported in fiscal higher interest rates early in fiscal partially offset lower available investment balances to account for the decrease 
without additional cash inflows  interest income will decline significantly in fiscal if we maintain our present level of expenditures and earn interest at current short term money rates  interest income in fiscal is expected to decline by approximately compared to fiscal net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of  or 
per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the loss per share is primarily the result of the reduction in interest income 
fiscal operating expenses were  less than those incurred in fiscal  while interest income in fiscal was  less than the interest income earned in fiscal the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of  or 
per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the loss per share was primarily the result of higher administrative costs and professional fees  which increased over the course of the year  as well as increased labor costs 
liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the year over year increase is due primarily to funding the fiscal year end accruals for expenses related to our clinical trials partially offset by reduced purchases of property  plant  equipment and capitalized engineering services during fiscal we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating capital requirements and maintain our existing manufacturing plant and office facilities for approximately the next months 
thereafter  we will require substantial additional funding to continue our operations 
we are currently unable to fund the construction of a large scale greenfield manufacturing facility  which is estimated to cost approximately million  without raising substantial additional capital 
currently  we have manufacturing capacity of approximately  units per year 
initial engineering on the leased space adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility is completed 
this engineering indicates an additional capacity of  units per year could be developed in approximately to months at a cost of million 
we believe that a  unit facility is the smallest facility that could be commercially successful 
like a greenfield project  significant additional funding will be required before the smaller scale expansion facility could be completed 
northfield has not yet committed to the build out of a smaller scale expansion facility 
we may issue additional equity or debt securities to the public or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funding or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the outcome of our discussions with the fda regarding the regulatory status of polyheme 
general business and market conditions may also affect our ability to pursue additional sources of capital on acceptable terms 
our inability to raise sufficient levels of capital could materially delay or prevent the commercialization of polyheme  even if it is approved by the fda 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as northfield s ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual cash obligations total one year years years lease obligations     other obligations    total contractual cash obligations     the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to six months base rent and six months of additional rental payments 
if the lease were terminated today  the termination payment would be  recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
fasb statement no 
requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the enterprise also is to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
adoption of fasb statement no 
is required for fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption of this provision we expect to record an additional liability of approximately  in october  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion  and also amends arb no 
consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
fasb statement no 
retains a majority of the provisions of fasb statement no 
while establishing a single accounting model  based on the framework established in fasb statement no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
fasb statement no 
also resolves significant implementation issues related to fasb statement no 
adoption of fasb statements no 
is required for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of the provisions of fasb statement no 
to have a material impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company currently does not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of the company s short term investments  it believes that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease on an investable balance of million would decrease interest income by
