this increase was due primarily to revenue related to an increase in the number of contracts in the group plus revenue from entities acquired after the beginning of fiscal gross margin increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase was primarily due to greater revenue of the higher margin revenue services practice area

amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the non amortization of goodwill under fas effective october  the increase in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in the average balance of funds we invested  which were increased as a result of the completion in june of an equity offering resulting in million of proceeds to the company  net of offering expenses 
quarterly results set forth in item of this annual report on form k are selected income statement data for the eight quarters ended september  we derived this information from unaudited quarterly financial statements that include  in the opinion of our management  all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for such periods 
you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our revenue and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenue earned on contracts  the timing of revenue on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenue 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources year ended september  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal  cash provided by our operations was million as compared to million for fiscal cash provided by operating activities for fiscal primarily consisted of net income of million plus non cash items aggregating million and plus net cash related to working capital changes of million

during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash items of million offset by net use of cash related to working capital changes of million 
non cash items included million of depreciation and amortization and million from a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the net use of cash related to working capital changes were primarily due to an increase in billed accounts receivable of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million

at september   million remained available for future stock repurchases under the program 
our working capital at september  and was and million  respectively 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million and no debt 
management believes this strong liquidity and financial position will allow the company to continue its stock repurchase program  depending on the price of the company s common stock  and to pursue selective acquisitions 
our management believes that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our management believes that we do not have significant off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from contracts with various payment arrangements  including fixed price  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  performance based criteria  and time and materials used primarily by the consulting group 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
for fiscal year  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of our contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based and our contracts with the federal government have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 
our most significant expense is cost of revenue  which consists primarily of project related costs such as employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials contracts 
if actual costs are higher than our estimates  profitability may be adversely affected 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the client 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
also  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 
we recognize revenue on our performance based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to clients  rather than as costs are incurred 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in large  irregular increments 
additionally  costs related to certain contracts are incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
these factors may result in irregular revenue and profit margins for performance based contracts  which exist in our consulting group  health services group and human services group 
as a result  with performance based contracts we have more uncertainty regarding expected future revenue 
the human services group and health services group contracts generally contain base periods of one or more years as well as one or more option periods that may cover more than half of the potential contract duration 
as of september   our average human services group and health services group contract duration was approximately years 
our consulting group contracts had performance periods ranging from one month to approximately two years 
our average systems group contract duration was one year 
impairment of goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under the new rules  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas and fas we elected to adopt fas and effective october   and as a result  amortization of goodwill was discontinued as of the beginning of the fiscal year ended september  upon adoption  the required impairment tests were performed 
results of these impairment tests did not generate any impairment loss 
goodwill will be tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
annual impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated 
losses  if any  resulting from annual impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including statements about our confidence and strategies and our expectations about revenue  results of operations  profitability  current and future contracts  market opportunities  market demand and acceptance of our products and services 
any statements contained in this annual report on form k which are not statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements 
the words could  estimate  future  intend  may  opportunity  potential  project  will  believes  anticipates  plans  expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements because of a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors 
examples of these risks  uncertainties and other factors include reliance on government clients  risks associated with government contracting  risks involved in managing government projects  political developments and legal  economic  and other risks detailed in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial
