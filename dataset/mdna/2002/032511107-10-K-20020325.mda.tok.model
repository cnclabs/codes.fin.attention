production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand 
however  the company may decide during periods of low commodity prices to decrease development activity  which can result in decreased production volumes 
the company s average wellhead gas price in was essentially flat compared to the higher natural gas prices realized in the first half of were offset by a decrease in natural gas prices in the second half of the decrease in prices during were attributed to a severe decline in natural gas demand as a result of high prices in early  a national economic downturn and mild summer weather 
the company had less than of its forecasted natural gas wellhead sales volumes hedged as of december  as a result  future natural gas revenues are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices 
anadarko s average wellhead gas price in increased from natural gas markets improved significantly in  with the company s average realized price increasing from per mcf in to per mcf in the stronger prices were the result of lower nationwide production volumes and higher gas demand  particularly from electric power generation facilities

production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
anadarko s average realized crude oil prices for decreased compared to the decrease in crude oil prices during is attributed primarily to a modest increase in supply and very slow growth in demand due to a worldwide economic downturn and a sharp decline in jet fuel consumption 
the company had less than of its forecasted crude oil wellhead sales volumes hedged as of december  as a result  future oil and condensate revenues are subject to continued volatility based on fluctuations in market prices

marketing strategies overview the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
therefore  even though the company has several large purchasers  the company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the company s natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls at comparable market prices 
the company s marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas through anadarko energy services company aes  anadarko  anadarko canada corporation and rme 
the company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in the market prices of gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
however  the company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities 
the company s trading risk position  most of the time  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
essentially all of the company s trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months 
see derivative financial instruments under item a of this form k 
natural gas the north american natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last years and management believes continued growth to be likely 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so 
management believes the company s excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
anadarko s wholly owned marketing subsidiary aes is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing and services tailored to its customers needs 
approximately of the company s gas production was sold through aes in aes also purchases and sells third party produced gas in the company s market areas 
third party purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger  more creditworthy customers  which in turn spreads the company s relatively fixed overhead costs over more gas and can help to reduce transportation costs 
aes sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
aes has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative financial instruments 
the company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas 
rme was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported the gas marketing program within the gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke energy field services  inc duke 
most of the gpm s firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to duke in the gpm disposition 
one contract was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the gpm disposition  rme and duke signed a keep whole agreement  under which rme will pay duke if the transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke will pay rme if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at a per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy 
these sales represent and  respectively  of total revenues in and most of the company s gas production sold to duke energy is under a single agreement that expires at the end of the first quarter of volumes sold to duke under this contract may be delivered at a number of locations generally at the tailgate of processing facilities owned or operated by duke energy or its affiliates and typically in the general vicinity of the fields where produced 
the pricing of gas under this contract is market based and therefore varies monthly and by region 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is on day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
most of the company s canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from algeria is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
aes purchases and sells third party crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of leased crude oil storage facilities and various derivative financial instruments 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko also processes gas and has interests in one operated plant and three non operated plants 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
anadarko purchased pinnacle gas treating  inc  for million  in january the purchase gives anadarko ownership of a natural gas gathering system that runs through the heart of its bossier properties 
the acquisition provides the company greater flexibility in shipping and marketing its gas from the area as well as improved service to other shippers 
the network  which has a capacity of mmcf d of gas  consists of miles of large diameter pipe  miles of small diameter laterals and spurs in addition to a mile fuel redelivery system 
in  anadarko expanded the bethel plant acquired in the transaction to accommodate growing volumes in the area 
the bethel treating plant removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from gas and can handle as much as mmcf d of gas

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
the company believes its performance in both areas is excellent 
for the th consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was of total production which reached a record of mmboe 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was  of total production of mmboe 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production of mmboe 
over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged of annual production volumes 
excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement for was of total production compared to for and for excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  the company s annual worldwide reserve replacement over the past five years averaged of annual production volumes 
anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the us in  the company replaced of its us production volumes with us reserves 
this compares to a us reserve replacement of in and in the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was of production 
excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  anadarko s us reserve replacement for  and was  and  respectively  of total production 
the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was 
source us department of energy anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period was of production or of production  excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures 
industry data for are not yet available 
cost of finding cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
anadarko has historically outperformed the industry in average finding costs 
for the period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe 
the company s us finding cost for the same five year period was per boe 
excluding mergers and acquisitions  anadarko s worldwide and us finding costs for the five year period were per boe and per boe  respectively 
industry data for are not yet available 
for comparison purposes  the most recently published five year average for the industry shows worldwide finding cost was per boe and us finding cost was per boe 
source arthur andersen for the same five year period of  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe and its us finding cost was per boe 
for the five year period  the company s worldwide and us finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions were per boe and per boe  respectively 
for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in anadarko s us finding cost for was per boe 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in excluding mergers and acquisitions  anadarko s worldwide finding costs for was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in the company s us finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions for was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in finding costs in have increased due primarily to increases in oilfield services costs and increased exploration and development activity 
proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were billion boe compared to billion boe at year end and mmboe at year end reserves increased in compared to due primarily to exploration and development drilling in both the us and overseas and the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions 
anadarko s proved reserves have grown over the past three years  primarily as a result of the rme merger in  the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions in  successful exploration projects in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico  and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved gas reserves have increased since year end  reflecting the rme merger in and the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions in  continued development activity onshore in the us and other producing property acquisitions 
anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end increased to billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and mmbbls at year end crude oil reserves have risen by over the last three years primarily due to the rme merger in  the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions in and large discoveries in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end compared to at year end and at year end at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and was billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the after income taxes decrease of billion or in compared to is primarily due to significantly lower natural gas and crude oil prices at year end  partially offset by additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide and the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions 
see critical accounting policies under item and supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities unaudited in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures the company s strategy includes an active asset acquisition and divestiture program 
in  the company acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located in canada  primarily from the berkley acquisition mmboe  qatar and oman with the gulfstream acquisition mmboe and the united states mmboe 
in  anadarko acquired with the rme merger approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
excluding the rme  berkley and gulfstream acquisition transactions  during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmboe of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas  with proceeds totaling million 
reserves associated with these sales and trades were mmboe 
in  the company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas

anadarko s total capital spending for was billion  a increase compared to the increase from represents a million increase in development spending  a million increase in exploration spending and a million increase in spending for capitalized interest and other costs 
the increase in development spending was primarily related to the united states and canada as a result of the rme merger  as well as an increase in algeria s construction development spending 
the company funded its capital investment programs in  and primarily through cash flow  plus increases in long term debt  issuances of common stock and proceeds from property sales 
capital spending for has been initially set at billion  which is a decrease compared to the primary focus of the budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves and maintain company wide production at current levels 
anadarko has allocated nearly billion to worldwide development projects  primarily for fields in the gulf of mexico  western canada  east and central texas  north louisiana  the western states and algeria 
approximately million is budgeted for exploration programs  mainly in the gulf of mexico  east texas  north louisiana  alaska  western canada  congo and australia

debt at year end  anadarko s total debt was billion 
this compares to total debt of billion at year end and billion at year end as a result of the rme merger  the liabilities of rme became liabilities of the company 
the increases in debt are related primarily to the rme merger in and the berkley and gulfstream acquisitions in in march  anadarko issued million of zero yield puttable contingent debt securities zyp codes due to qualified institutional buyers under rule a and non us persons under regulation s 
the debt securities were priced with a zero coupon  zero yield to maturity and a conversion premium of 
the proceeds from the debt securities were used initially to finance costs associated with the acquisition of berkley 
holders of the zyp codes have the right to require anadarko to purchase all or a portion of their zyp codes in march    or  at  per zyp codes

synthetic leases in november  anadarko entered into a build to suit lease arrangement for its corporate office building in the woodlands  texas 
the development and acquisition of the property was financed by a special purpose entity spe sponsored by a financial institution 
the lease balance to be funded under this arrangement will not exceed million 
the spe is not consolidated in the company s financial statements and  based on the initial terms of the agreement  the company has accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the initial lease term is five years  with up to seven one year renewal options 
monthly lease payments are based on the london interbank borrowing rate applied against the lease balance and are expected to begin in future minimum lease payments under this lease are included in the table above 
the lease contains various covenants including covenants regarding the company s financial condition 
default under the lease  including violation of these covenants  could require the company to purchase the facility for a specified amount  which approximates the lessor s original cost million funded as of december  
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
at the end of the lease term  the company has an option to either purchase the facility for the purchase option amount of the lease balance plus any outstanding lease payments or to assist the spe in the sale of the property 
the company has provided a residual value guarantee for any deficiency if the property is sold for less than the sale option amount million at december  
in addition  the company is entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the purchase option amount 
in december  the company entered into a lease arrangement for an office building in the woodlands  texas

the company has provided a residual value guarantee for any deficiency if the property is sold for less than the sale option amount million at december  
in addition  the company is entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the property in excess of the purchase option amount 
if  for either of these leases  the company determines that it is probable that the expected fair value of the property at the end of the lease term will be less than the purchase option amount  the company will accrue the expected loss on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term 
currently  management does not believe it is probable that the fair market value of either of these properties will be less than the purchase option amount at the end of the lease term 
oil and gas activities as is common in the oil and gas industry  anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
the amounts in the table reflect obligations and commitments that are not included in the capital budget 
following is a description of the company s significant operating obligations and commitments related to oil and gas activities 
production platform in december  the company signed a letter of intent with el paso energy partners epn under which a floating production platform for its marco polo discovery in green canyon block of the gulf of mexico will be installed 
epn will construct the platform and processing facilities that upon completion  expected in  will be operated by anadarko 
the proposed agreement provides that anadarko will dedicate its production from green canyon block and other green canyon blocks to the processing facilities 
the proposed agreement will require a monthly demand charge of slightly over million for five years beginning at the time of project completion and a processing fee based upon production 
anadarko will be entitled to of the net after tax cash proceeds from these facilities after payout  as defined  is attained 
the letter of intent does not contain any purchase options  purchase obligations or value guarantees 
the previous table does not include any amounts related to this letter of intent 
drilling and work commitments anadarko has various work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments 
the above table includes drilling and work related commitments of million  comprised of million in the united states  million in algeria  million in canada and million in other international locations 
the commitments in algeria are related primarily to exploration and development contracts with sonatrach  who is the beneficial owner of of the company s outstanding common stock 
sales commitments in canada  the company has commitments to deliver gas and oil under fixed price contracts 
the gas and oil volumes to be delivered under these contracts are as follows commitments by period later year years years years total natural gas volume million mmbtu price per mmbtu crude oil volume million barrels price is nymex west texas intermediate minus per barrel with a floor of per barrel and a ceiling of per barrel for heavy oil delivered at hardisty terminal 
guarantees anadarko is guarantor for certain obligations of its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries  which are included in the consolidated financial statements and notes under item of this form k 
in conjunction with the rme merger  the company guaranteed all of the outstanding debt of rme and its subsidiaries  which is included in the consolidated debt of the company 
in addition  the company is guarantor for specific financial obligations of two trona mining affiliates 
the investments in these entities  which are not consolidated subsidiaries  are accounted for using the equity method 
the company has guaranteed a portion of certain industrial revenue bonds  amounts due under a revolving credit agreement and letters of credit required for environmental surety bonds 
the amount the company would be obligated to pay should the affiliates default on these obligations would be up to million for environmental surety bonds and million in and million after for debt 
enron the recent financial problems of enron have had no material adverse effect on the company 
as of december   in connection with several physical and financial contracts  the company had million  net  in accounts payable to enron north america and million in accounts receivable from other enron affiliates 
all contracts have been terminated by anadarko under the terms of the agreements  and million has been charged to expense in the company  through purchase accounting entries for the berkley acquisition  had recorded market value liabilities on four contracts with enron which were being amortized over the terms of the contract

outlook on liquidity anadarko s net cash from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and million in commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil rose dramatically in and decreased significantly in the second half of the company s original capital expenditure budget for has been set at billion 
cash flow from operations will vary depending upon  among other things  actual commodity prices received throughout the year 
the company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations 
however  due to activities in progress at the beginning of and the seasonal nature of drilling activity in alaska and canada  the company expects that a disproportionate amount of the capital expenditure budget will be spent in the first and second quarters of the year 
as a result  it is likely that there will be an increase in debt early in the year 
failure of prices to increase later in the year  as expected  could result in increased borrowing throughout the year 
reduced fourth quarter activity in relative to could lead to higher working capital requirements and also result in additional borrowing 
the company has a three year stock buyback program to purchase up to billion in shares of anadarko common stock 
anticipated stock repurchases for are not included in the announced capital expenditure budget and could require additional borrowing 
anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for the company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows  supplemented as needed by short term borrowings of commercial paper  money market loans or credit facility borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place million in committed credit facilities  which are supplemented by various non committed credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may file shelf registrations in advance with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowing  to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
at this time  anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  through the exercise of stock options or through the company s employee savings plan and employee stock ownership plan equity funded contributions 
see regulatory matters and additional factors affecting business for additional information 
the company s credit agreements allow for a maximum capitalization ratio of debt  exclusive of the effect of any non cash write downs 
as of december   anadarko s capitalization ratio was debt 
while there is no specific restriction on paying dividends  under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at december  the amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
dividends in october  the board of directors of anadarko increased the quarterly dividend on the company s common stock from cents to cents per share 
in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in fourth quarter 
in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share per quarter 
the dividend amount in was million cents per share per quarter 
anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in in  and  the company also paid million  million and million  respectively  in preferred stock dividends 
in  the preferred stock dividends are expected to be million 
critical accounting policies financial statements and use of estimates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of anadarko and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
the company accounts for investments in affiliated companies to owned using the equity method of accounting 
the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances 
in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs for unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and abandonment costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments is amortized using the unit of production method 
all other properties are depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets  which ranges from three to years 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserves are considered proved if they can be produced economically as demonstrated by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to uneconomic conditions 
costs excluded oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
any impairment is transferred to the costs to be amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results or relinquishing drilling rights 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
significant properties  comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks  alaska  the land grant and other international areas  are individually evaluated each quarter by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
non producing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
the land grant has been in active evaluation to determine an exploration program for this acreage 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
all other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period  depending on the lease term 
insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the united states and canada 
non producing leases are impaired over a three to five year period based on the average lease period 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion 
capitalized interest sfas no 
 capitalization of interest costs  provides standards for the capitalization of interest costs as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets 
fasb interpretation fin no 
provides guidance for the application of sfas no 
to the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under fin no 
 costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects  on which dd a expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress  qualify for capitalization of interest 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the company s weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of costs excluded 
capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense 
as costs excluded are transferred to the dd a pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the dd a pool 
ceiling test companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give anadarko a significant loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced 
shown below is a summary of the ceiling test calculation and description of the major components 
ceiling test calculation present value of oil and gas properties pv costs excluded income taxes ceiling net oil and gas properties and equipment deferred income tax liability net investment ceiling net investment cushion write off after income taxes present value of oil and gas properties pv estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves of gas  oil  condensate and ngls are made in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities 
the present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted using a prescribed discount rate 
proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls that can be produced economically as demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests 
these estimates  which are determined by the company s engineers  are reviewed and revised as reservoir performance  prices and other economic conditions change 
future net revenues are calculated based on estimated production volumes generally using the oil and gas prices in effect on the last day of the quarter  held flat for the life of the reserves 
future net revenues are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on quarter end cost levels  assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  the oil and gas prices on the last day of the quarter significantly impact the calculation of the pv at year end  anadarko s ceiling tests were based on nymex prices of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for crude oil 
the nymex prices are adjusted by location and quality differentials  as appropriate  to determine anadarko s realized prices 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
costs excluded costs excluded are capitalized costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
these costs are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized through dd a expense 
anadarko excludes all costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
when proved reserves are found  the decrease in costs excluded is offset by an increase in pv  thereby generally increasing the ceiling 
when proved reserves are not found  the decrease in costs excluded is not offset by an increase in pv  thereby decreasing the ceiling 
income taxes future income taxes are based on the existing tax rates applied to the difference between the total of the present value of the future net cash flows plus costs excluded less the tax basis of the oil and gas properties 
the effect of tax loss carryforwards and credits is considered in determining income taxes 
net oil and gas properties and equipment net oil and gas properties and equipment are the capitalized costs related to oil and gas activities less the accumulated dd a 
under the full cost method of accounting the costs for unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
the net capitalized costs are depreciated using the unit of production method 
net properties and equipment increase due to capital expenditures or acquisitions and decrease due to dd a expense  property divestitures or ceiling test impairments 
deferred income tax liability deferred income taxes related only to oil and gas properties are included in the deferred income tax liability 
derivative financial instruments anadarko uses derivative financial instruments for various purposes and carefully monitors the credit worthiness of each counter party 
effective january  derivative financial instruments utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to the company s equity production were accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
under this statement  all derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
realized gains losses and option premiums are recognized in the statement of income when the underlying physical gas and oil production is sold 
accordingly  realized derivative gains losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the underlying physical gas and oil production 
realized derivative gains losses are reflected in the average sales price of the physical gas and oil production 
accounting for unrealized gains losses is dependent on whether the derivative financial instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship 
derivative financial instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values  cash flows or foreign currencies  if certain conditions are met 
if the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value  the gains losses on the derivative financial instrument  as well as the offsetting losses gains on the hedged item  are recognized currently in earnings 
consequently  if gains losses on the derivative financial instrument and the related hedge item do not completely offset  the difference ie  ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized currently in earnings 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivative financial instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gains losses from the derivative financial instrument  if any  as well as any amounts excluded from the assessment of the cash flow hedges effectiveness are recognized currently in other income expense 
effective july  the company implemented derivatives implementation group issue g  cash flow hedges assessing and measuring the effectiveness of a purchased option used in a cash flow hedge  which provides guidance for assessing the effectiveness on total changes in an option s cash flows rather than only on changes in the option s intrinsic value 
time value changes were previously being recognized in current earnings since the company excluded time value changes from its assessment of hedge effectiveness 
if the hedged exposure is a foreign currency exposure  the accounting is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
unrealized gains losses on derivative financial instruments that do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
derivative financial instruments  as well as physical delivery purchase and sale contracts  utilized in the company s energy trading activities and in the management of price risk associated with the company s firm transportation keep whole commitment see derivative financial instruments under item a of this form k are accounted for under the mark to market accounting method pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
under this method  the derivatives and physical delivery contracts are revalued in each accounting period and premiums and unrealized gains losses are recorded in the statement of income and carried as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company s derivative financial instruments associated with the marketing and trading activities are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option valuations are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at a per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points  etc 
that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
new accounting principles sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires discontinuing amortization of goodwill after year end and requires that goodwill be tested for impairment 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to business levels referred to as reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value including goodwill then a second test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment 
if the second test is necessary  the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this difference represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount of the impairment 
the goodwill impairment test is performed annually  and also at interim dates upon the occurrence of significant events 
significant events include a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold  significant adverse trends in current and future oil and gas prices  nationalization of any of the company s oil and gas properties  or  significant increases in a reporting unit s carrying value relative to its fair value 
the initial goodwill impairment test is required to be performed using an effective date of january  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
anadarko does not expect any initial goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting of asset retirement obligations  requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and will be effective for the company in january the company is evaluating the impact of sfas no 
sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the adoption of sfas no 
as of january had no impact on the company s financial statements 
for additional information on the company s accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
regulatory matters and additional factors affecting business the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management 
anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
under the full cost method of accounting  a non cash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low 
whether the company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter  as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter 
while this non cash charge can give anadarko a significant reported loss for the period  future expenses for dd a will be reduced 
environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
legal proceedings general the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  royalty claims  contract claims and environmental claims 
the company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims  including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos and benzene while working at a refinery in corpus christi  texas  which the company sold in segments in and while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved
