deloitte consulting serves as a subcontractor on nic s business filings contract with the california secretary of state  as further discussed below 
in march  we completed a million cash investment in privately held e filing 
com  inc  a provider of online filing applications for legal services  giving us ownership of of e filing 
com 
this strategic investment is expected to enable both e filing 
com and nic to expand access to judicial egovernment applications nationwide 
the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
also in march  we completed a million cash investment in privately held tidemark computer systems  inc  a provider of egovernment permit applications and related services for local government  giving us ownership of approximately of tidemark 
this strategic investment was expected to allow tidemark and nic to help communities automate a variety of business processes through mobile and web based applications 
at december   we were closely monitoring our investment in tidemark due to significant liquidity issues inasmuch as tidemark s current liquid resources were sufficient to meet operating requirements only through the end of april at the end of  tidemark was in various stages of merger and acquisition discussions with several companies 
we expected tidemark would be successful in merging its operations with or being acquired by another company 
based on information received in the latter half of march from a company looking to acquire tidemark  we determined that we would not be able to recover the entire carrying value of our investment 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of our investment to its estimated fair value resulting in a noncash impairment loss of approximately million 
in may  a private technology company acquired tidemark for cash consideration of approximately million 
we received approximately million in cash from the transaction and had no investment balance remaining at december  in october  we completed an initial  cash investment in e government solutions limited  or egs  a private joint venture among swiss venture capital firm etf group  london based venture development organization vesta group  and our european subsidiary  nic european business ltd

business filings contract with california secretary of state on september   our electronic corporate filings business was awarded a five year contract by the california secretary of state 
the five year contract to build an information management and retrieval system for the business programs division of the california secretary of state is valued at approximately million and is the largest government contract we have ever been awarded 
this award is both the nation s largest state egovernment filing initiative on record and the most comprehensive secretary of state outsourced filing system project in the united states 
the new web enabled document management and filing system will increase efficiency and reduce expenses for the state by eliminating paperwork and decreasing processing and turnaround times 
upon completion  the new system will allow agency customers  primarily from the banking and legal communities  to search  retrieve  and submit documents online 
customers will also be able to pay fees for a variety of transactions  including new incorporation document filings  trademark registrations  and uniform commercial code filings 
the contract includes comprehensive back office document and revenue management systems  web and internet applications that will take approximately of the agency s business programs division s services online  and imaging and indexing of more than ten million historical document pages 
as part of the contract  we will provide three years of onsite support and maintenance for the system as well as marketing consultation to drive user adoption within the legal and banking industries 
we will account for revenues under this contract on the percentage of completion basis 
work on this contract commenced in september  and we believe this contract will be profitable 
in conjunction with this contract  in march  we issued a letter of credit in the amount of million as collateral for a performance bond required by the contract 
the letter of credit has been fully collateralized by our cash and marketable securities 
overview of business models we classify our revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software and services 
the portal category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our subsidiaries operating state and local government portals on an outsourced basis 
the software and services category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our eprocurement  electronic corporate filings  ethics elections  commercial vehicle compliance and aol businesses 
we currently derive revenue from five main sources o transaction based fees  o fees for managing electronic government operations  o software licensing and maintenance fees  o fees for application development and hosting  and o advertising fees from aol 
each of these revenue types and the corresponding business models are further described below 
our portal outsourcing businesses in most of our outsourced portal businesses  our revenues are generated from transactions  which generally include the collection of transaction based and subscription fees 
the highest volume  most commercially valuable service we offer is access to motor vehicle records  referred to as dmv records  through our insurance industry records exchange network 
this service accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in  in and in we believe that while this application will continue to be an important source of revenue  its contribution as a percentage of our total revenues will decline as other sources grow 
choicepoint  which resells these records to the auto insurance industry  accounted for approximately of revenues in  in and in choicepoint is our only customer to account for more than of our consolidated revenues for the past three years 
in  portal revenues accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
in our outsourced portal businesses for  dmv revenues represented approximately of portal revenues and non dmv revenues represented 
for a mature portal a portal operating for more than one year  annual dmv revenue growth has averaged approximately to for the past three years  whereas non dmv revenue growth is currently averaging approximately per year 
transaction based revenues from our outsourced state portal business units are highly correlated to population  but are also affected by pricing policies established by government entities for public records  the number and growth of commercial enterprises and the government entity s development of policy and information technology infrastructure supporting electronic government 
we charge for access to records on a per record basis and  depending upon government policies  also on a fixed or sliding scale bulk basis 
our fees are set by negotiation with the government agencies that control the records and are typically approved by a government sanctioned oversight body 
we recognize revenues from transactions primarily information access fees and filing fees on an accrual basis net of the transaction fee due to the government  and we bill end user customers primarily on a monthly basis 
we typically receive a majority of payments via electronic funds transfer and credit card within days of billing and remit payment to governments within days of the transaction 
the costs that we pay state agencies for data access are accrued as accounts receivable and accounts payable at the time revenue from the access of public information is recognized 
we must remit a certain amount or percentage of these fees to government agencies regardless of whether we ultimately collect the fees 
the pricing of transactions varies by the type of transaction and by state 
currently  under our contracts with the states of iowa  oklahoma and new hampshire  kent and washtenaw counties mi and the florida association of court clerks  we provide consulting  development and management services for these government portals predominantly under a fixed price model 
however  under our contracts with oklahoma  kent county and florida  we anticipate transaction based revenues beginning in our software and services businesses eprocurement our eprocurement business  while traditionally deriving software licensing and maintenance revenues from several federal agencies  also has contracted to provide eprocurement services under a transaction based pricing model  a trend that began in the third quarter of when our eprocurement business modified its business model from a software licensing and maintenance fee basis to a transaction basis 
nic commerce has contracted to provide electronic procurement services under transaction based pricing models to four state local government agencies houston galveston area council of governments h gac  the state of south carolina and the states of colorado and utah 
however  at the end of  we determined it was unlikely that nic commerce s colorado utah project would continue beyond the pilot phase of production  which concluded in february as our procurement portals in south carolina and houston galveston ramp up business in  we expect an increase in transaction based revenues from nic commerce 
however  we anticipate decreased year over year quarterly eprocurment revenues in as a result of the planned downsizing of this business as further discussed below 
in  our eprocurement business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
electronic corporate filings our electronic corporate filings business derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues from long term application development contracts on the percentage of completion method 
the average size contract for this business has historically been approximately million to million 
however  as further discussed below  our five year contract with the california secretary of state is valued at approximately million 
in  our electronic corporate filings business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
ethics elections our ethics elections business derives the majority of its revenues from time and materials application development and maintenance outsourcing contracts and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
in  our ethics elections business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
commercial vehicle compliance our commercial vehicle compliance business currently derives the majority of its revenues from cost plus time and materials application development contracts with governments and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
in  our commercial vehicle compliance business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
aol in august  we entered into a three year agreement with america online  inc to deliver government information  services and applications through aol s government guide 
nic and aol share revenues generated from the license or sale of advertisement on or through the government guide 
we recognize our share of aol s advertising revenues when notified of the amount due from aol  which is approximately one month after the advertisement is provided 
in  our aol business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently issued by the sec  requests companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
note that the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our electronic corporate filings business  nic conquest  derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs for each contract 
revenues and profits from these contracts are based on the company s estimates to complete and are reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
in  management determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under existing contractual obligations was not expected to cover anticipated costs of developing and implementing the related applications and accrued approximately million for the expected loss 
due to developments arising in late march relating to subcontractor performance and technical delivery issues  management determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under an application development contract with the indiana secretary of state was not expected to cover the company s current estimate of costs to develop and implement the related application and accrued approximately million for the expected loss 
due to developments arising in the second half of relating to nic conquest s decision to migrate to a common operating platform for its ucc and corporations filing applications  management accrued an additional million for expected losses on outstanding contracts where migration was elected 
these losses are included in cost of software and services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the accrual for all application development contracts held by the company was approximately million  which management believes is adequate 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating the costs of completion  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term 
impairment of intangible assets at each balance sheet date  and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant  management assesses the carrying value of recorded goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment based primarily on the ability to recover the balances from expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis were to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
there is considerable management judgment necessary to determine future cash flows  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  relating to our nic commerce  nic technologies and nic conquest businesses as further discussed below and in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements  eliminates amortization of goodwill  and requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning january  at december   the carrying value of our goodwill  relating exclusively to the acquisition of idt in october  was approximately million 
in  we recognized goodwill amortization expense of approximately million per quarter relating to the idt acquisition that will no longer be recognized upon adoption of sfas no 
we have not completed an assessment of the impact of the impairment testing required by sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the company to determine if the fair value of idt is less than the carrying value at january  by june  if the fair value were less than the carrying value  goodwill would likely be impaired 
idt was profitable in and is expected to be profitable in however  we have contingent purchase price obligations related to idt see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  and issuance of additional consideration in or could result in impairment even if our recorded goodwill at january  was not impaired under sfas no 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have a recent history of unprofitable operations primarily due to operating losses incurred in the companies we have acquired since september these losses have generated significant federal tax net operating losses  or nols 
we had available at december   and nol carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million  million and million that will expire in the years  and  respectively 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from future operations to fully utilize the nol carryforwards prior to expiration 
the recorded amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
there is considerable management judgment necessary to determine future taxable income  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
for additional discussion of deferred income taxes  see the deferred tax assets section below and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
impairment and restructuring charges in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  relating to our nic commerce  nic technologies and nic conquest businesses 
in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively  relating to our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses 
nic commerce during the third quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of efed 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent restructurings in this business  which included workforce layoffs and office closings  significant underperformance of this business relative to historical and projected future operating results  management s reallocation of capital resources from this underperforming business to its most profitable businesses  and significant negative industry and economic trends within the eprocurement sector 
in addition to the management and organizational changes that have taken place at nic commerce since third quarter of  we continued the restructuring of this business in recent months by eliminating the majority of its marketing and business development staff due to poor performance  with additional headcount reductions made in october we concluded the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of efed no longer had value and recognized a million impairment loss in the third quarter of furthermore  in december  we determined it was unlikely that nic commerce s colorado utah project would continue beyond the pilot phase of production 
this  among other factors  led us to determine that the nic commerce business would be downsized further in  which will include the terminations of certain senior administrative staff and development staff to more appropriately size operations to visible demand 
such demand could not support the recoverability of costs nic commerce had capitalized on the latest versions of its eprocurement software and million was expensed as an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of nic technologies during the third quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of sdr technologies 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent restructuring in this business  which included workforce layoffs and office closings  and the significant underperformance of this business 
nic technologies had been integrated as the application development organization for our portal businesses 
however  a series of organizational restructurings completed in the third quarter of lead to significant layoffs at nic technologies and a shift in application development from what were previously centralized development operations in westlake village  california and pune  india to regionalized operations in selected state portals 
in total  less than employees who were employees of the original sdr technologies were employed with nic at december   down from a previous high of approximately employees at the date of acquisition in may additionally  we determined that the value of the technology intangible relating to the sdr acquisition was impaired 
we significantly curtailed funding of all research and development stage technology projects that did not have demonstrable and immediate positive financial returns for the company 
specifically  future funding to actively develop and market the company s web ivr technology was significantly scaled back 
this web ivr technology was the primary value driver of the product technology intangible resulting from the sdr acquisition 
goodwill related to the sdr acquisition primarily represented the benefits we expected to receive from a centralized application development organization 
as we have now abandoned that strategy and eliminated most of the development resources acquired with sdr  management concluded the goodwill no longer had value 
we recognized a million impairment loss in the third quarter of representing the unamortized balances of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of sdr 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of we continued to evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software at nic technologies 
we determined that the expected future cash flows of nic technologies would not be sufficient to recover the capitalized software assets and million was expensed as an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of nic conquest due to developments arising in the second half of relating to nic conquest s decision to migrate to a common operating platform for its core ucc and corporations filing applications  we determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under certain application development contractual obligations was not expected to cover anticipated costs of developing and implementing the related applications and accrued losses of approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to devote all resources to completing existing contracts and not actively market the solution to new customers in the foreseeable future 
based on this decision not to actively market the solution  we determined that the carrying value of capitalized software development costs relating to this business were not recoverable and had been impaired 
this assessment resulted in an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
as a result of the decision to curtail marketing and the uncertainty regarding future sales of this solution  we concluded that the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill related to nic conquest was impaired and recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of restructurings in september  we announced that our third quarter operating results would likely fall short of the consensus analyst revenue and earnings estimates 
concurrent with this announcement  we announced the restructuring of our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses  the reorganization of our management team and the consolidation of our marketing efforts 
our lower than expected third quarter operating results were mainly attributable to our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses  which were affected by industry wide post yk delays in government decision making and sales cycles during the first half of these businesses were the main sources of revenue shortfall versus expectations as a result of their management s ineffective forecasting and inadequate response to market signals that new business and revenues would be less than expectations 
in addition  these businesses were the main source of ebitda shortfall versus expectations as a result of expenditures for sustained development  marketing and product delivery efforts to support these operations whose revenue and gross profit impact did not materialize as expected during the quarter 
our response to the inadequate performance of these businesses  both of which we have acquired since september  was to initiate a change in leadership  while simultaneously adjusting operational processes and resources to more appropriately size these operations to visible demand and more efficiently align them with other egovernment initiatives across nic 
the restructuring involved employee reductions in our marketing division and at our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses 
as a result  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  in the third quarter of relating to employee severance costs 
employee severance costs paid through december  totaled  with  paid in cash requirements for the restructuring were funded from available resources 
employee severance costs related to severance packages for employees in marketing  product development and administration  of which were terminated by december   with two additional terminations made in in addition to the management and organizational changes that have taken place at nic commerce since the third quarter of as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  we continued to evaluate the viability of our eprocurement business 
we determined it was unlikely that nic commerce s colorado utah project would continue beyond the pilot phase of production 
this  among other factors  led the company to determine that the nic commerce business would need to be downsized further in as a result  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of relating primarily to employee severance and lease abandonment costs 
at december    remained accrued for future payments 
cash requirements for the restructuring will be funded from available resources 
employee severance costs totaling approximately  relate to severance packages for nine employees in administration and development  with all terminations expected to take place by the end of the first quarter of the pre tax savings from these reductions are expected to approximate million annually 
presentation of revenues and reclassified consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize revenues for the access of public information net of the transaction fee due to the government 
previously  the company presented such revenues on a gross basis and accrued the costs that it pays to government agencies for data access as cost of revenues 
all prior period information was reclassified for comparative purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to reclassify certain information in our consolidated statements of operations 
consistent with prior reporting periods  we have continued to classify revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software and services 
however  as compared to prior reporting periods  no total gross profit line is reported  as we believe the total gross profit line is not a meaningful presentation 
instead  cost of portal revenues and cost of software and services revenues have been classified as separate operating expense categories 
the portal category includes revenues primarily from the company s subsidiaries operating enterprise wide state and local government portals under long term contracts on an outsourced basis 
the software and services category includes revenues primarily from the company s eprocurement  electronic corporate filings  ethics elections  commercial vehicle compliance and aol businesses 
the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of portal revenues  cost of software and services revenues  general and administrative  and sales and marketing 
cost of portal revenues consist of all direct costs associated with operating outsourced portals including employee compensation  telecommunications  maintenance and all other costs associated with the provision of dedicated client service such as dedicated facilities for our outsourced contracts 
cost of software and services revenues consist of all direct project costs to provide software development and services such as employee compensation  the cost of subcontractors hired as part of software and services projects  and all other direct project costs including materials  travel and other out of pocket expenses 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of corporate level expenses relating to human resource management  administration  legal and finance  and all costs of non customer service personnel from our software and services businesses  including information systems  office rent and maintenance 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of corporate level expenses relating to market development  public relations and promotional activities including advertising  image development and market research 
all prior period information was reclassified for comparative purposes 
comparison of years ended december   and in this section  we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
key financial metrics revenue growth gross profit outsourced portals gross profit software and services general and administrative as of revenue sales and marketing as of revenue revenues 
total revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
portal revenues were million for  a increase over the prior year 
of this increase  was attributable to revenues from our outsourced state portal business units that became operational after december   including our portals in idaho and tennessee  which began to generate substantive revenues in the first quarter of  our hawaii and montana portals  which began to generate driver s license record access  or dmv  revenues in the third quarter of  and from our contracts with the state of oklahoma and the florida association of court clerks 
our oklahoma and florida contracts are different from our traditional self funding outsourced portal contracts  as we receive fixed payments for the development of these portals with the expectations of future application development and transaction revenues 
we are in the development phase of our contract with the florida association of court clerks and are recognizing revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
approximately of the increase in portal revenues for was attributable to an increase in same state portal volumes states open more than two years and was attributable to our local portals 
excluding outsourced portal business units that became operational after december  and our state portals that operate under fixed price models  same state portal transaction revenues for increased over the prior year as a result of increased transaction volumes mainly from our kansas  indiana  virginia and utah subsidiaries 
software and services revenues were million for  a increase over the prior year 
of this increase  was from idt  our commercial vehicle compliance business  which we acquired in october  was from our aol business  which began to generate substantive advertising revenues subsequent to the launch of aol s government guide in march  and was from nic conquest  our electronic corporate filings business  which benefited from its five year  million contract with the california secretary of state to develop and implement a comprehensive information management and filing system 
this contract commenced in september  and we recognized approximately million in revenues during under percentage of completion accounting 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues from our eprocurement business  and to a lesser extent  our ethics elections business 
eprocurement revenues decreased in due to an anticipated fall off in license and maintenance revenues  a trend that began in the third quarter of when we modified our eprocurement business model 
as procurement portals in south carolina and houston galveston become more fully operational in  we expect an increase in transaction based eprocurement revenue in however  we anticipate decreased year over year quarterly eprocurment revenues in as a result of the planned downsizing of this business as further discussed above 
total revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
portal revenues were million for  a increase over the prior year 
of this increase  was attributable to revenues from our outsourced state portal business units that became operational after june  and was from an increase in revenues relating to same state portal volumes 
excluding state portal business units that became operational after june  and our state portals that operate under fixed price models  same state portal transaction revenues for increased over the prior year as a result of increased transaction volumes mainly from our kansas  indiana and virginia subsidiaries 
software and services revenues were million for  a increase over the prior year  primarily reflecting incremental revenues from businesses we have acquired since september of this increase  was attributable to nic conquest  which was formed in january through the merger of our application services division and conquest softworks  llc  was from nic commerce  which we acquired in september  was from nic technologies  which we acquired in may  and was from idt  which we acquired in october cost of portal revenues 
cost of portal revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
of this increase  was attributable to costs from our outsourced state portal business units that became operational after december   was attributable to our local portals  the majority of which became operational in  and was attributable to an increase in same state cost of portal revenues 
excluding outsourced state portal business units that became operational after december   same state cost of portal revenues increased over the prior year primarily as a result of ongoing technology enhancements and service delivery investment in our state portal partnerships 
however  our portal gross profit rate increased to in compared to for this increase was primarily attributable to our tennessee  idaho and hawaii portals  which began to generate substantive revenues in  yet were in the early stages of development throughout most of and had not yet begun to generate revenues at december  our same state portal gross profit rate increased to in compared to in and  primarily as a result of increased business and citizen adoption of existing portal applications and the addition of new revenue generating applications and services within existing portals in we intend to continue to expand our portal operations by developing and promoting new applications and services within our existing portals 
accordingly  we expect our same state gross profit rate to continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
cost of portal revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
of this increase  was attributable to costs from our outsourced state and local portal business units that became operational after june   and was from an increase in same state cost of portal revenues 
excluding outsourced portal business units that became operational after june   same state cost of portal revenues increased over the prior year primarily as a result of ongoing technology enhancements and service delivery investment in our state portal partnerships 
our portal gross profit rate decreased to in from in due to our tennessee  idaho and hawaii portals  which were in the early stages of development throughout most of and had not yet begun to generate revenues at december  cost of software and services revenues 
cost of software and services revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  cost of software and services revenues for  and include charges of million  million and million  respectively  for anticipated costs in excess of revenues to be recognized under certain of our application services contracts in our electronic corporate filings business 
excluding these charges  cost of software and services revenues increased by in  which was relatively consistent with the increase in software and services revenues in the current year 
of this increase  was attributable to our nic conquest business  was attributable to idt  and was attributable to our aol business  which commenced operations in the third quarter of partially offsetting these increases were decreases from our eprocurment and ethics elections businesses as a result of decreased revenues in cost of software and services revenues increased to million in as compared to the prior year 
excluding the charges noted above pertaining to our electronic corporate filings business  cost of software and services revenues were million in  a increase over the prior year  primarily reflecting incremental costs from businesses we have acquired since september of this increase  was attributable to nic conquest  was from nic commerce  was from nic technologies  was from aol and was from idt 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in were million  a decrease from the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of approximately million for employee severance and lease abandonment costs related to the restructuring of our nic commerce business  as further discussed above 
in the second quarter of  the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million relating to our withdrawn secondary stock offering as further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
during the third quarter of  the company incurred a charge of approximately million for employee severance costs related to the corporate restructuring of our nic commerce and nic technologies divisions and the consolidation of our marketing efforts  as further discussed above 
the company also incurred a one time non cash charge of approximately million in the third quarter of due to the adoption of a company wide vacation policy that required the company to recognize a liability for earned but unused employee vacation 
excluding these charges  general and administrative expenses for increased over we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease significantly in as a result of our continuing overhead cost containment and efficiency efforts throughout the company and the organizational restructurings and headcount reductions that have taken place within our acquired businesses since the third quarter of general and administrative expenses in were million  a increase over the prior year 
excluding the charges incurred in as discussed above  general and administrative expenses for increased over  primarily reflecting incremental corporate level expenses and costs from businesses we have acquired since september of this increase  was from nic commerce  was from nic technologies  was from nic conquest and was from idt 
additionally  of the increase was from an increase in corporate level expenses as a result of becoming a public company in july  and our overall growth and positioning for future growth  including strategic infrastructure investments in finance  technology and management personnel 
excluding the charges discussed above  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
the pronounced increase in was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate level expenses since becoming a public company in july and costs from businesses we have acquired since september as further discussed above 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease to between and in we expect to accomplish this by keeping corporate level expenses relatively flat year over year and by leveraging the relatively fixed cost structure within our outsourced portal businesses through the continued expansion of existing and new portal applications and services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  a decrease from million in sales and marketing expenses were million in the increase in corporate level expenses in was primarily attributable to expenditures for marketing and public relations personnel and promotional activities including advertising  image development and market research subsequent to becoming a public company in july in  we significantly curtailed public relations  brand image and advertising expenses and consolidated our sales and marketing efforts into one corporate level market development department to more appropriately match expenditures to expected market demand for our egovernment services 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were approximately  and for  and  respectively 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to remain between and throughout impairment loss 
for additional information on the impairment losses we recorded in  refer to the discussion above under impairment and restructuring charges and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
stock compensation 
stock compensation for and consisted primarily of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to common stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees in and stock compensation was million for  which consisted of compensation expense recognized on stock sales to senior level executives in the first half of and on stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees in late and from february through may  we sold approximately  shares of common stock to key employees and recognized approximately million in compensation expense for the amount by which the fair value of common stock sold exceeded the amount paid 
in addition  we recognized approximately million in compensation expense in relating to stock options 
we expect to recognize approximately million in deferred compensation in  with the remaining million to be recognized by the end of the second quarter of depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for as compared to was primarily due to intangible asset amortization resulting from our four acquisitions since september and the amortization of the fair value of fully vested warrants issued to aol in august depreciation expense increased by million for the year ended december  as a result of additions to property and equipment throughout and the depreciation of fixed assets from our acquired businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in intangible asset amortization resulting from our march  exchange offer 
certain intangible assets relating to that exchange offer became fully amortized in december   june  and august  we wrote off all remaining goodwill and purchase accounting intangible assets relating to our business combinations with sdr technologies  efed and conquest in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  we wrote off capitalized software development costs from our nic technologies  nic commerce and nic conquest businesses in the fourth quarter of at december   the carrying value of the company s remaining goodwill  relating exclusively to our acquisition of idt in october  was approximately million 
in  the company recognized goodwill amortization expense of approximately million per quarter relating to the idt acquisition that will no longer be recognized upon adoption of sfas no 
on january  accordingly  we expect amortization expense to decrease significantly in to approximately million  the majority of which will consist of the amortization of the fair value of the fully vested warrants we issued to aol in august  as further discussed in note to the note to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
total depreciation and amortization expense in is expected to be less than million 
operating loss 
operating loss for was million compared to million for and million for excluding non cash charges for impairment losses  stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and the charges in the fourth quarter of relating to our nic commerce restructuring  the second quarter of relating to the withdrawn common stock offering  the third quarter of relating to our corporate restructuring and vacation liabilities  and the charges in  and relating to the company s application services contracts  operating loss would have been million for compared to an operating loss of million for and operating income of million for earnings before interest  taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates  depreciation  amortization  impairment losses  special charges and other non cash charges related to stock compensation and our application services contracts ebitda was negative million for compared to negative million for and positive million for ebitda from our outsourced portals segment was a positive million in and increased by approximately million from the prior year primarily due to positive contributions from portals that became fully operational in including our hawaii  idaho  montana  oklahoma and tennessee portals 
in  our hawaii  idaho and tennessee portals were under development and incurred substantial start up losses  contributing to the decrease in ebitda from ebitda from our egovernment products segment  which consists primarily of our nic conquest  nic technologies and idt subsidiaries  was negative million in and compared to negative million for the decrease in ebitda in was primarily the result of payroll related expenses for product development and product delivery efforts at nic technologies  which precipitated the third quarter restructuring as discussed above 
ebitda from our eprocurement segment was negative million in  negative million in and positive million in the decrease in ebitda in was due primarily to expenditures for business development  marketing and public relations  which also precipitated the third quarter restructuring at nic commerce 
the improvement in ebitda in was primarily the result of the organizational restructurings and headcount reductions that have taken place at nic commerce since the third quarter of corporate level expenses were million in  million in and million in corporate level expenses for the past three years are further discussed under the analysis of general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses above 
we expect to generate positive ebitda for the first quarter of and expect ebitda to improve on a sequential quarter over quarter basis throughout interest income 
interest income primarily reflects interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities portfolio 
we placed the proceeds from our july  initial public offering in short term  investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities 
interest income for the year ended december  reflects less than six months of interest earned on these investments versus a full year of interest earned in we expect other income  net  to be lower in compared to  as our cash and marketable securities portfolio was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  interest rates we currently earn are less than in prior periods 
additionally  we do expect to consume cash in with our operations turning cash flow positive late in the year 
equity in net loss of affiliates 
for the years ended december  and  equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have equity method investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the egovernment services industry  tidemark and e filing 
com  primarily for strategic purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we invested in egs  a private joint venture among swiss venture capital firm etf group  london based venture development organization vesta group  and our european subsidiary  nic european business ltd 
the purpose of egs  based in london  england  is to deliver egovernment products and services throughout western europe  with initial efforts to focus on the united kingdom 
as noted above  in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a noncash impairment loss of approximately million relating to our investment in tidemark 
in may  a private technology company acquired tidemark for cash consideration of approximately million 
nic received approximately million in cash from the transaction and has no investment balance remaining at december  e filing 
com and egs are in the early stage of their operations and are incurring net losses 
therefore  we expect to continue to record losses on our equity method investments in the foreseeable future 
however  in we expect these losses to be much lower than in and be within a range of million to million 
income taxes 
we recognized an income tax benefit in  and in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected primarily because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer  the conquest merger  the sdr acquisition and the idt acquisition  certain stock compensation costs and the goodwill relating to the sdr acquisition and conquest merger that was written off in the third and fourth quarters of as part of the intangible asset impairment charge 
in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer  the conquest merger  the sdr acquisition  the idt acquisition  and certain stock compensation costs 
in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer and certain stock compensation costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million for the decrease in cash used in operating activities is primarily the result of a positive net change in operating assets and liabilities as compared to the prior year and a year over year reduction in our operating loss excluding non cash charges 
contributing to this positive net change in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accrued expenses  partially due to subcontractor costs from our nic conquest business  and a decrease in prepaid expenses  primarily due to the amortization of the prepaid carriage fee under our arrangement with aol 
the increase in accounts receivable and payable for was primarily due to our hawaii  idaho  montana  rhode island and tennessee portals  all of which began to generate substantive revenues in the statutory fees charged for data access by our state portals are accrued as accounts receivable and accounts payable at the time services are provided 
the increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to funding operations particularly nic commerce  acquired in september  nic technologies  acquired in may  and our idaho  hawaii  tennessee and san francisco portals  which became operational after november and corporate level expenses as a result of our overall growth since becoming a public company in july and positioning for future growth  including planned strategic infrastructure investments in marketing  public relations  finance  technology and management personnel 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  we made an initial cash payment to aol totaling million in august and an additional payment of  in november  of which million was recorded as a prepaid expense in the consolidated balance sheet at december although we plan to generate positive ebitda in  we expect operating cash flow to be modestly negative through the end of  primarily due to continued project expenditures from our nic conquest business 
as further discussed in note to the note to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  due to developments arising in the second half of relating to nic conquest s migration to a common operating platform for its ucc and corporations filing applications  we determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under certain existing application development contractual obligations was not expected to cover anticipated costs of developing and implementing the related applications and accrued million for expected contract losses under percentage of completion accounting 
at december   the loss accrual for all nic conquest application development contracts was approximately million  the majority of which will be expended by the end of the third quarter of investing activities resulted in net cash generated of approximately million in reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities portfolio used for funding operations and for capital expenditures 
investing activities in also reflect approximately million in capitalized software development costs mainly from our nic commerce  nic conquest and nic technologies subsidiaries and approximately million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
investing activities for resulted in net cash generated of million  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities portfolio used for funding operations and for capital expenditures million  our business combination with conquest softworks  llc million  strategic equity investments in tidemark million and e filing 
com million  direct costs of the sdr acquisition million  our acquisition of idt million  and our investment in egs million 
investing activities for also reflect approximately million in capitalized software development costs mainly from our nic commerce and nic conquest subsidiaries 
investing activities for resulted in net cash used of million  reflecting the purchase of marketable securities with the net proceeds of our july initial public offering  the million cash outlay for our september efed acquisition  and million for capital expenditures 
financing activities resulted in net cash generated of approximately million in  primarily reflecting million in cash proceeds from a bank note payable that we used to purchase certain hardware and software components for our nic commerce subsidiary 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  primarily reflecting million to pay off bank lines of credit assumed in the sdr million and idt million acquisitions  million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and issuances of common stock to employees  million in payments to repurchase common stock and million in payments under capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  reflecting the net proceeds received from our july initial public offering  a portion of which was used to pay down all amounts outstanding under our then existing operating lines of credit 
in addition  approximately million was received from employee stock purchase and stock option transactions 
at december   the company s total cash and marketable securities balance was million compared to million at december  at december   we had posted approximately million of our cash and marketable securities as collateral for letters of credit  our million bank line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement  and our million bank note payable 
we issue letters of credit as collateral for performance on certain of our government contracts and as collateral for certain performance bonds 
these irrevocable letters of credit are generally in force for one year 
in conjunction our business filings contract with the california secretary of state  in march  we issued a million letter of credit as collateral for a performance bond required by the contract 
thus  at march   we have posted approximately million of our cash and marketable securities as collateral 
we believe that our currently available liquid resources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and current growth initiatives without the need of additional capital through the end of when we expect to begin to generate positive operating cash flow 
however  any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities or obtain a working capital line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
from time to time  we expect to evaluate the acquisition of or investment in businesses and technologies that complement our various egovernment businesses 
acquisitions or investments might impact the company s liquidity requirements or cause the company to sell additional equity securities or issue debt securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
we are currently negotiating a working capital line of credit with a bank  the purpose of which is to provide the company with greater operating flexibility and the resources to pursue opportunities that may accelerate our growth and profitability 
however  we cannot guarantee that such financing will be secured or will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company 
deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded non current deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  totaling approximately million 
we estimate that we must generate at least million of future taxable income to realize those deferred tax assets and have considered additional expected taxable losses prior to our projections of taxable income 
to achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income  we intend to pursue our current strategy of adding new local  state and federal government clients  broadening and standardizing our product and service offerings  and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals and filing applications 
based on information currently known to management  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will realize the deferred tax assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our short term investments in marketable debt securities and cash balances and the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we incur on our promissory bank notes payable 
because our investments are in short term  investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities  we are exposed to minimal risk on the principal of those investments 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
investment risk 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the e government services industry  tidemark computer systems and e filing 
com  primarily for strategic purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we invested in a private joint venture  egs  primarily to share in the risk of our international expansion and to deliver egovernment products and services throughout western europe  with initial efforts to focus on the united kingdom 
such investments are accounted for under the equity method  as we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
significant influence is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of an investee of between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors  are considered in determining whether the equity method is appropriate 
we regularly review the carrying value of these equity method investments and would record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
as discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a noncash impairment loss of approximately million relating to our investment in tidemark 
to date  we have not recorded any such impairment losses for e filing 
com or egs
