most of the company s contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  the company s clients can terminate their contracts with the company upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or production problems resulting in shortages of the product 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
these out of pocket expenses are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
as is customary in the industry  the company routinely subcontracts on behalf of its clients with independent physician investigators in connection with clinical trials 
these investigator fees are not reflected in parexel s service revenue  reimbursement revenue  reimbursable out of pocket expenses  and or direct costs  since such fees are reimbursed by customers on a pass through basis  without risk or reward to the company 
the amounts of these investigator fees were million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
direct costs primarily consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related employees  other project related costs not reimbursed by clients  and certain facilities and information systems costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of compensation and related fringe benefits for selling and administrative employees  professional services  advertising costs  and allocated costs related to facilities and information systems 
the company s stock is quoted on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol prxl 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
revenue service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as service is provided based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion  as estimated by the project managers on a monthly basis 
this method requires the company to estimate total expected revenue and total expected costs 
revenue related to contract modifications is recognized when the company has reached agreement with the client  the amounts are reasonably determinable  and the services have been performed 
generally  the assigned financial manager or financial analyst reviews contract estimates on a monthly basis 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates and the actual costs incurred  which were not recovered from clients 
in the event that future estimates are materially incorrect  they could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represents amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problems 
in the event the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there may be a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
income taxes the company s global provision for corporate income taxes is calculated using the tax accounting rules established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax amongst the taxing jurisdictions where the company operates  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
the provision is a combination of current year tax liability and future tax liability benefit that results from differences between book and taxable income that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for these future tax effects are established on the company s balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
monthly interim tax provision calculations are prepared during the year 
differences between these interim estimates and the final results for the year could materially impact the company s effective tax rate and its consolidated financial results of operations 
employee stock compensation the company elected to follow accounting principal board opinion no 
 accounting for stock options issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations in accounting for the company s employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
if the company accounted for stock options under sfas  it would have recorded additional compensation expense for the stock option grants to employees 
if the company is unable to continue to account for stock options under abp  its financial results would be materially adversely affected to the extent of the additional compensation expense it would have to recognize  which could change significantly from period to period based on several factors including the number of stock options granted and fluctuations of its stock price and or interest rates 
foreign currencies the company derives a large portion of its service revenue from operations in foreign countries 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  thus  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could significantly affect the company s results of operations 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are reported in other income expense 
adjustments from the translation of the subsidiary entities foreign functional currencies to the reported us dollars are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholder s equity 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful life 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the company has assessed the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
in fiscal year based on this assessment  there was no impairment identified at june  any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations

liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations and growth  including acquisition costs  with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
investing activities primarily reflect acquisition costs and capital expenditures for information systems enhancements and leasehold improvements 
most of the company s contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
the company s operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in the levels of billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  was days at june  compared with days at june  the decrease in dso in fiscal year as compared with fiscal was primarily due to improved billing practices and increased collection activities 
accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts was million million in billed accounts receivable and million in unbilled accounts receivable at june  and million million in billed accounts receivable and million in unbilled accounts receivable at june  deferred revenue was million at june  and million at june  days sales outstanding is calculated by adding the end of period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables  net of deferred revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts  then dividing the resulting amount by gross revenue service revenue  reimbursement revenue  and investigator fees for the most recent quarter  and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter

these lines of credit are not collateralized and are payable on demand 
at june   the company had approximately million available under these credit arrangements 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal year as compared with million used in operating activities in fiscal year the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year consisted of million of net income  million related to depreciation and amortization expense  an million increase in other liabilities  a million decrease in accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue  and million of minority interest in the net income of a consolidated subsidiary  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred income taxes  a million increase in prepaids and other assets  and a million gain on the disposal of assets 
the net use of cash in fiscal year consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue  a net loss of million  partially offset by million related to depreciation and amortization  a million decrease in deferred income taxes  a million increase in accounts payable  and a million increase in other liabilities 
net cash used by investing activities for fiscal year totaled million and consisted of of net cash used to purchase marketable securities  million used primarily for software and hardware purchases across all business segments  and million used for a business acquisition  partly offset by million in proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year totaled million and consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities and million of proceeds from the sale of assets  partially offset by million used primarily for software and hardware purchases across all business segments and million used for the acquisition of farmovs 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal year and consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in association with the company s employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal year and consisted of million from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock options and employee stock purchase plans  offset by million used to repurchase the company s common stock 
the company s primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facility related expenses 
the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if the company is unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients and or the level of contract cancellations increases  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected see risk factor for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  parexel believes that its existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs 
in the future  the company expects to consider acquiring businesses to enhance its service offerings  expand its therapeutic expertise  and or increase its global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financing  and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s contractual obligations and commitments for fiscal years subsequent to june  are as follows in thousands thereafter total operating leases       obligations under capital lease the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal year as of june   parexel did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the company regularly evaluates its exposure to such changes 
the company s overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates the company derived approximately of its service revenue for fiscal year  of its service revenue for fiscal year and of its service revenue for fiscal year  from operations outside of north america 
the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
the company may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary s functional local currency 
in cases where the company contracts for a multi country clinical trial and a significant portion of the contract expenses are in a currency other than the contract currency  the company seeks to contractually shift to its clients the effect of fluctuations in the relative values of the contract currency and the currency in which the expenses are incurred 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded foreign exchange gains of million and million  respectively 
to the extent the company is unable to shift the effects of currency fluctuations to its clients  these fluctuations could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the company occasionally enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations 
these foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturity dates ranging from one to six months 
the company does not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on its financial results see note to the consolidated financial statements 
conversion to the euro currency on january   a new currency  the euro  became the legal currency for of the member countries of the european economic community 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals were permitted to conduct business in the member countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro became the sole currency in the member countries 
parexel conducts business in seven of the member countries and converted two of those countries to the euro currency in fiscal year and the remaining five in fiscal year conversion to the euro currency did not create a material effect on either the company s financial position or its results of operations in either fiscal year or fiscal year inflation the company believes the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on its operations or financial condition
