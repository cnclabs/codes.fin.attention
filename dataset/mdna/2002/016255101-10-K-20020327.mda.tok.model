item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under factors that may affect operating results and elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview from our inception in april to july  we were engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of invisalign  a proprietary new system for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
in july  we commenced commercial sales of invisalign 
prior to july  we devoted nearly all our resources to developing our software and manufacturing processes  clinical trials of invisalign and to building our sales force  customer support and management teams 
we exited the development stage in july invisalign has two components clincheck and aligners 
clincheck is an internet based application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment  in three dimensions  by modeling two week stages of tooth movement 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a dental professional using clincheck 
in the third quarter of  we recognized revenue for the first time from the sale of invisalign and related dental impression machines manufactured by espe america  inc we expect to sell dental impression machines to an orthodontist only once  if at all 
accordingly  sales of such machines are expected to represent a lower proportion of our revenue in the future 
substantially all our revenue is generated in the us and canada  which  taken together  we regard as our domestic market 
while our expansion outside of our domestic market is still in the initial stages  we do incur substantial operating costs outside of our domestic market 
two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us in our facilities in pakistan  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted via the internet back to the us these files form the basis of our clincheck product and are used for the manufacture of aligner molds 
in addition  a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates and performs finishing work on completed aligners and ships the completed products to our customers 
our costs associated with these operations are denominated in pakistani rupees and mexican pesos 
our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations including  among others  political  social and economic instability  acts of war or terrorism  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  controlling quality of manufacture  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  and trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 
however  we believe these risks are mitigated in pakistan by the fact that our operations there do not involve the shipping or manufacturing of any physical products  and in late  we began developing facilities in the uae and costa rica which will also perform this function 
we believe the risks in mexico are mitigated by the fact that our operations there are governed under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement  or nafta 
in october  we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with discus dental impressions  inc under the terms of the agreement  discus will act as our exclusive invisalign marketing and sales representative providing training  certification  marketing and clinical support to general dentists in the us and canada 
discus is required to maintain minimum sales quotas and will earn a commission on all products shipped under the terms of the agreement 
we are required  under the terms of the agreement  to provide minimum consumer advertising commensurate with discus meeting minimum sales quotas 
the initial term of the agreement expires december   but is renewable for five years if not terminated earlier 
the agreement includes termination rights for convenience and for failure to meet agreed upon minimums 
we have not been profitable for any quarter since april  inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to have net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next months due  in part  to our national consumer advertising campaign  the expansion of manufacturing capacity  our launching of our international sales and marketing efforts and continued research and development efforts 
we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flow 
even if we do achieve profitability and positive cash flow  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis 
we earn revenue primarily from the sale of invisalign 
our revenue consists of the clincheck fee and the charge for each aligner 
we charge dental professionals a fixed fee for the treatment simulation viewed via clincheck on our website  www 
invisalign 
com 
this fee is invoiced when the dental professional orders clincheck prior to the production of aligners 
in addition  we charge dental professionals a fee for aligners upon shipment 
historically  we have shipped aligners in batches 
the first batch  which typically represented the first several months of treatment  was produced once the prescribing dental professional approved clincheck 
thereafter  aligners were sent at approximately six month intervals until completion of treatment 
in mid february  for cases where clincheck was approved  we began shipping all the aligners in a single batch 
fees from the sale of clincheck and aligners  taken together  are treated as revenues from a single invisalign case 
for cases where clincheck was approved prior to mid february  revenues associated with a given case are recognized ratably as batches of aligners are shipped to the dental professional 
for orders placed subsequent to notification of our change to single batch shipments  all of the revenues associated with a given case  including clincheck fees  will be recognized at the time the aligners are shipped 
the costs of producing the clincheck treatment plan  which are incurred prior to the production of aligners  are capitalized and recognized as related revenue is earned 
in the cases where we expect a net loss  the entire loss is recognized immediately 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues of million were derived from the sale of invisalign compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  the balance of our revenues for year ended december  and represented sales of dental impression machines  other products and training 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the compensation of staff involved in production  the cost of materials and packaging used in production and shipping  together with an allocation of the cost of facilities and depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for the year ended december  and includes and million  respectively  of unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to an increase in our manufacturing capacity in and for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we achieved positive gross margins mainly due to efficiencies achieved in manufacturing as well as reducing over capacity in many areas 
our gross loss is affected by changes in manufacturing volume  manufacturing capacity and changes in our pricing policies 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation together with the expense of professional marketing principally  conducting training workshops and market surveys  advertising and attending orthodontic trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increases in headcount and related expenses of approximately million  expenses relating to increased direct mailings of million  and expenses related to the expansion of our international sales and marketing offices of million 
partially offsetting the increase was a million decrease in advertising expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs for the compensation of administrative personnel  outside consulting services  facilities  legal expenses and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses 
we expect administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future to support expanding business activities and the additional administrative costs related to being a public company 
research and development 
research and development expenses include the cost for the compensation of staff  the costs associated with software engineering  the costs of designing  developing and testing our products and the conduct of both clinical and post marketing trials 
research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increases in headcount and related expenses of approximately million 
litigation settlement 
in february align technology was named in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed dentists excluding orthodontists in the us the complaint alleged that align technology s policy of selling invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated the us antitrust laws 
without admitting any wrongdoing  the company entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit 
the total legal and other settlement costs that align has agreed to pay are approximately  pursuant to the settlement  align will undertake to train and certify  general practice dentists each year over the next four years 
in november  the court approved the stipulation and agreement of settlement 
other income expense  net 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to expense of million for the year ended december  the interest income in fiscal was generated from higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and investments in short term and long term securities in fiscal  which included the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in january partially offsetting the interest income was a non cash interest expense of million  recorded in january  related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes 
the other expense balance of million as of december  was primarily the result of non cash interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature of a bridge loan financing 
dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
in we issued  shares of series d preferred stock which were subject to an antidilution conversion price adjustment feature which we triggered when we granted options to purchase our common stock beyond the number of options that were authorized under our plan at the time we commenced our series d preferred stock offering in may the conversion feature provided that if  during the period between may  the commitment date for our series d preferred stock offering and the earlier of the closing of an initial public offering or january   we had granted more than an aggregate of  options to purchase our common stock  then the conversion price of our series d preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original conversion price of per share 
as of the end of january  we had granted an aggregate of  options to purchase shares of our common stock in excess of the  options permitted  and we were therefore required to issue an additional  shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series d preferred stock 
these shares were in addition to the  additional shares of common stock that we were required to issue upon conversion of the series d preferred stock as of december  as a result  we recorded a deemed dividend for the year ended december  based on the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date of the series d preferred stock offering of million related to the preferred stock sold and a charge to interest expense of million for the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes that were previously converted 
deferred compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees  we recorded deferred stock based compensation as a component of stockholders equity deficit 
deferred stock based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the options  estimated using the black scholes valuation model  is initially recorded on the date of grant 
as the non employee options become exercisable  we revalue the remaining unvested options  with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge 
this stock based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for the year ended december  and million  for the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to  for the year ended december  we recorded revenues for the first time in the third quarter of for the year ended december   revenues of million were derived from the sale of invisalign compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the balance of our revenues for year ended december  and represented sales of dental impression machines 
we expect to sell a dental impression machine to an orthodontist only once  if at all 
accordingly  sales of these machines are expected to represent a substantially lower proportion of our revenue in the future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the salaries of staff involved in production  the cost of materials and packaging used in production and shipping together with an allocation of the cost of facilities and depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for the year ended december  includes million of unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to a substantial increase in our manufacturing capacity in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation together with the expense of professional marketing principally  conducting training workshops and market surveys  advertising and attending orthodontic trade shows

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs for the compensation of administrative personnel  outside consulting services  facilities  legal expenses and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses

research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs associated with software engineering  the costs of designing  developing and testing our products and the conduct of both clinical and post marketing trials 
research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  expenses through the third quarter of  until we recognized revenue for the first time from the sale of invisalign  include the costs of researching processes to manufacture our product 
other income expense  net 
other expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  this increase  partially offset by interest income on marketable securities  resulted primarily from non cash interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes 
dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
in we issued  shares of series d preferred stock 
the difference between the conversion price and the fair value per share of the common stock on the commitment date for that offering resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of million which has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the december  consolidated financial statements 
deferred compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees  we recorded deferred stock based compensation as a component of stockholders deficit 
deferred stock based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the options  estimated using the black scholes valuation model  is initially recorded on the date of grant 
as the non employee options become exercisable  we revalue the remaining unvested options  with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge 
this stock based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  income taxes we have incurred immaterial amounts of income tax expense to date since we have not been profitable 
as of december   we have aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
as of december  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we also have aggregate federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million as of december  the federal and state net operating loss and research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year for federal and for state purpose if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of approximately million of convertible preferred stock 
we have also financed our operations through equipment leases and bank loans 
in january  we received proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses incurred  as a result of our initial public offering of approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of million 
additionally  we have  of restricted cash as of december  net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in our net loss to million in fiscal  which is up from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  increases in accounts receivable 
this was offset significantly by increased non cash charges related to amortization of deferred stock compensation and depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in for fiscal  cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the initial public offering proceeds in marketable securities 
offsetting the cash used was cash provided by the maturities and sales of the marketable securities  as well as the decrease in our restricted cash balance 
for fiscal cash used in investing activities was primarily used for the investment of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities 
additionally  for the year ended december   there was a substantial increase in restricted cash of million which primarily consisted of cash related to the transfer of funds to our media buying agent to fund our national advertising campaign 
offsetting the cash used was cash provided by the maturities and sales of the marketable securities 
for fiscal cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities 
additionally  in each of these years  there was a use of cash for the purchase of clinical and manufacturing equipment  computers and facilities to support the expansion of our operations 
net cash from financing activities was million in  million in and million in for fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was attributable primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock principally through our initial public offering 
for fiscal and  cash provided by financing activities was attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and convertible promissory notes that were converted to preferred stock 
we finance capital purchases through cash and capital leases 
we had capitalized lease obligations outstanding of million at december  and million at december  our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay establishing a national brand  building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology  or to reduce our expenditures in general 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial information for the periods indicated 
this information has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of management  have been prepared on the same basis as the audited information  and includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future periods 
three month s ended december september june march december september june march in thousan ds  except per share data revenues     gross profit loss    operating loss     net loss     net loss available to common stockholders     net loss per share available to common stockholders  basic and diluted shares used in computing per share amounts  basic and diluted     historical quarterly operating results do not necessarily reflect our expectations of future quarterly operating results 
we believe that future operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors  including the rate of adoption of invisalign for the treatment of orthodontic malocclusion  the rate which manufacturing operations is scaled  the timing of automation of manufacturing processes and the extent of national direct to consumer marketing campaigns 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  warranty accrual and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers and other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and rebates 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 
we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which thee differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

 business combinations  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
it requires that all business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after september   and also applies to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
to date  the company has not engaged in a business combination 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets

the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas during fiscal year to date  the company has not recorded goodwill or other intangible assets 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods

and apb  however  this statement retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no

eitf issue no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and income statement classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to customers without charge  which the customer can use in  or exercise as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
sales incentives that fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
include offers that a customer can use to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale

 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf issue no 
addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations

the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities  existing long term debts and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
the long term debt at december  consists only of outstanding balances on lease obligations 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
our capital lease obligations of million at december  carry a fixed interest rate of and per annum with principle payments due in and monthly installments  respectively  beginning in the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term debt instruments expected maturity date as of december  to tal fair value in thousands assets cash  cash equivalents 
 short term marketable securities  weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities  weighted average interest rate liabilities fixed rate debt lease obligation weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to the available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our ability to pay long term debts at maturity 
the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term debts through the use of fixed rate debt 
management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to our decentralized or outsourced operations  whereby approximately million of our expenses are related to operations outside the united states  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure related to currency rate movements would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
