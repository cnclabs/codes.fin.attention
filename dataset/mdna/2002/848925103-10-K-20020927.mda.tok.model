such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  the actual plan of operations  business strategies  operating results and financial position of sport haley could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
sport haley s business in general is subject to certain risks including the following the demand for sport haley s products may decrease if the popularity of golf decreases or if other factors  such as a sluggish economy or inclement weather  cause golfers not to patronize golf professional shops 
sport haley must continue to design apparel that is accepted by consumers as fashionable and stylish in order to continue to have market acceptance 
sport haley s sales are seasonal  and historically sales from july through december  sport haley s first and second fiscal quarters  are weaker than sales from january through june  which are sport haley s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the market for golf apparel is extremely competitive  price competition or industry consolidation could weaken sport haley s competitive position 
sport haley maintains a significant level of finished goods inventories to support its sales volume and its corporate apparel program 
disposal of excess prior seasons inventory is an ongoing part of operations  but a significant amount of sales at the lower margins dictated by the reduction of inventories may impair sport haley s financial condition 
inventory write downs may also affect its financial condition 
sport haley depends on timely delivery of finished garments from its suppliers 
the loss of certain suppliers  and or delays in receiving garments from suppliers caused by various factors  including labor shortages and transportation difficulties  could adversely affect sport haley s ability to make timely delivery of finished garments to its customers 
sport haley s increased reliance on foreign suppliers enhances the risk that sport haley s revenues might be adversely affected if a foreign shipment were lost 
sport haley maintains insurance for risk of loss relating to goods shipped from its foreign and domestic suppliers 
however  the increased reliance on foreign suppliers heightens the risk that sport haley would be left with inadequate or unsatisfactory recourse should the goods received from the foreign suppliers be nonconforming 
sport haley purchases significant amounts of its finished apparel from two separate foreign suppliers 
if sport haley were to lose or terminate the services of either of these significant suppliers  sport haley s short term ability to fulfill its customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting sport haley s results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from sport haley s statements of income for its fiscal years ended june   and and as previously restated for its fiscal years ended june  and fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of fixed assets income loss from operations other income and expenses  net income loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the general downturn in the united states economy combined with the significant negative economic impact caused by the events of september  business trends of the golf apparel industry closely follow trends in the travel and leisure sectors of the united states economy 
the historic events of september  severely depressed the travel and leisure sectors that had already been negatively impacted by the general economic downturn experienced during calendar year as a result  sport haley experienced significant cancellations of orders during its second and third fiscal quarters as well as substantial decreases in the number of orders placed for delivery during its third fiscal quarter  as compared with the same periods in the prior fiscal years 
the cancellations and decreases in orders significantly impacted sport haley s net sales for its third quarter ended march  further  the golf apparel industry sustained an intense competitive environment throughout fiscal companies with greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley have continued to pressure their individual customers to maintain strong business relationships with them in these times of a relatively weak united states economy 
because of their status  the big name companies have a competitive advantage over sport haley in a sluggish economy  and they have the ability to maintain a greater relative share of the overall golf apparel business in such times 
sport haley  through its networks of independent sales representatives  implemented marketing strategies to strengthen relationships with its loyal haley customers and to attract new customers to the haley and ben hogan brands 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to the introduction of ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the retail outlet stores  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the laughlin  nevada retail factory outlet store 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or  as compared with approximately million in fiscal while the decrease in gross profit is consistent with the downward trend in net sales  the decrease is not entirely due to such a downward trend 
in an effort to diminish its prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories  sport haley opened a temporary retail warehouse outlet at its distribution facilities  in the fall of calendar year in its fourth quarter of fiscal  because of the relative success of the fall retail sales effort  sport haley entered into an agreement with a professional liquidator to dispose of prior seasons and closeout inventories at a liquidation retail store operation in denver  colorado 
because the liquidation effort was only marginally successful and excessive amounts of prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories remained at june   sport haley recorded a charge of approximately million to revalue prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories to the lower of cost or fair market value 
sport haley also recorded a charge of approximately  to revalue obsolete component inventories to the lower of cost or market value at june  sport haley dramatically altered its business operations during fiscal in order to place the company in a better competitive position within the golf apparel industry 
prior to fiscal  sport haley manufactured substantially all of its finished goods inventories and predominantly utilized united states vendors 
during fiscal  sport haley evolved from a company that manufactured its finished goods inventories into a company that primarily purchases its inventories from foreign suppliers 
the changes in business operations completed in fiscal included improvements in inventory purchasing controls 
because the current controls over the purchasing of finished goods inventories have attained reduced levels of finished goods inventories at the ends of recent selling seasons  management expects that sales of closeout inventories and inventory write downs will have significantly less impact on gross margins in future reporting periods 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately in fiscal as discussed above  gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal due to sales of closeout inventories at reduced selling prices combined with inventory write down adjustments of approximately million that were included in cost of goods sold 
in both fiscal and fiscal  gross margins were negatively impacted by inventory write downs and dispositions of excess and prior seasons inventories at discounted sales prices 
disposition of closeout inventories is common and recurring within the seasonal apparel business in general 
however  dispositions of closeout inventories were disproportionately higher in fiscal and fiscal than normal as a result of the slowing united states economy  adverse weather conditions and changes in sport haley s business operations and other factors 
sales of closeout inventories represented approximately of sport haley s net sales in fiscal and in fiscal and generated approximately million and million in operating cash in fiscal and  respectively 
because of the completion of significant changes in business operations that include purchasing finished goods inventories almost exclusively from foreign suppliers  the company expects to achieve higher gross margins in future years than were achieved in fiscal or in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal a significant portion of the decrease was attributable to lower commissions paid to independent sales representatives on the corresponding decrease in net sales in fiscal another significant portion of the improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was related to a decrease in accounting  legal and other expenses 
in fiscal  sport haley incurred approximately  in accounting  legal and other expenses related to the restating of sport haley s financial statements for fiscal years and and the correction of material quarterly information for the quarters of fiscal years  and the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses directly relates to management s concerted efforts to control operating expenses in fiscal the success of management s efforts to control operating expenses is evidenced by the overall decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses even after sport haley incurred start up and operational costs of approximately  relating to the introduction of ben hogan apparel in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
total other income  net  for fiscal approximated  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between fiscal years and in the rates in interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as a function of the dramatically sluggish usa economy  interest rates available on virtually risk free investments plummeted to near all time lows during fiscal sport haley continues to search for investment alternatives available within the guidelines approved by its board of directors in order to maximize the rates of return achieved on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  a difference of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the disparity between the decrease in loss from operations before provision for income taxes and the improvement in net loss between the fiscal years arose because of the difference in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording federal net operating loss carry backs in fiscal with regard to the liquidation of the subsidiary 
state income tax law requires sport haley s operating losses to be carried forward 
sport haley recorded an increase in income taxes receivable of approximately  relating to the fiscal net loss combined with the liquidation of the subsidiary and other book versus tax differences 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  a difference in net income of approximately  or  as compared with the net loss of approximately  for fiscal the difference was primarily attributable to the combination of the factors discussed above 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the decrease was attributable to several factors 
both a general slowing of the united states economy and unusually inclement weather conditions in major geographic markets were contributing factors to the decrease in net sales 
each of those circumstances contributed to late season cancellations of customer orders for spring season merchandise and a decrease in the number of golf shops that placed orders for basic goods at the opening of the spring golf season in fiscal the net decrease in sales in fiscal was also consistent with the similar negative trend with respect to the number of rounds of golf played at country club and resort courses in fiscal per published reports  the number of rounds played during fiscal were markedly less than were played during fiscal further  intense competition within the golf apparel industry continued throughout fiscal companies with greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley continued to intensify their individual marketing efforts within the golf apparel industry 
because of the increased competition with big name companies  sport haley  through its network of independent sales representatives  implemented marketing strategies in fiscal to attract new customers to the haley brand and to strengthen relationships with its long time customers 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering  shipping and sales at the laughlin  nevada retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the laughlin  nevada retail factory outlet store 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately million in fiscal while the decrease in gross profit was consistent with the downward trend in net sales  the decrease was not entirely due to such a downward trend 
sport haley dramatically altered its business operations during fiscal in order to place the company in a better competitive position within the golf apparel industry 
prior to fiscal  sport haley primarily manufactured its finished goods inventories predominantly by utilizing united states vendors 
during fiscal  sport haley evolved from a company that manufactured its finished goods inventories into a company that primarily purchases its inventories from foreign suppliers 
because of the completion of its change in operations at or near june   sport haley incurred charges to cost of goods sold of approximately  during the fiscal quarter ended june  of the  raw materials inventories were deduced by approximately  to reduce the value of those inventories to estimated amounts realizable upon disposal sales of the fabric and trim items 
this revaluation of raw materials inventories directly related to the company s exit from the garment manufacturing industry as of june  the balance of the  consisted of a charge of approximately  to reduce the valuation of prior seasons finished goods inventories to the lower of cost or market 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately in fiscal as discussed above  gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal due to cost of goods sold inventory write down adjustments of approximately  had the cost of goods sold inventory write down adjustments not been taken  gross margin would have been higher in fiscal than the margin achieved in fiscal in both fiscal and fiscal  gross margins were negatively impacted by dispositions of excess and prior seasons inventories at discounted sales prices 
disposition of closeout inventories is common and recurring within the seasonal apparel business in general 
sales of closeout inventories represented approximately of sport haley s net sales in both fiscal and fiscal and generated approximately million in operating cash from the reduction of inventories in each of the fiscal years 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  an increase of approximately million or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to additional accounting  legal and other expenses of approximately  incurred in fiscal related to the restating of the company s financial statements for fiscal years and and the correction of material quarterly information for the quarters of fiscal years  and another portion of the increase was related to increased design costs 
sport haley retained the services of donald w 
jewell during fiscal to redesign and re source the haley men s apparel collections and to design and source apparel to be included in the ben hogan apparel collections 
sales commissions expense also attributed approximately  to the increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
commissions increased primarily because of the differences between fiscal years and in the sales prices of current seasons sales 
other contributing factors to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses were increased general and health insurance premiums  increased costs of shipping materials and the increased cost of natural gas and electricity utilities 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
in august  the company formalized its decision to close its subsidiary 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sport haley recorded a charge of approximately  related to an impairment of fixed assets 
the impairment related to fixed assets used by the subsidiary in its manufacturing operations 
because of the significant increase in reliance on purchasing finished and packaged apparel from foreign suppliers  sport haley closed the subsidiary in august since that time  substantially all of the subsidiary s assets were sold at public auction 
total other income  net  for fiscal approximated  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between fiscal years in refunds of state income taxes and interest on the refunds relating to certain expenditures recorded in prior years 
income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal income loss from continuing operations for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the disparity between the decrease in income loss from operations before provision for income taxes and the decrease in income loss from operations arose because of the difference in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording net operating loss carry backs 
federal income tax law required a recalculation of the net operating loss created in fiscal  because the loss was carried back to a tax year in which the company did not file a consolidated tax return 
state income tax law requires sport haley s operating losses to be carried forward 
the company recorded an increase in income taxes receivable of approximately  relating to the fiscal loss from continuing operations 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with for fiscal net income loss for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared with approximately million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the combination of the factors discussed above combined with the approximate  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that was reported for fiscal sport haley adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin in fiscal because of adopting that standard  the company changed its method of accounting for stock options issued to non employee directors

sport haley realized no proceeds in fiscal  or from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
since december  management has been authorized by the board of directors to repurchase shares of sport haley s common stock  and an aggregate of  shares had been repurchased as of june  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in fiscal and  sport haley repurchased  and  shares at costs of approximately million and  respectively

sport haley has no commitment or obligation to purchase all or any portion of the authorized shares 
all shares purchased are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued common stock 
most of sport haley s purchases from offshore manufacturers and sales to foreign distributors are us dollar denominated and  consequently  sport haley has no material currency exchange risk
