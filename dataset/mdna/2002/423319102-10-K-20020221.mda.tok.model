item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under important factors that may affect future results below 
overview we are a world leader in the development  manufacture  and application of innovative vacuum technology solutions for the semiconductor  data storage  and flat panel display markets 
our vacuum systems provide enabling technology for several key steps within the semiconductor manufacturing process  including ion implantation  physical vapor deposition  chemical vapor deposition and etching 
semiconductor manufacturers use our systems to create and maintain a vacuum environment  which is critical to their manufacturing processes 
we are a leading provider of vacuum systems technology to the world s largest semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor manufacturers  placing us at a critical point in their advanced technology manufacturing process 
we have long standing customer relationships with many semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  including applied materials  axcelis  matsushita  novellus  varian semiconductor and veeco  as well as semiconductor manufacturers such as agere  atmel  fujitsu  infineon  intel  motorola  nec  samsung  stmicroelectronics and texas instruments 
our products are also used in a broad range of industrial manufacturing applications and advanced research and development laboratories 
we also provide an extensive range of global support and vacuum system monitoring services that lower our end users total costs of ownership 
we increase our customers system uptime through rapid response to potential operating problems 
we also develop and deliver enhancements to our customers installed base of production tools 
our service offerings include our unique guts guaranteed up time support customer response system and our innovative goldlink global on line diagnostics support system  which provides a remote e diagnostics solution that allows us to monitor  in real time  the vacuum system performance of our customers production tools 
our goldlink capability has made us a leading total solution provider in the emerging market for internet based  proactive e diagnostics for the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries 
the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor capital equipment industry  a highly cyclical business 
as a result  we have experienced significant variations in net sales  expenses  and results of operations in the periods presented and such variations are likely to continue 
net sales from sales of vacuum components and systems is recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales from global support services is comprised primarily of sales and installation of spare parts  retrofits and upgrades as well as other support services provided through our guts customer response system and goldlink support system 
global support services  including goldlink  are provided to some of our major customers under the terms of master support agreements  which typically have terms of between one and three years 
these services are provided to some of our other customers on an individual or fee for service basis 
net sales from global support services is recognized as performed or ratably over the period of the related agreements 
cost of sales consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the manufacturing of our vacuum components and systems  as well as labor and material costs associated with our global support services 
we own of a joint venture  ulvac cryogenics  inc  or uci  which manufactures and sells cryogenic vacuum pumps in japan  principally to ulvac corporation 
we account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting  and we also receive royalties from the joint venture under the terms of a license and technology agreement 
the royalties we receive from uci  as well as our equity in the income and losses of uci  are both included in our financial statements under joint venture income 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  in  a slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment impacted us after we had experienced a period of significant growth in and our net sales for were million compared with net sales for of million  a decrease of 
cost of sales for was million compared with million for  a decrease of 
the gross margin for was compared with for the reduction in gross margin was primarily attributable to decreased production volume as overhead costs were spread over a smaller sales base 
research and development expenses were million for both and  or and of net sales in and  respectively 
despite the significant near term reduction in product demand  we continued in to focus on developing technologies to support a new generation of products for millimeter capable production tools  to expand our goldlink support service capability and to improve our core component product lines 
total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared with million in our spending declined due to cost containment measures  including reductions in senior management compensation expenses  initiated during during the third quarter of  we implemented and completed a restructuring program in response to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that resulted in the reduction of approximately permanent employees 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million primarily related to severance payments and fringe benefit costs 
royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan decreased by million to million in from million in due to the decline in the japanese semiconductor capital equipment market in interest and other income for was million  compared with million for  reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances in we had a pretax loss of million in  resulting in a tax benefit of million  compared with pretax income of million and a tax provision of million for the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
these tax credits and equity income reduced our tax rate on pretax income and increased our tax rate on pretax losses 
fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  throughout  we continued to benefit from the significant increase in demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
net sales for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
cost of sales for was million compared with million for  an increase of 
total gross margin for was  compared with for the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased sales volume  offset by costs relating to a new manufacturing and engineering center in colorado  a new customer support center in taiwan and expansion of our japanese customer support center 
research and development expenses for were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for we increased our spending on projects for millimeter products  goldlink global support and ongoing improvements to our core products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in spending was primarily attributable to expenditures for increased sales activities worldwide  our locations in colorado  taiwan  and japan mentioned above  and goldlink global support 
royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan increased by million to million in from million in  due to improvements in the japanese semiconductor capital equipment market in interest and other income for was million  compared with million for  reflecting higher interest rates and higher average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances during we recorded an income tax provision of million for  compared with million for the previous year 
the and effective tax rates of and  respectively  were less than the federal statutory rate of because we benefited from research and development and other tax credits 
quarterly financial results the following table presents selected unaudited financial information for the eight quarters in the period ended december  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results and  accordingly  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

in  we spent million on capital expenditures  principally for our new japanese service center  implementation of our global information system and enhancements to the goldlink support system 
in  capital expenditures were million  principally due to the consolidation of our colorado operations into a new  square foot leased facility  the opening of our goldlink global support operations center in massachusetts  the opening of a sales and service location in taiwan  and the first phase of our global information system 
we expect our capital expenditures in will be significantly lower than cash dividends paid to our stockholders during were million  compared with million for we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of per share in and for the first three quarters of in october  after considering the current uncertain business environment in the semiconductor equipment industry  our board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend to per share  resulting in aggregate quarterly cash savings of approximately million 
we have an agreement with a bank to sell specific japanese yen denominated receivables  subject to recourse provisions 
during  approximately million of receivables were sold under these arrangements 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of these receivables sold to the bank remained outstanding 
we do not believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of this agreement 
we manage our foreign exchange rate risk arising from intercompany foreign currency denominated transactions through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these transactions are not material 
we have a three year revolving credit agreement with fleet national bank entered into in july that permits us to borrow up to million  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
loans under the credit agreement bear interest for each calendar quarter at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either the applicable libor rate or the lender s base rate  plus a varying margin 
we have no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   we are not in compliance with one of the financial covenants  relating to profitability  and therefore cannot access the line of credit at this time 
as a result  we are currently in negotiations with the bank to amend the agreement 
we believe that our existing funds and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
legal proceedings we are a defendant in an action brought in in the massachusetts superior court by raytheon company which alleges that between and we sold raytheon defective components used in missile guidance systems manufactured by raytheon 
we have not been in the business of selling these components since we have denied all claims that raytheon has asserted and succeeded in having certain claims dismissed  although these dismissals are potentially appealable at the conclusion of the trial stage of the case 
the action is in the discovery and motion phase and no trial date has been set 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and that  although the ultimate outcome of the matters cannot be predicted with certainty  the disposition of the matters should not have a material effect on our financial position 
we are also involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
in our opinion  these proceedings involve amounts that would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations if such proceedings were resolved unfavorably 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for us on january  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
the revised standards include transition rules and requirements for identification  valuation and recognition of a much broader list of intangibles as part of business combinations than prior practice  most of which will continue to be amortized 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we believe that the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
important factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements appear principally in the sections entitled business and management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
forward looking statements may appear in other sections of this report as well 
generally  the forward looking statements in this report use words like expect  anticipate  plan  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements include statements about our strategic plans  the outlook for our business and industry  anticipated expenses  anticipated sources of future revenues  and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
many such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information  future events  or otherwise 
our business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which generally have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment and have adversely affected our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that developments in the semiconductor industry or the semiconductor equipment industry will occur at the rate or in the manner that we expect 
in addition to the cyclical nature  risks  and uncertainties of the semiconductor industry  we face the following risks and uncertainties among others dependence on a limited number of customers and concentration of sales to one or a few customers  reduction of potential customers due to industry consolidation and outsourcing of the manufacture of semiconductors  the need to continuously develop  manufacture  and gain customers acceptance of new products and product enhancements  the need to achieve widespread market acceptance among our customers and others of our goldlink support initiative  our ability to continue to provide satisfactory levels of product services and maintenance and warranty support to our customers  our ability to compete successfully with current and future competitors in our industry  our ability to continue necessary capital investments during industry downturns and to anticipate or expand sales  dependence upon sole and limited source suppliers for certain components and subassemblies included in our products and systems  potential liability claims based on alleged defects in our products or errors in performing product related services  economic downturns abroad affecting our sales to foreign markets  our ability to protect our proprietary technology without substantial costs and disruption to our core business strategy  our ability to attract and retain certain key personnel  and our ability to expand through acquisitions of complementary businesses and to integrate successfully any acquired companies 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations  and stock price 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  fluctuations in exchange rates affect the period to period comparability of results 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to offset the currency exposures 
the gains and losses on these transactions partially offset the unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses of the underlying exposures 
the net gains and losses were immaterial for the years presented and were included in cost of sales 
we plan to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency contracts at december   was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be million 
the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
credit risk we are exposed to concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  investments  trade receivables  and short term foreign exchange forward contracts 
we place our cash and cash equivalents with our primary bank  a major financial institution  with a high quality credit rating 
our investments consist of money market funds  municipal government agencies and tax free bonds or investment grade securities 
we enter into short term foreign currency exchange contracts with our primary bank
