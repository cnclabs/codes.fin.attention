we were previously known as riddell sports inc we are a delaware corporation that was formed in to acquire the riddell brand football protective equipment business 
in  we effected an initial public offering of our common stock 
in  we acquired varsity spirit corporation  a leader in the spirit industry 
in june we sold the riddell group division and in september we changed our name to varsity brands  inc part i item business general varsity is the leading marketer and manufacturer of branded products and services to the school spirit industry  and is also a leading provider of branded services to various other extracurricular activities 
under our many brands  the best known of which are varsity spirit fashions and universal cheerleaders association  all of which we own  we are o the largest designer  marketer and supplier of cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories  o the biggest operator of cheerleading and dance team training camps and clinics  o a leading organizer of special events for extracurricular activities  o a major provider of studio dance conventions and competitions  o a producer of studio dance apparel for studio dance competitions 
we have built our various brands and lines of business  in large part  based upon our year round relationship marketing strategy  which we have established and refined during the course of our twenty seven years in the school spirit industry 
this strategy involves integrating our core cheerleading business with our other activities  including conducting training camps  clinics and conventions  and producing various nationally televised and regional championships in the us and performance events in the us and europe 
each of these activities  which are in themselves profitable  reinforce each other and the sale of our products  while they enhance participation in the extracurricular market and build loyalty to our brands 
we believe that our varsity spirit fashions brand cheerleading uniforms are worn by more high school and college cheerleaders than any other brand 
our cheerleading camps were attended by more than  students in  more than  people traveled to the walt disney resorts in orlando  florida and anaheim  california to participate in and view our various cheerleading and dance competitions 
significant developments as noted above  on june   the company completed the sale of its riddell group division to an acquisition affiliate of lincolnshire management  inc lincolnshire  a new york based  private equity fund 
the purchase price  which was determined by an arms length negotiation  was for approximately million in cash  plus an adjustment to cover seasonal funded indebtedness incurred by the riddell group division during the sale was effected pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated april  between the company and lincolnshire 
the riddell group division included i all of the company s team sports business  excluding umbro branded team soccer products  ii the company s licensing segment  which allows third parties to market certain products using the riddell and macgregor trademarks  and iii the company s retail segment  including the new york executive office  which managed the retail and licensing segments  and marketed a line of sports collectibles and athletic equipment  principally to retailers in the united states  and to a limited extent internationally 
in conjunction with the sale of the riddell group division  the company recognized a decline in value of its net minority investment in a company who makes game uniforms on behalf of the riddell group division 
the company had previously accounted for its investment in the game uniform company using the equity method of accounting 
as a result of the sale of the riddell group division and the write down in the value of its minority investment in the game uniform company  the company recorded a loss on the sale of the riddell group division of million million after tax in see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
in september  the company settled the litigation that it had brought in march against umbro worldwide  ltd 
and its related companies umbro involving the licensing agreement that the company had entered into with umbro in november the umbro license 
specifically  the company brought suit in the southern district of new york seeking to prevent certain breaches by umbro of its agreement with varsity pertaining to  inter alia  its sale of products in the united states via the internet and its threatened change of market positioning of certain umbro products previously sold by signal apparel  inc in connection with settling this litigation  the umbro license was terminated  pursuant to which the company received  among other things  a cash payment of million 
in addition  the company is collecting its outstanding receivables under the umbro license  and has sold its remaining inventory back to umbro 
the amount for which the company is to receive from the sale of inventory is currently in dispute and will be resolved by a third party arbitrator 
the final amount to be received from the sale of umbro inventory is not known at this time  currently the final settlement can range from million to million 
under the umbro license  varsity had the exclusive right to sell umbro branded soccer apparel  equipment and footwear to soccer specialty stores and others in the team channel of distribution  principally in the united states 
business segments we presently employ our integrated sales and marketing strategy and operate our business through various wholly owned subsidiaries in principally two business segments  i uniforms and accessories  and ii camps and events 
historically  our uniforms and accessories segment has been responsible for revenues in slightly more than fifty eight percent of total revenues  and our camps and events segment has contributed the balance of the revenues 
uniforms and accessories we design  market and manufacture cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories  including sweaters  sweatshirts  jumpers  vests  skirts  warm up suits  t shirts  shorts  pompons  socks  jackets  pins and gloves 
we market all of our cheerleading uniforms and accessories under the varsity spirit trademark 
approximately  catalogs are mailed annually to schools and school spirit advisors and coaches containing color photographs and descriptions of our varsity spirit line of uniforms and accessories 
we supplement our direct sales force and catalog sales efforts with a telemarketing sales force of eleven full and part time employees 
camps and events we operate cheerleader and dance team camps in the united states 
camp enrollment has increased every year since the camp division commenced operation in with cheerleading camps and  participants 
during the camp season  approximately  participants  consisting of students and their coaches  attended varsity s universal cheerleader association and united spirit association camps  including over  participants representing colleges and junior colleges 
during  cheerleading and or dance team squads from approximately of the universities comprising the atlantic coast  big east  big ten  big twelve  pacific and southeastern collegiate athletic conferences attended our camps 
a significant majority of our cheerleader and dance team camps are conducted on college or junior college campuses 
we contract with the colleges and universities for the provision of housing  food and athletic facilities 
our camps generally are conducted over a four day period and are attended by resident and commuting students 
our instructors are mostly college cheerleaders who may have previously attended our camps  and we believe that our training of many of the top college cheerleading squads augments our recruiting of high school and junior high school camp participants 
prior to the commencement of our camps  instructors participate in an intensive six day training session where they are taught new cheerleading and dance material 
we also place a high degree of emphasis on teaching our instructors the most up to date teaching  training and safety techniques 
we were a founding member of and remain an active participant in the american association of cheerleading coaches and advisors  an industry trade group whose mission is to improve the quality of cheerleading and to maintain established safety standards 
in  this industry trade group published comprehensive certification and safety guidelines for cheerleading coaches 
we follow the safety guidelines established by the association of cheerleading coaches and advisors in the training of our instructional staff and in the conduct of our cheerleader and dance team camps and competitions 
we promote our varsity spirit brand products and services  as well as the school spirit industry  through active and visible association with the following annual championships and television specials o national high school cheerleading championship r o national dance team championship r o college cheerleading and dance team national championship r o national all star cheerleading championship r o company dance championship r these championships and special events have been regularly televised on the espn television network and have been sponsored by various companies and products  including nike  degree  at t  dell  the walt disney world resort  and gillette 
in addition to promoting cheerleading and dance team activities  these championships  television specials and events are a source of revenues for us 
in  over  persons  including cheerleaders and their families  attended our special events 
other we are continuing to expand our uniform design  manufacturing and special event expertise from cheerleading into the private dance studio market through our venture called company dance 
in june  we acquired certain of the assets of the netherland corporation starlight productions  one of the larger studio dance competition companies 
while starlight productions historical operations and assets are not material in comparison to our financial statements  we feel that this acquisition combined with our existing company dance convention business will help us to expand our entree into the studio dance business 
company dance operates weekend dance conventions and competitions in thirty us cities  an annual convention championship from the walt disney resort in orlando that is televised on espn and two annual competition championships 
we also operate intropa  a tour company  which specializes in organizing trips for cheerleaders  bands  choirs and orchestras  dance and theater groups and other school affiliated or performing groups  which tour in the continental united states  hawaii  canada  europe and israel 
relationship marketing our marketing model is based upon our longstanding relationships with three distinct but equally important groups 
first  our direct sales efforts  through personalized service  creates an important connection to the participants  coaches and instructors of school spirit activities and other extracurricular activities primarily in junior and senior high schools 
second  instructors and staff at our camps  clinics and performance tours and events motivate participants to get more instruction and become better competitors 
third  we increase our brand awareness and enhance our relationships with our customers through our affiliations with strategic partners such as the walt disney company  espn and other media and marketing entities 
these strategic relationships and the televised shows that we produce reinforce the importance of our events and competitions 
we believe that our sales and marketing strategy provides us with a competitive advantage  and features the following key components o cross marketing of products and promotional activities o camps and clinics o special events  conventions and competitions o uniforms and accessories o key marketing alliances o internet operations o direct sales force cross marketing and promotional activities since  we have conducted  and we continue to refine  profit generating activities  which are an integral part of our promotional efforts 
we create relationships through our camps and events and believe that these relationships naturally translate to a sales opportunity for our cheerleading uniforms or dance costumes when the campers return to school 
when the sales force interacts with cheerleaders or dance team participants and their coaches during the design and fitting of custom uniforms  they also have the opportunity to reinforce participation in our camps and special events 
we intend to extend this strategy to other extracurricular activities 
the marketing of our various activities is designed to provide logical extensions to basic participation and to encourage participants  as they improve  to increasingly utilize more of our products and services 
all of our marketing activities are designed so that each of our various products and services reinforce one another  as well as strengthen overall brand awareness and loyalty 
how we cross market is evident from our marketing of special events and competitions for cheerleaders 
for example  in order to participate in the various special events that we offer  such as the nationally televised macy s thanksgiving day parade in new york city  a cheerleader must attend and excel at one of our camps 
our camps are the only place that a cheerleader can get an invitation to appear in one of our special events 
similarly  we hold local cheerleading competitions that progress to various regional levels during the course of the fall  which are the only way for a team to qualify for our championships which are held at the walt disney resort in orlando  florida and nationally televised on espn 
camps events our approach to relationship building has inter related parts 
in the case of cheerleading it is our camps which  more than anything else  build brand loyalty 
special events  conventions and competitions enhance our relationship marketing 
just as our camps build loyalty with respect to cheerleading  special events  conventions and competitions  for other extracurricular activities can build new allegiances from participants in a wide variety of other extracurricular activities 
we run regional and national cheerleading and dance team competitions  organize national dance competitions for young individuals through our studio dance division  and sponsor youth soccer tournaments 
the national competitions and finals for these activities are typically held at the walt disney resort in orlando  florida and are televised on espn and or espn participants in the school spirit activities that we target are also given the opportunity to take part in various performance events in the united states and europe 
these events include parades  such as the annual macy s thanksgiving day parade in new york city and year end parades in london and paris 
we also arrange pre game and half time shows for college football bowl games 
we intend to extend our promotional activities to a greater number of extracurricular activities with soccer and dance the most likely next additions 
uniforms and accessories the cheerleaders who participate in our special events  such as parades  often come from a variety of schools 
they each need a uniform for the special event so that they can portray a unified appearance 
we design and sell such uniforms and also sell a travel package  including hotel arrangements  to the participants in our special events 
at the same time  because participation in our various promotional activities enhances our bond with cheerleaders  we believe that their team is more likely to buy our uniforms and accessories 
key marketing alliances we also have longstanding marketing alliances with other strategic partners such as the walt disney company  espn and other media and marketing entities 
we are currently in our th year of broadcasting championship events on espn and espn  and our current agreement with espn extends through the year we have been holding championship events at the walt disney world resort in orlando  florida since  and our current agreement with the walt disney company extends through the year all of these alliances serve to further emphasize the prominence and importance of the activity and the participant 
all of these marketing relationships also enhance one another and serve to reinforce and cross market our products and services 
internet operations we believe that our internet operations  which are described further below  are a logical extension and application of this approach and are designed to enhance our contact with customers and build brand loyalty 
direct sales force our comprehensive relationship marketing and sales strategy is made possible by our comprehensive sales efforts which are responsible for developing and maintaining relationships among the  junior and senior high schools  and colleges in the united states 
our sales force develops relationships with participants  coaches and instructors of school spirit activities throughout the us by providing value added services that enhance participation in the activities 
examples of this include providing clinics  and quickly servicing  designing and fitting custom uniforms for participants in cheerleading 
production cheerleading and dance team uniforms and accessories most of the cheerleading and dance team uniforms designed  manufactured and marketed by us are made to order 
the manufacturers provide knitting  cutting  sewing  finishing and shipping  and we provide the patterns  fabrics  yarn and manufacturing specifications and quality control supervision 
we also provide some cutting  knitting and lettering at two specialized production facilities 
the use of independent manufacturing facilities to fulfill our production needs affords us with the flexibility to adjust our production output to meet our highly seasonal selling cycle 
the use of independent manufacturers also reduces our fixed costs  which we believe is beneficial in a highly seasonal business 
cheerleading accessories such as shoes  pompons and campwear are purchased from various suppliers including nike  adidas  body wrappers  and top sox  among others 
we have expanded the variety and number of accessories we market  which has contributed to the increase in our revenues in recent years 
our internet operations we believe that we can take advantage of commercial opportunities offered by electronic community building and commerce as it relates to the extracurricular activities market because we have the largest nationwide proprietary sales force in the us in the extracurricular activities market 
we believe that our internet strategy of building community sites and simultaneously establishing complementary commerce sites affords us an opportunity to extend our relationship sales and marketing strategy to expand our core business and to develop new lines of business 
we launched our internet business in the fourth quarter of with a community web site with e commerce elements for cheerleaders  www 
varsity 
com 
in the third quarter of we launched www 
codance 
com  our website for company dance 
seasonality our operations are highly seasonal 
in recent years  our operations have been most profitable in the second and third quarters  with the third quarter typically the strongest  while losses have typically been incurred in the first and fourth quarters 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited operating results of continuing varsity operations for each of the four quarters in and  not including the operating results of the two business units discontinued in the riddell group and umbro divisions  and the extraordinary gain on bond redemption 
you should read this information together with the consolidated financial statements  the notes related to those financial statements and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter year ended december  revenues     percent of total annual revenues income loss from continuing operations     year ended december  revenues     percent of total annual revenues income loss from continuing operations     this seasonal pattern is influenced by the following factors o cheerleading and dance uniforms and accessories are typically ordered and shipped between late march  when new cheerleaders are selected for the coming school year  and the end of august  just before the new school year begins 
o we incur costs relating to our camp business during the first and second quarter as we prepare for the upcoming camp season  while most revenue relating to the camps is earned during the period from june to august 
company dance competitions and conventions primarily take place during the first and second quarters which may temper this segment s seasonality 
competition spirit products and services we are one of two major companies that design and market cheerleader  dance team and booster club uniforms and accessories on a national basis 
besides us and our major national competitor  national spirit group  there are many other smaller regional competitors serving the uniform and accessories market in the united states 
we believe that the principal factors governing the selection of cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories are the quality  variety  design  delivery  service and  to a lesser extent  price 
we are also one of two companies that annually operate a significant number of cheerleader and dance team camps in the united states  again the other being national spirit group 
there are also many other smaller companies and schools that operate cheerleading camps and clinics on a regional basis 
we believe that the principal factors governing the selection of a cheerleader or dance team camp or clinic are the reputation of the camp operator for providing quality instruction and supervision  location  schedule and the tuition charged for camp participation 
we compete with showbiz  starpower  showstoppers  tremaine  west coast dance explosion  new york city dance alliance  and other smaller national and regional companies in operating studio dance conventions and competitions 
we believe the principal factors governing the selection of a studio dance convention or competition are the reputation of the dance operator for providing quality instruction and supervision  location  schedule and tuition charged for convention competition 
trademarks and service marks we own various common law and registered trademarks in the us and various foreign countries including the following universal cheerleaders association  varsity spirit  united spirit association  co 
dance  national high school cheerleading championship  the universal dance association  universal dance camps  varsity spirit fashions and the national dance team championship  among others 
regulation there is no national governing body regulating cheerleading and dance team activities at the collegiate level 
although voluntary guidelines relating to safety and sportsmanship have been issued by the ncaa and some of the athletic conferences  to date cheerleading and dance teams are generally free from rules and restrictions similar to those imposed on other competitive athletics at the college level 
however  if rules limiting off season training are applied to cheerleading and or dance teams similar to rules imposed by the ncaa on some inter collegiate sports  it is likely that we would be unable to offer a significant number of our camps either because participants would be prohibited from participating during the summer or because enough suitable sites would not be available 
although we are not aware of any school officially adopting these activities as a competitive sport  recognition of cheerleading and or dance teams as sports would increase the possibility that cheerleader or dance activities may become regulated 
we currently do not believe that any regulation of collegiate cheerleading or dance teams as a sport is forthcoming in the foreseeable future  and in the event any rules are proposed to be adopted by athletic associations  we expect to participate in the formulation of such rules to the extent permissible 
at the high school level  some state athletic associations have classified cheerleading as a sport and in some cases have imposed certain restrictions on off season practices and out of state travel to competitions 
however  in all cases to date  we have been able to work with these state athletic associations to designate acceptable times for the cheerleaders within these states to attend camps 
we have also signed agreements with several state associations to assist with sponsoring and executing official competitions within these states 
to date  state regulations have not had a material effect on our ability to conduct our normal business activities 
operations at all of our facilities are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency and various other regulatory agencies 
employees at december   we had approximately employees 
approximately of these employees were employed on a full time basis and approximately were part time or temporary employees 
during the summer of  we employed approximately  summer camp instructors  trainers and administrators on a seasonal basis

the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition reflects changes occurring in the company s income from continuing operations  exclusive of the discontinued operations of riddell group division and the umbro division 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues from the sale of the uniforms and accessories increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an overall strong increase in most product categories  primarily uniforms and lettering  offset by a slight decrease in campwear and shoe sales 
the significant increase in revenues is a direct result of quicker delivery of uniforms and accessories combined with higher merchandise sales generated at our instructional camps 
the improvement in delivery times is partially attributable to improvements made to the company s order entry system combined with better availability of inventory items for delivery 
the improvement in camp merchandise sales is partially attributable to the consolidation of merchandising and warehousing activities within our camps and events division 
revenues from camps and events increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues for the year is directly attributable to the following i a revenue growth  or million  in our studio dance competitions and conventions  such growth being directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets of the netherland corporation  an operator of dance competitions  in june  and ii a increase in camp participants during the year of as compared to the same period in such increases were offset somewhat by a decrease in the number of choir and band tours handled by the company s group tour business during gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  gross margin rates increased by percentage points to for the year ended december  from in the year ended december  gross margins rates for the uniforms and accessories segment increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the percentage increase was primarily due to a shift in the mix of products sold from lower margin stockable items to higher margin custom uniforms  combined with excellent on time delivery of production and piece goods which resulted in lower delivery costs and sales discounts 
these increases were offset by lower margins earned on the new performance dance wear line as compared to our other uniform lines combined with slightly higher manufacturing costs associated with the new warehouse and production facility 
gross margin rates for the camps and events segment increased slightly to in the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the gross margin rate is primarily due to the overall decrease in the company s group tour operations  which have historically generated lower gross margins than the other parts of the company s business  therefore  the decrease in group tour operations resulted in an overall increase in the segment s gross margin rate 
the increase is also partially due to increased participation in the company s studio dance competitions and conventions  which have historically generated higher gross margins than the cheerleading and dance camps 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the following factors in  the company accrued a  bonus  no such bonus was accrued in  the company recognized approximately  in costs associated with abandoning its old corporate headquarters  and certain corporate administrative expenses are now being allocated over a smaller revenue basis

income taxes interest tax expense in consisted of a provision for federal alternative minimum tax  with an offsetting deferred tax benefit 
income tax expense in reflects an adjustment relating to the valuation of deferred taxes 
no other net tax expense was recorded in or liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of our working capital needs is primarily impacted by three factors 
first  a significant portion of the products we sell are sold throughout the year on dated payment terms  with the related receivables becoming due when the school year begins during the following july to october period 
second  we incur costs relating to our summer camp business during the first and second quarter as we prepare for the upcoming camp season  while camp revenues are mostly collected in the june to august period 
lastly  outstanding balance of our debt structure impacts our working capital requirements as the semi annual interest payments on our currently million of senior notes outstanding come due each january and july 
prior to the consummation of the sale of riddell group division  there were million of of senior notes outstanding 
in accordance with certain provisions of the senior notes  the company subsequently repurchased an aggregate of million in principal amount of senior notes following the sale of the riddell group division 
specifically  million in principal amount of senior notes in open market purchases in the third and fourth quarters of for an aggregate purchase price of million  and million in principal amount of senior notes in the company s modified dutch auction tender offer completed in december for an aggregate purchase price of million 
to finance the company s seasonal working capital demands  we maintain a credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit 
upon the sale of the riddell group division  the company repaid all indebtedness then outstanding under its credit facility  approximately million  and in conjunction therewith  the company amended and reduced its revolving credit facility from million to million 
the outstanding balance on the company s credit facility follows the seasonal cycles described above  increasing during the early part of the operating cycle in the first and second quarters of each year and then decreasing from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as collections are used to reduce the outstanding balance 
at december  there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility 
this compares with outstanding balances of million at december our current debt service obligations are significant and  accordingly  our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend on our future performance and is subject to financial  economic and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  due to the seasonality of working capital demands described above  year over year growth in our business and working capital could lead to higher debt levels in future periods 
we believe that operating cash flow together with funds available from our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current debt service  seasonal and other current working capital requirements
