item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during the past five fiscal years  the company has increased the number of centers from  at the beginning of fiscal year  to at fiscal year end the company has achieved this growth through a combination of acquisitions  prototype build to suit centers  and new leases 
fiscal growth consisted of new build to suit leased centers and one management contract  due to the company s new strategy to focus on improving existing operations 
during the fiscal year  the company closed under performing centers  of which had been identified in its restructuring plan at the prior fiscal year ended march  the company has maintained its strategic plan of identifying short and long term profitability goals and identified areas designed to improve productivity and reduce operating costs 
the company is subject to certain risks common to the providers of child care and early education  including dependence on key personnel  dependence on client relationships  competition from alternate sources or providers of the company s services  market acceptance of work and family services  the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  the company s ability to manage its overall cost structure and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these statements management makes certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the amounts of revenue and expenses for each period presented 
the application of the company s accounting policies  in certain instances  requires the exercise of judgment and assumptions that pertain to future uncertainties and as a result  actual future results could differ from management s estimates 
the accounting policies management believes are critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets  liability for workers compensation insurance obligations  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  which requires that the following criteria be met before recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenues consist primarily of tuition paid by parents  supplemented in some cases by payments either partial or in total from government agencies 
each agency has its own set of guidelines in administering subsidies and management must constantly monitor affected centers to ensure compliance 
revenues also include  to a lesser degree  management fees paid by corporate sponsors 
revenue is recognized as services are performed 
in some 
table of contents centers the company receives revenue in advance of services being rendered  in which case  revenue is deferred until the services have been provided 
accounts receivable 
the company generates accounts receivable primarily from fees charged to governmental agencies  and to a lesser degree parents 
the company monitors collections and payments from these customers and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on historical trends and current overall economic conditions 
amounts charged to this provision for uncollectible accounts receivable have historically been within the company s expectations  but there can be no assurance that future experience will be consistent with the company s past experience 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as acquired goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  annually  and  when events and circumstances occur that may indicate impairment  management evaluates the recoverability of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the associated projected undiscounted annual cash flows 
management also considers business prospects  market trends and other economic factors in performing this evaluation 
the extent of the impairment is measured as the difference between the fair market of the asset and its carrying value  with fair market value calculated using projected future discounted cash flows 
based on this evaluation  the company recorded a charge to operations of   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
if actual results or circumstances are less favorable than those forecasted by management  or if upon completion of the new impairment tests under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company identifies an impairment  a future charge may be required 
sfas no 
became effective for the company beginning in fiscal additional information regarding sfas no 
is set forth in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liability for workers compensation insurance obligations 
the company self insures a significant portion of its workers compensation insurance plans 
the full extent of certain liabilities  in many cases  may not become fully recognized for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires management to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
due to differences in the timing of the recognition of items included in income for financial accounting and tax purposes  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
the likelihood of recovery of these assets is dependent on the company s ability to implement its tax planning strategy  which includes the sale and closure of certain centers 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  the company would be required to take a charge  which could have a material effect on the company s financial results 
additionally  there are capital loss carryforwards that must be offset by capital gains in future years 
the company anticipates capital gains sufficient to cover the capital loss carryforwards in future years
