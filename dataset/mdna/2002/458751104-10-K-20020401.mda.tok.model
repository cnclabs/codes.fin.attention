item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations historical factors affecting financial performance we were incorporated in california in february and reincorporated in delaware in july from to  we developed and refined our force sensing resistor  or fsr  technology and sold it to customers for electronic  musical  medical and other applications  which we now refer to as the specialty components market 
in  we introduced our first interlink branded computer pointing device  portapoint  and in  we introduced our first wireless pointing device 
the device  called remotepoint  established interlink as a leading supplier of branded and oem remote controls and other products for the computerized presentation system market 
in  we introduced the electronic signature capture product  epad  for our e transactions market 
in  we first demonstrated intuitouch technology for the home entertainment market 
in accordance with recent securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included on page f of this report 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exsists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and could require management s judgements regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company s accounts receivables are unsecured  and the company is at risk to the extent such amounts become uncollectible 
the company continually monitors account receivable balances  and provides for an allowance of doubtful account at the time collection may become questionable based on payment history or age of the receivable and other factors related to the customers ability to pay 
we first achieved profitable operations in because of net operating loss carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we did not accrue income tax expense until in that year  due to the expiration or full utilization of nol carryforwards in california and japan  we began to record a provision for income tax expense in those jurisdictions 
by the end of  we also began to accrue an income tax benefit related to our federal nol carryforwards to be used in future periods 
however  in mid  we began to record quarterly tax losses and suspended any further recognition of nol carryforward tax benefits 
management believes we will be able to utilize the net deferred tax asset  however  if we do not return to quarterly profitability in  it is likely that we will eliminate this asset million by recording a tax expense 
other income expense was significant in and as the result of a non recurring legal settlement expense in and an expense associated with a public offering of our securities that was cancelled in prior to  operations was a net user of cash that we funded through existing cash balances  private placements of equity and to a lesser extent  bank and lease financing 
in  operations was a net provider of cash  generating million 
in and  operations was essentially cash flow break even to marginally positive 
in response to the economic slowdown in mid  we restructured our operations and adjusted our inventory and bad debt reserves by million and  respectively 
we believe these estimates of potential losses are adequate at december  however  a further deterioration of the financial health of our customers either in the us or japan may prove those estimates to be inadequate 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communications market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately of our revenues came from japanese customers 
the primary end user market for the business communications market is the us  however our japanese customers are affected by the on going recession in japan 
revenues from these customers are denominated in japanese yen and as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure 
the gain or loss from these contracts is recorded in business communications revenue  gain in 
these contracts typically have a six month duration  thus  yen dollar fluctuations lasting more than six months will have an impact on our revenues 
in addition  as our japan subsidiary s functional currency is the yen  the translation of the net assets of that subsidiary into the consolidated results will fluctuate with the yen dollar exchange rate 
we licensed certain technology related to the production of fsr sensors to international electronics and engineering iee  a former affiliate based in luxembourg  for use in connection with sales of sensors to the automotive industry 
we received significant payments under this license agreement commencing in million and continuing through the third quarter of million 
no further payments are due under this agreement 
we have occasionally licensed other aspects of our technology in connection with the settlement of intellectual property disputes and expect to continue to do so in the future 
however  there are no current contingencies under which we would earn significant licensing revenue 
overview revenue by market segment is shown in the following table percent of market segment revenue total sales business communications million specialty components million home entertainment million e transactions million our principal source of revenue continues to be our business communications market 
sales in that market declined as a result of general economic conditions and resulting adjustments to purchasing and inventory levels by our customers 
however  our market position continues to be very strong and we should be in a position to benefit from any upturn in sales of presentation systems 
specialty components  our original market  continues to be a strong contributor to revenue 
in and the first three quarters of  revenue in this market segment was positively affected by licensing revenue from iee  which will not recur in we expect specialty components to continue to be a significant contributor to our revenue but do not anticipate significant growth in this market 
as noted elsewhere in this report  our e transactions business was adversely affected during the period by a general slowdown in new equipment purchasing  nonetheless  we have consummated significant transactions with two insurance companies and two companies in the financial services industry and continue to build our volume of sales in smaller orders 
at both large and small volumes  sales of e transaction devices tend to result in one time revenue and therefore sales levels in this segment can be more volatile than in other markets in which we operate 
however  we believe that the increasing installed base of our e transactions devices can have a positive effect on future sales by providing evidence of technological soundness and customer acceptance 
revenue in the home entertainment sector results primarily from sales of an fsr based component for use in the microsoft xbox game controller 
we expect that these sales will continue in but that revenue from our intuitouch products will develop slowly as new technologies are introduced by our customers and development partners 
at the date of this report  we do not expect meaningful revenues from intuitouch products until in  we recorded our first annual decline in revenue in more than a decade and our first annual loss since we believe that these results were significantly affected by general economic conditions that affected purchasing levels in our established business communications and specialty components markets and slowed penetration in our new e transactions and home entertainment markets 
in the case of particular industries  such as the insurance industry that we have targeted for our e transactions products  the events of september further impacted our ability to achieve penetration levels that we had originally anticipated 
while these factors may continue to affect our results in  we believe that our basic market positioning is sound 
we continue to enjoy a dominant share of the oem business presentations controller market and are having some success in developing sales channels for branded aftermarket products 
our fsr based products and components continue to sell well in both our specialty components and our home entertainment markets  our e transactions business appears to be gaining traction and we believe that our technology  products and commercial relationships addressing interactive digital remote communication put us in a position to capitalize on any growth in this market sector 
despite the downturn in revenues in  we chose to maintain our commitment to research and development  spending slightly more in than in the prior year and also increased selling  general and administrative expense 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of a continued decline in revenues and customer demand  the company provided additional reserves of million for excess and obsolete inventories 
the continued industry wide reduction in spending and the resulting decrease in demand for the company s products led to significant reductions in the company s sales forecast 
the company s regular and ongoing reserve analysis and methodology includes a comparison of sales forecasts and inventory levels 
as a result of the analysis based on second quarter sales forecast revisions  the company recorded a charge  which was included in the cost of revenues 
increases to the inventory reserve during the remainder of fiscal were not significant 
in addition  we recorded a  increase in bad debt reserves in the third quarter of due to changes in certain customers ability to pay arising after the original sales had been made 
the loss in resulted in modest reductions in working capital and stockholders equity 
however  liquidity remains relatively strong and we foresee no immediate need for additional capital or immediate risk of capital inadequacy 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues gross profit operating expenses product development and research selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenues decreased from million in to million in this revenue decline is a result primarily of the worldwide slowdown in sales to the business communications and specialty components markets 
in addition  the expiration of the iee license agreement yielded million lower royalty revenues in gross profit as a percentage of sales declined to in from in due primarily to the million excess inventory reserve adjustment in the second quarter of product development and research expense increased from million in to million in while increasing to as a percentage of sales from 
the increase reflects our continuing commitment to develop products that will support our leadership position in our existing and targeted markets 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in the higher dollar amount in reflects a full year expense for individuals hired in for the e transactions and home entertainment segments  coupled with the  adjustment to bad debt reserves in the third quarter of we implemented a cost reduction plan in the second quarter of that resulted in a reduction of quarterly sg a expenses to million by the fourth quarter 
thus extrapolating fourth quarter sg a  the current annual run rate of sg a is at a lower level than the million sg a for in  we recorded an additional deferred tax asset of  related to our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
due to a lack of quarterly profitability  we suspended further additions to the deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of however  management believes the net deferred tax asset million will be realized 
for the year  our operating loss was million and the net loss was million due primarily to the lower revenues and the inventory reserve adjustment in the second quarter 
fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenues increased from million in to million in this revenue growth was a result primarily of growth in sales to the business communications market and  to a lesser extent  from a twofold increase in home entertainment sales to million reflecting our initial penetration of that market 
gross profit as a percent of sales improved to in from in due to growth in home entertainment and million in licensing revenues 
product development and research expense increased from million in to million in while increasing marginally as a percentage of sales 
the increase reflects our continuing commitment to develop products that will support our leadership position in our existing and targeted markets 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in 
the percentage increase reflects the creation of sales and marketing teams for the home entertainment and e transaction markets 
in  we recorded a nonrecurring expense of  related to a cancelled public stock offering 
in  we recorded a deferred tax asset of  related to our million in federal net operating loss carryforwards 
operating income was million and net income was million in  the increases over were primarily attributable to increased sales 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of revenue 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to fairly present the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss revenue declined on a quarter to quarter basis during the year  primarily as a result of worsening conditions in the business communications market in japan 
the principal factor affecting the decline from the third to the fourth quarter was the loss of licensing revenue from iee  thus the decline in revenue from other sources between the two last quarters of the year was actually less severe than declines earlier in the year 
early indications are that revenue in the first quarter of will be at or slightly above fourth quarter levels  indicating a bottoming out in the current adverse business cycle 
our current business plan calls for profitable operations in the second half of  based on numerous assumptions which include a reversal of the decline in sales of computerized presentation systems and increasing penetration of the e transactions market 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million versus million at the end of the decrease is a result primarily of the operating loss for the year operations generated a positive cash flow of  in as compared to an  negative cash flow in the improvement is due primarily to lower accounts receivable balances partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
we spent  in and  in to purchase additional manufacturing equipment and computer equipment related to our internal computer network 
primarily from japanese banks  we received proceeds from unsecured long term bank loans of million and million in and respectively 
we made payments on long term debt of million and million in and respectively 
net proceeds for the exercise of stock options were million and million in and respectively 
we believe we can fund operations for at least the next twelve months from our current cash and marketable security balances million 
secondly  we have a maximum amount available under our japanese bank line of credit of million  none of which was used as of december  our us line of credit was unused at december  and had million of availability as of that date 
we have a million equipment lease line   was used at december  at december  we were in violation of certain financial covenants related to our us lines of credit  we received a waiver of those covenants from the bank 
we anticipate we will be out of compliance with these covenants in early and as a result we are currently re negotiating the agreements to remove these covenants 
it is likely that the new agreements will require the lines of credit to be fully secured by cash deposited at that bank 
the exercise of outstanding stock options is also a potential source of equity capital that may be available to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued two statements sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provided guidance on the accounting for business combinations  require all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method  discontinue amoritization of goodwill  define when and how intangible assets are amortized  and require an annual impairment test for goodwill 
we will adopt these statements in and are currently reviewing these statements to determine their impact  however  we do not expect the adoption of these statements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this standard also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the provisions of this standard are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our japanese subsidiary  interlink electronics kk  generally makes sales and collects its accounts receivable in japanese yen 
to hedge these revenues against future movements in exchange rates  we purchase foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are then offset by gains or losses on the underlying revenue exposure and consequently a sudden or significant change of foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on net income or cash flows to the extent future revenues are protected by forward currency contracts 
these contracts  however  typically have a six month duration 
thus  yen dollar fluctuations lasting more than six months will have an impact on our revenues 
during  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the normal course of business to manage our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and costs associated with financial and global operating activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes from bankers 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million 
during fiscal  we recognized  of gains on foreign currency exchange contracts which is reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
