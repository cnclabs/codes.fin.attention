the final extent of costs cannot be determined until the results of testing have been completed and accepted by the njdep 
therefore  the amount of additional costs  if any  cannot be fully determined at this time  but management believes that the effect will not be material 
the company believes that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect upon the company s future capital expenditures or competitive position

the sale of the two c aircraft reduced the company s long term debt by  and fixed assets by  and improved its working capital by about  the increased sales of aviation fuel in were due primarily to increased fuel volume sold 
ronson aviation s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in as compared to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage in was primarily due to the change in mix of products sold

these costs will be incurred over an extended number of years 
in calculating and accruing these costs  the company has discounted the costs to the present value
