item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company analyzes the major elements of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information incorporated by reference 
management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses 
during the periods indicated  the company completed seven acquisitions of bank holding companies and or banks in merger transactions that were accounted for using either the purchase method of accounting or the pooling of interests method of accounting 
with respect to the five mergers completed during the reported periods which were accounted for using the pooling of interests method  all financial data relating to such entities to the respective mergers have been restated to include the merged entities balance sheet data and historical results of operations 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million or 
per diluted share 
included in this amount is million in after tax charges relating to the acquisitions of caminoreal bancshares  inc  lone star bancorporation  inc 
and community bancshares  inc excluding the acquisition charges  operating income for was million or

per diluted share earned in net income of million in increased million  or over the million recorded for diluted earnings per share for was 
as compared to 
for all per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock splits effected as stock dividends through september  two industry measures of the performance by a banking institution are its return on average assets and return on average equity 
return on average assets roa measures net earnings in relation to average total assets and indicates a company s ability to employ its resources profitably 
during  the company s roa was  as compared to and for and  respectively 
during  the company s return on equity was compared to and for and  respectively 
net interest income and net interest margin net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is the principal source of the company s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
net interest income for was million  up million or from million for the growth in net interest income is primarily attributable to the increase in average loans 
the loan growth related to the caminoreal bancshares and community bancshares acquisitions was 
since the lone star bancorporation acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests accounting method  the financial data was restated to include lone star bancorporation s balance sheet data and historical results of operations and there is no loan growth separately attributable to the acquisition of lone star bancorporation 
average earning assets increased from to during the latter part of  the bank deleveraged its balance sheet resulting in a decrease in average securities of from to the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points from in to in additionally during  the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve increased the discount rate a total of basis points whereas in  the federal reserve decreased the discount rate times for a total of basis points 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from in to in this decrease in rates was due to a combination of the federal reserve rate decreases as well as the deleverageing of the balance sheet 
for  the tax equivalent net interest margin net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets increased basis points to from for net interest income for was million  compared to million for  an increase of million or  primarily due to a increase in average earning assets 
during  the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from in to in throughout the second half of and the first half of  the federal reserve system increased the discount rate six times 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from in to in this increase was due to the federal reserve rate increases as well as new fhlb advances resulting from the leveraging program initiated in by the bank 
for  the tax equivalent net interest margin net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets decreased basis points to from for also of note  during the third quarter of  the bank initiated a temporary leveraging strategy in order to enhance earnings by better utilizing current levels of capital 
prior to the commencement of this leverage program  the bank s balance sheet was asset sensitive 
this leveraging was achieved by borrowing funds primarily short term fhlb advances and investing these funds in fixed and variable rate mortgage backed securities and variable rate collateralized mortgage obligations 
the spread on these assets over the cost of borrowed funds averaged basis points 
the leverage program  taken alone  creates an interest rate mismatch 
however  taken together with the core assets and liabilities of the bank  the leverage program serves to mitigate the interest rate risk of the bank

these fees aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
related loan origination costs are not separately allocated to loans  but are charged to non interest expense 
for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets 
in order to make pretax income and resultant yields on tax exempt investments and loans comparable to those on taxable investments and loans  a tax equivalent adjustment is made equally to interest income and income tax expense with no effect on after tax income 
the tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of

typically  the bank s customers have financing requirements between  and  although the bank s legal lending limit was million at december   the bank has not maintained an exposure greater than million on any single relationship 
the bank makes commercial loans primarily to small and medium sized businesses and to professionals 
the bank offers a variety of commercial loan products including revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  working capital loans  and loans to finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
typically  the bank s commercial loans have floating rates of interest  are for varying terms generally not exceeding three years  are personally guaranteed by the business owner and are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or other business assets 
in addition to the commercial loans secured solely by non real estate business assets  the bank makes commercial loans that are secured by owner occupied real estate  as well as other business assets 
the bank s commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate  typically have floating interest rates  and are amortized over a year period with balloon payments due at the end of three years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals  and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
the bank makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a lesser extent  nonresidential properties  such as churches 
generally  construction loans are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates 
the bank conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an architect or other agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the bank s construction lending activities 
the bank makes automobile  boat  home improvement and other loans to consumers 
these loans are primarily made to customers who have other relationships with the bank 
during the first quarter of  the bank sold its credit card portfolio to a correspondent bank 
the bank seeks to compete effectively in its chosen markets by consistent application of its business strategy 
see further discussion of business business banking strategy and business competition 
as of december   there was no concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding of total loans nor were there any loans classified as highly leveraged transactions 
loans held for sale loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase from million at december  the million increase is due to the increase in loans funded by the bank through an intercompany mortgage warehouse with scmc 
mortgage loans originated by scmc are held for sale and are typically sold to investors within one month of origination 
due to the timing of the sales of loans to investors  the balance of these loans at any given time is somewhat volatile 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio  excluding real estate mortgage  consumer and foreign loans and unearned discount at december  risk elements nonperforming  past due  and restructured loans are fully or substantially secured by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for credit losses 
the bank receives  on an ongoing basis  updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses 
the bank defines potential problem loans as those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms 
management identifies these loans through its continuous loan review process and classifies potential problem loans as those loans graded as substandard  doubtful  or loss  excluding all nonperforming loans 
the bank s increase in potential problem loans can be directly attributed to acquisitions  loan growth and economic conditions 
the bank had no material foreign loans outstanding or loan concentrations for the years ended december  through the bank  however  continues to monitor the potential risk of foreign borrowers and concentrations of credit 
the following table presents information regarding non performing loans and assets as of december  through in thousands nonaccrual loans      restructured loans  total nonperforming loans      real estate acquired by foreclosure      other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets potential problem loans      accruing loans past due days or more  total loans      total assets      allowance for credit losses the bank has several systems in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolios 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its bank offices 
the bank also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends and particularly monitors credits which have a total exposure of  or more 
however  there can be no assurance that the bank s loan portfolios will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower creditworthiness due to general economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the industry diversification of the bank s commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
the bank also considers the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the bank continues to monitor the effects of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of non performing loans and related collateral security 
the bank monitors the loan portfolio through its internal loan review department and obtains an annual loan review by independent consultants 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the bank follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the commercial loan portfolio for substantially all commercial loans and real estate loans 
through the loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard accounts but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million of which million were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the bank maintains a separate watch list which further aids the bank in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the bank reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   watch list loans totaled million 
management assigns loan grades by loan and allocations are made within each loan grade so that double allocations are avoided 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs 
the company s board of directors formed a sub committee for asset quality in which meets eight times each year 
that committee is composed of three outside board of directors and five senior management members 
this committee reviews all large loans  past dues  and overdrafts  as well as ratio and trend analysis and approves all charge offs over thousand 
this committee also mandates action items for future meetings to evaluate potential problems and assess the potential need for additional reserve requirements by any particular sector

interest rate sensitivity and liquidity the company manages its interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk to changes in market interest rates 
this process requires a balance between profitability  liquidity  and interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends  and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
when analyzing its gap position  the company emphasizes the next twelve month period 
based on simulation analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  as of december  and as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points  the company is slightly asset sensitive 
the company s analysis indicates that an instantaneous basis point move downward in interest rates would decrease net interest income by and decrease the present value of equity by  likewise  an instantaneous basis point move upward in interest rates would increase net interest income by and increase the present value of equity by 
these sensitivities are all within the threshold set by the company s asset liability committee 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at fiscal year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
the following table sets forth the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  over days days years years years total in thousands  except for data expressed in percentages interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents   securities purchased under agreements to resell   deposits in other financial institutions   trading assets   securities       loans       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities demand and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits      other borrowed funds   notes payable   total interest bearing liabilities      period gap       cumulative gap      period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not reprice proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  the company s management has begun to utilize an interest rate risk simulation model to increase its ability to monitor and forecast the effect of various interest rate environments on earnings and its net capital position 
the objectives of the company s liquidity management is to maintain the bank s ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company strives to manage its liquidity position to allow the bank to meet its requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment expectations of the company s shareholders 
in recent years  the company s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits 
the acquisitions of caminoreal bancshares and community bancshares during resulted in the receipt of an additional in core deposits 
in addition to core deposits  the bank has access to purchased funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios 
the company is a separate and distinct entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity and fund its obligations 
the primary source of the company s revenues are from dividends declared by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
at december   the bank had approximately million in the aggregate available to be paid as dividends to the company 
it is not anticipated that such restrictions will have an impact on the ability of the company to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
as of december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
capital resources at december   shareholders equity totaled million or of total assets  as compared to million and of total assets at december  regulatory authorities in the united states have issued risk based capital standards by which all bank holding companies and banks will be evaluated in terms of capital adequacy 
these guidelines relate a banking company s capital compared to the risk profile of its assets 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity  minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings 
tier capital may be comprised of limited life preferred stock  qualifying debt instruments  and the reserves for credit losses 
in march  the sterling bancshares capital trust ii completed the issuance of  of trust preferred securities and invested the proceeds in the junior subordinated debentures issued by the company 
the proceeds received by the company were used  in part  to fund the acquisition of caminoreal bancshares 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital up to a maximum of of tier capital 
any additional portion of the trust preferred securities would qualify as tier capital 
banking regulators have also issued leverage ratio requirements 
the leverage ratio requirement is measured as the ratio of tier capital to adjusted assets 
see note t to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s and the bank s regulatory capital requirements 
the bank s capital levels at december  and qualify it as well capitalized  the highest of five tiers under applicable regulatory definitions 
risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the provisions of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of some of the statements and information contained in this annual report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements discuss future expectations  activities or events and by their nature  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we will not update these forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made 
many possible factors could affect our future financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in any forward looking statement 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in forward looking statements include 
general business and economic conditions in the markets we serve may be less favorable than anticipated which could decrease the demand for loan  deposit and other financial services and increase loan delinquencies and defaults  
changes in market rates and prices may adversely impact the value of securities  loans  deposits and other financial instruments  
our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes in our assets and liabilities  
legislative or regulatory developments including changes in laws concerning taxes  banking  securities  insurance and other aspects of the financial securities industry  
competitive factors  including product and pricing pressures among financial services organizations  may increase  and 
fiscal and governmental policies of the united states federal government 
with this in mind  you should consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the houston metropolitan area 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the houston metropolitan area 
we also provide  to a lesser extent  banking and financial services to customers in the san antonio and dallas metropolitan areas 
the local economic conditions of houston  and to a lesser extent  san antonio and dallas  have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control will impact these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
in addition  since houston remains largely dependent on the energy industry  a downturn in the energy industry and energy related businesses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on an owner operated business market 
we target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial needs of owner operated businesses with credit needs of up to million 
these owner operated businesses represent a major sector of the houston and national economies 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the houston metropolitan area or the other texas markets in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
we may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those or our management 
any increase in our loan allowance or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
we are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by the following factors 
inflation  
recession  
a rise in unemployment  
tightening money supply  and 
international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
our asset liability management strategy  which is designed to control our risk from changes in market interest rates  may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  savings banks  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to achieve our growth  we have initiated internal growth programs  completed various acquisitions and opened additional offices in the past few years 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow at all 
we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition 
various factors  such as economic conditions and competition  may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices 
further  our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may adversely affect our internal growth 
a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions  and once complete  may not be able to integrate our acquisitions successfully 
our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to acquire other financial institutions 
we may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and  if completed  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  management  products and services of the entities we acquire 
following each acquisition  we must expend substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources to integrate these entities 
in particular  we may be required to install and standardize adequate operational and control systems  deploy or modify equipment  implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and employ and maintain qualified personnel 
our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our subsidiary  sterling bank  and its operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us
