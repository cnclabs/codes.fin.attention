item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements 
general we have incurred net losses in three of the last four years and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas and the volumes of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce 
natural gas and crude oil prices weakened during crude oil and natural gas prices increased somewhat in and increased substantially in during crude oil and natural gas prices weakened substantially from the levels 
in addition  because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced  unless we are successful in acquiring properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation  exploration and development projects 
if crude oil and natural gas prices return to the depressed levels experienced in the last six months of  or if our production levels decrease  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
results of operations our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations o the sales prices of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the level of total sales volumes of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the ability to raise capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  o the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and o the level and success of exploration and development activity 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in the first quarter of  we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices  resulting in lower revenues and net losses during this period 
however  in the summer of and continuing through and early in  prices improved 
for the months of january through july  we had certain crude oil and natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of this price environment 
in january  the market price of natural gas was at its highest level in our operating history and the price of crude oil was also at a high level 
however  over the course of  prices again became depressed  primarily due to the economic downturn 
the table below illustrates how natural gas prices fluctuated over the course of index represents the last three days average of nymex traded contracts index price 
the price is the natural gas price realized by the company during the quarter  and it includes the impact of our hedging activities 
in per mcf natural gas prices by quarter quarter ended march june september december index prices have improved since december  the nymex natural gas price on march  was per mcf 
prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market fell throughout the table below contains the last three days average of nymex traded contracts index price index and the prices realized by the company during the quarter for in per bbl crude oil prices by quarter quarter ended march june september december index prices have improved since december  the nymex crude oil price on march  was per bbl 
hedging activities 
our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in november  we assumed hedge agreements extending through october with a counterparty involving various quantities and fixed prices 
these hedge agreements provided that we make payments to the counterparty to the extent the market prices  determined based on the price for crude oil on the nymex and the inside ferc  tennessee gas pipeline co 
texas zone o price for natural gas  exceeded certain fixed prices and for the counterparty to make payments to us to the extent the market prices were less than such fixed prices 
we accounted for the related gains or losses in crude oil and natural gas revenue in the period of the hedged production 
we terminated these hedge agreements in january and were paid  by the counterparty for such termination 
this amount is included in other income in the accompanying financial statements 
in march  we entered into a costless collar hedge agreement with enron capital and trade resources corp 
for  bbls of crude oil per day with a floor price of per bbl and a ceiling price of per bbl for crude oil on the nymex 
the agreement was effective april  and extended through march  under the terms of the agreement  we were paid when the average monthly price for crude oil on the nymex is below the floor price and paid the counterparty when the average monthly price exceeded the ceiling price 
during the year ended december   we realized a loss of million on this agreement  which is accounted for in crude oil and natural gas revenue 
we also entered into a hedge agreement with barrett resources corporation barrett for the period november through october this agreement was for  bbls per day with us being paid and an additional  barrels per day with a floor price of per barrel and a ceiling of per bbl 
we realized losses from hedges of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively  which is accounted for in crude oil and natural gas revenue 
at year end  barrett had a swap call on either  bbls of crude oil or  mmbtu of natural gas per day at barrett s option at fixed prices for crude oil or to for natural gas through october  as of december   the fair market value of the remaining fixed price hedge agreement was a liability of approximately  which is expected to be charged to revenues in selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per unit data operating revenue crude oil sales    ngls sales    natural gas sales    gas processing revenue    other   total operating revenue    operating income loss    crude oil production mbbls ngls production mbbls natural gas production mmcf    average crude oil sales price per bbl average ngls sales price per bbl average natural gas sales price per mcf revenue and average sales prices are net of hedging activities 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales increased by  from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commodity prices offset by a decline in production volumes 
increased prices contributed million in additional revenue  which was offset by million due to a decrease in production volumes 
the decline in production was due to the disposition of certain properties  primarily in canada  natural field declines and our inability to replace the production represented by the properties we have sold with new production from the producing properties we invested in with the proceeds of our property sales 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in production declines were primarily attributable to our disposition of assets during and our inability to replace the production represented by the properties we have sold with new production from the producing properties we invested in with the proceeds of our property sales 
average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
we also had natural gas processing revenue of million in as compared to million in the decline in processing revenue is due to a decrease in third party natural gas being processed 
we are utilizing more of the plant capacity to process our own natural gas  leaving less capacity for third party processing 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense loe and natural gas processing costs decreased slightly from million in to million in loe on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in the per mcfe cost is due to a decline in production volumes 
g a expense 
general and administrative g a expense decreased from million in to million in the decline in g a expenses is primarily due to our efforts to control cost 
our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due primarily to lower production volumes in as compared to g a stock based compensation expense 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb under the interpretation  certain modifications to fixed stock option awards which were made subsequent to december   and not exercised prior to july   require that the awards be subject to variable accounting until they are exercised  forfeited  or expired 
in march  we amended the exercise price to on all options with an existing exercise price greater than 
we charged approximately million to stock based compensation expense in compared to crediting approximately million in this was due to the decline in the market price of our common stock during dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased by million from million in to million in our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the decline in dd a is due to reductions in our full cost pool resulting from ceiling test write downs in prior years  as well as lower production volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  from million to million for compared to this increase resulted from an increase in debt levels during compared to the increase in our debt level was the result of additional sales pursuant to our production payment arrangement with mirant americas  as well as additional funding from the grey wolf facility 
ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes the cost to acquire  explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties less related deferred taxes  are limited by country  to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  the company is subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of the company s stockholders equity 
the cost ceiling represents the present value discounted at of net cash flows from sales of future production  using commodity prices on the last day of the quarter  or alternatively  if prices subsequent to that date have increased  a price near the periodic filing date of the company s financial statements 
as of december   the company s net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of its estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
the company did not adjust its capitalized costs for its us properties because subsequent to december   crude oil and natural gas prices increased such that capitalized costs for its us properties did not exceed the present value of the estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves for its us properties as determined using increased realized prices on march  of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas 
the company also used the subsequent prices to evaluate its canadian properties  and reduced the year end write down to an amount of million on those properties 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas assets increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved resources are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required

minority interest 
we owned a interest in the earnings of grey wolf through august the consolidated financial statements include the results of grey wolf 
the net income attributable to the minority interest in grey wolf through august increased to million in from million in this increase is due to improved profitability of grey wolf as a result of improved commodity prices received in as compared to as of december   we owned of the outstanding capital stock of grey wolf 
we obtained the additional interest in grey wolf pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent compulsory merger  completed in september income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit relating to the ceiling limitation write down relating to canadian producing properties in other 
in march  abraxas wamsutter lp partnership sold all of its interest in its crude oil and natural gas properties to a third party 
prior to the sale of these properties  effective january   the company s equity investee share of crude oil and natural gas property cost  results of operations and amortization were not material to consolidated operations or financial position 
as a result of the sale  the company received approximately million  which represented a proportional interest in the partnership s proved properties 
in june  we retired million of the old notes and million of the second lien notes at a discount of million 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commodity prices 
increased prices contributed million in additional revenue  which was offset by million due to a decrease in production volumes 
the decline in production was due to the disposition of certain properties  primarily in canada 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in production declines were primarily attributable to our disposition of assets during average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging losses were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
we also had natural gas processing revenue of million in as compared to million in the decline in processing revenue is due to a decrease in third party natural gas being processed 
we are utilizing more of the plant capacity to process our own natural gas  leaving less capacity for third party processing 
lease operating expense 
loe and natural gas processing costs increased by million from million for to million for loe on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase was due primarily to a general increase in the cost of services and increased production taxes due to higher commodity prices in as compared to the increase in the per mcfe cost is due to a decline in production volumes 
g a expense 
g a expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in g a was due to the loss of approximately  of overhead billed to the partnership  substantially all of the assets of which were sold in march  and an increase in director compensation as a result of our restructuring in the fourth quarter of our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due partly to lower production volumes in as compared to as well as the increase in expense in as compared to g a stock based compensation expense

we recognized approximately million as stock based compensation expense during related to these repricings 
dd a expense 
dd a expense increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in dd a is the result of higher finding costs for interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million from million to million for the year ended december  compared to this decrease resulted from reduced debt levels during compared to the reduced debt level was the result of the exchange of approximately million principal amount of our old notes for approximately million principal of our second lien notes  shares of our common stock and contingent value rights

minority interest 
minority interest in the net income of grey wolf  our owned subsidiary during and  increased to million in from  in this increase was due to improved profitability of grey wolf as a result of improved commodity prices received in as compared to income taxes 
income tax expense benefit increased from a benefit of million for the year ended december  to expense of million for the year ended december  the benefit for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the ceiling limitation write down that occurred in that year 
other 
in march  the partnership sold all of its interest in its crude oil and natural gas properties to a third party 
prior to the sale of these properties  effective january   the company s equity investee share of crude oil and natural gas property cost  results of operations and amortization were not material to consolidated operations or financial position 
as a result of the sale  the company received approximately million  which represented a proportional interest in the partnership s proved properties 
in june  we retired million of the old notes and million of the second lien notes at a discount of million 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs o the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  o acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  and o production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to service our existing debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our lack of liquidity and high debt levels have had a substantial impact on our ability to develop existing properties and acquire new producing properties 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  the sale of properties and financing activities  including sales of production payments to mirant americas and funding from the grey wolf facility with mirant canada 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
significant down turns in commodity prices  such as that experienced in and the last six months of  can reduce our cash from operating activities 
although we have hedged a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production and may continue this practice  future crude oil and natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
prices for natural gas and crude oil have increased substantially since december   however  we cannot assure you that these prices can be sustained in the future 
for more detailed descriptions of commodity prices  you should read the discussion under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
as of december   the company s net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of its estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
the company did not adjust its capitalized costs for its us properties because subsequent to december   crude oil and natural gas prices increased such that capitalized costs for its us properties did not exceed the present value of the estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves for its us properties as determined using increased realized prices on march  of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas 
the company also used the subsequent prices to evaluate its canadian properties  and reduced the year end write down to an amount of million on those properties 
furthermore  low crude oil and natural gas prices could affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us 
similarly  our cash flow from operations will decrease if the volume of crude oil and natural gas produced by us decreases 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
in addition  we have sold  and intend to continue to sell  certain of our properties 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
while we have had some success in pursuing these activities  we have not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
working capital 
at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
the majority of our current liabilities at december   were trade accounts payable of million  revenues due third parties of million and accrued interest of million 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the timing of our interest payments of approximately million each march  million each may  million each september  and million each november as a result of these periodic interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations  our cash balances will decrease dramatically on certain dates during the year 
we will need additional funds in the future for both the development of our assets and the service of our debt  including the repayment of the million in principal amount of the first lien notes maturing in march and the million of the second lien notes and old notes maturing in november in order to meet the goals of developing our assets and servicing our debt obligations  we will be required to obtain additional sources of capital and or reduce or reschedule our existing cash requirements 
in order to do so  we may pursue one or more of the following alternatives o refinancing existing debt  o repaying debt with proceeds from the sale of assets  o exchanging debt for equity  o managing the timing and reducing the scope of our capital expenditures  o issuing debt or equity securities or otherwise raising additional funds  or o selling all or a portion of our existing assets  including interests in our assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the above alternatives  or some combination thereof  will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures on a historical basis for the three years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category property acquisitions   development    facilities and other   total    during and  expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
in  expenditures were primarily the acquisition of new cache petroleums  ltd 
these expenditures were funded through internally generated cash flow  the issuance of million of the first lien notes  borrowings under a credit facility and the sale of assets 
as cash flow permits our current budget for capital expenditures for other than acquisition expenditures is million  approximately million of which has been spent as of march  the remaining portion of such expenditures is largely discretionary and will be made primarily for the development of existing properties 
additional capital expenditures may be made for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but we currently have no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a further reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we will not be able to offset crude oil and natural gas production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    total    operating activities for the year ended december   provided us million of cash 
investing activities used million during our investing activities included the sale of properties which provided million  and the use of million primarily for the development of producing properties 
financing activities provided million during  including the provision of additional funding of million under our production payment arrangement with mirant americas  and the provision of million under the grey wolf facility 
payments on long term debt used million 
operating activities for the year ended december   provided us million of cash 
investing activities used million during comprised of million provided from the sale of an equity investment in wamsutter holdings lp  million provided from the sale of properties and million used primarily for the acquisition and development of producing properties 
financing activities used million during operating activities for the year ended december   provided us million of cash 
investing activities used million during  comprised of million provided from the sale of crude oil and natural gas producing properties and million used primarily for the acquisition and development of producing properties 
financing activities provided million during current liquidity needs 
for several years  we have sought to improve our liquidity in order to allow us to meet our debt service requirements and to maintain and increase existing production 
our sale in march of our first lien notes allowed us to refinance our bank debt  meet our near term debt service requirements and make limited crude oil and natural gas capital expenditures 
in october  we sold a dollar denominated production payment for million relating to existing natural gas wells in south texas to a unit of southern energy  inc which is now known as mirant americas energy capital  lp and in and  we sold additional production payments for million and million  respectively  relating to additional natural gas wells in the edwards trend to mirant americas 
we have the ability to sell up to million to mirant for drilling opportunities in south texas 
in december  abraxas and canadian abraxas  completed an exchange offer whereby we exchanged our new senior secured notes due the second lien notes  common stock and contingent value rights for approximately of our outstanding senior notes due  series d the old notes 
the exchange offer reduced our long term debt by approximately million after expenses 
in march  we sold our interest in certain crude oil and natural gas properties that we owned and operated in wyoming 
simultaneously  a limited partnership of which one of our subsidiaries was the general partner  accounted for on the equity method of accounting sold its interest in crude oil and natural gas properties in the same area 
our net proceeds from these transactions were approximately million 
during  we sold assets in the united states and canada 
our net proceeds from these transactions were approximately million 
these proceeds were used to invest in additional producing properties 
in december  grey wolf entered into a financing agreement with mirant canada for cdn million approximately us million  which is non recourse to abraxas 
initial borrowings from this facility of approximately us million were used to retire grey wolf s existing bank facility and for general corporate purposes 
up to us million is available to finance drilling of wells and related activities under this credit facility 
for more information regarding our liquidity needs  you should also read business recent events 
future capital resources 
we will have four principal sources of liquidity going forward i cash on hand  ii cash flow from operations  iii the production payment with mirant americas and iv sales of properties 
in addition  grey wolf has additional borrowing capacity under its credit facility with mirant canada 
the terms of the first lien notes indenture  the second lien notes indenture and the old notes indenture substantially limit our use of proceeds from sales of properties 
the first lien notes indenture and the second lien notes indenture restrict  among other things  our ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o incur liens  o pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  o consummate certain asset sales  o enter into certain transactions with affiliates  o merge or consolidate with any other person  or o sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
furthermore  our ability to raise funds through additional indebtedness will be limited because a large portion of our crude oil and natural gas properties and natural gas processing facilities are subject to a first lien or floating charge for the benefit of the holders of the first lien notes and a second lien or floating charge for the benefit of the holders of the second lien notes 
finally  our indentures also place restrictions on the use of proceeds from asset sales 
proceeds from asset sales must generally be used for investments in producing properties or related assets 
in addition  the indenture for the second lien notes permits using proceeds to make payments under the first lien notes 
in the event that such proceeds are not used in this manner  we must make an offer to note holders to purchase notes at of the principal amount 
such an offer must be made within days of a property sale 
if commodity prices remain at  or fall below their current levels  it will be necessary for us to delay discretionary capital expenditures and seek alternative sources of capital in order to maintain liquidity 
due to our current debt levels and the restrictions contained in the indentures described above  our best opportunity for additional sources of capital will be through the disposition of assets and some of the other alternatives discussed above 
for more information regarding our liquidity needs  you should also read business recent events 
although there may be questions regarding our viability as a going concern  management believes that the successful disposition of certain assets will allow us to meet our liquidity needs for the next year  including the repayment of the million in principal amount of the first lien notes maturing in march we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any of our efforts to improve liquidity or that such efforts will produce enough cash to fund our operating and capital requirements  make our interest payments or to make the principal payments due on our first lien notes  old notes and second lien notes 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements o long term debt o operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in and contractual obligations total after dollars in thousands long term debt     operating leases  includes million of the first lien notes  million of the old notes and second lien notes  million under the grey wolf facility and million under the production payment with mirant americas 
mirant americas is paid a percentage of revenue from south texas wells on which they have advanced production payments  the amount of the future payments is dependent on production from the subject wells 
as a result  no payments are reflected in the table 
the grey wolf facility does not have scheduled repayments of principal prior to its maturing in instead  grey wolf is required to pay its net cash flow on a monthly basis to mirant canada 
we have included the entire amount outstanding under the grey wolf facility at december  million although we will be making payments prior to for more information on the grey wolf facility  you should read the description under grey wolf facility 
office lease obligations 
other obligations we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments to mirant americas and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion 
as cash flow permits our capital expenditure budget for for existing operations and leaseholds is approximately million 
long term indebtedness old notes 
on november   abraxas and canadian abraxas consummated the offering of million of their senior notes due  series a  which were exchanged for series b notes in february on january   abraxas and canadian abraxas completed the sale of million of the series c notes 
the series b notes and the series c notes were subsequently exchanged for million in principal amount of the old notes in june interest on the old notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year at the rate of per annum 
the old notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of abraxas and canadian abraxas  on or after november   at the redemption prices set forth below  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption  if redeemed during the month period commencing on november of the years set forth below year percentage and thereafter the old notes are joint and several obligations of abraxas and canadian abraxas and rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of abraxas and canadian abraxas 
the old notes rank senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of abraxas and canadian abraxas 
the old notes are  however  effectively subordinated to the first lien notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the first lien notes and the second lien notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the second lien notes 
the old notes are unconditionally guaranteed  on a senior basis by a wholly owned abraxas subsidiary  sandia oil gas corporation 
the guarantee is a general unsecured obligation of sandia and ranks pari passu in right of payment to all unsubordinated indebtedness of sandia and senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of sandia 
the guarantee is effectively subordinated to the first lien notes and the second lien notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing these obligations 
upon a change of control  as defined in the old notes indenture  each holder of the old notes will have the right to require abraxas and canadian abraxas to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s old notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase

net operating loss carryforwards at december  the company had  subject to the limitation discussed below   of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire from through if not utilized 
at december   the company had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for canadian tax purposes 
these carryforwards will expire from through if not utilized 
as a result of the acquisition of certain partnership interests and crude oil and natural gas properties in and  an ownership change under section occurred in december accordingly  it is expected that the use of the us net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to december  of  will be limited to approximately  per year 
during  the company acquired of the common stock of an unrelated corporation 
the use of net operating loss carryforwards of the acquired corporation of  acquired in the acquisition are limited to approximately  per year 
as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock for acquisitions and sales of common stock  an additional ownership change under section occurred in october accordingly  it is expected that the use of all us net operating loss carryforwards generated through october including those subject to the and ownership changes discussed above of  will be limited as described above and in the following paragraph 
an ownership change under section occurred in december  following the issuance of additional shares  as described in note it is expected that the annual use of us net operating loss carryforwards subject to this section limitation will be limited to approximately  subject to the lower limitations described above 
future changes in ownership may further limit the use of the company s carryforwards 
in assets with built in gains were sold  increasing the section limitation for by approximately the annual section limitation may be increased during any year  within years of a change in ownership  in which built in gains that existed on the date of the change in ownership are recognized 
in addition to the section limitations  uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company has established a valuation allowance of  and  for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
abraxas has chosen to follow the full cost method 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that this method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
the company has experienced this situation several times over the years and experienced it again in our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under the full cost method of accounting  we record the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties  and capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas properties 
the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties less related deferred taxes  is limited by country  to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  we are subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of our stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas assets increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of million  related to our canadian proved reserves 
the write down in was due to low commodity prices 
for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of million  related to our canadian properties 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
should commodity prices decline  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hedge accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for the company on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive income oci and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value will we recognized in earnings 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period 
the amortization provisions apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the company has applied these standards to its purchase of the minority interest of grey wolf 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires an asset retirement obligation to be recorded at fair value during the period incurred and an equal amount recorded as an increase in the value of the related long lived asset 
the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset and the obligation is accreted to its present value each period 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning january  with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its future results of operations and financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
retains the requirement to recognize an impairment loss only where the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and to measure such loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
 among other things  changes the criteria that have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale and requires that operating losses from the discontinued operations be recognized in the period that the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning january  with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its future results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent crude oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
we attempt to manage the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices through the periodic use of commodity price hedging agreements 
we covered approximately of our production in with hedge agreements 
without those arrangements  our realized natural gas prices would have been per mcf higher in you should read the discussion under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding our hedging activities and impact of commodity price changes 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices would have reduced our operating revenue  cash flow and net income by approximately million for the year 
see part i  item  business recent events 
hedging sensitivity the fair value of our remaining hedge instrument was determined based on nymex forward price quotes as of december  as of december   a commodity price increase of would have resulted in an unfavorable change in the fair market value of our hedging instrument of million and a commodity price decrease of would have resulted in a favorable change in the fair value of our hedge instrument of  the following table sets forth our hedge position as of december  time period notional quantities price fair value january  october   mcf day of natural fixed price swap  gas or  bbl day of natural gas or crude oil crude oil interest rate risk at december   substantially all of abraxas long term debt was at fixed interest rates from to and not subject to fluctuations in market rates and grey wolf s long term debt was at a fixed interest rate of foreign currency our canadian operations are measured in the local currency of canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets 
canadian operations reported a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the canadian dollar would have changed our net income by approximately  we do not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
