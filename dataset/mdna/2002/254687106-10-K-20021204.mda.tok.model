increases at the cable networks were driven by higher affiliate revenues reflecting higher rates at espn and subscriber growth at both espn and the international disney channels  partially offset by lower advertising revenues due to the soft advertising market and lower revenues from adelphia communications company adelphia in the united states and kirchmedia company kirch in germany as a result of their financial difficulties

the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
we have implemented a variety of strategies  including marketing efforts  to reduce the impact of the higher costs 
the impact of these contracts on the company s results over the remaining term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences 
the costs of these contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues over the remaining contract period 
the company s contract to broadcast the nfl is for an eight year term commencing with the season 
the initial five year period is non cancelable with the remaining three years renewable at the option of the nfl 
programming rights costs for the initial five year period have been charged to expense based upon the ratio of current period s gross revenues to estimated total revenues for this period of time 
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly and  accordingly  they are reviewed periodically and amortization and carrying amounts are adjusted  if necessary 
such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods

over the past year  significant changes have occurred in the commercial insurance market which are impacting the cost and availability of the company s insurance coverage 
the company has successfully renewed all of our significant policies in this current fiscal year  though the premiums and deductibles have increased 
during the third quarter of the current year  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company to insure certain components of loss exposure which were previously insured by third party insurance companies 
accordingly  the company s risk of loss has increased 
as disclosed in the notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
management believes that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact  if any  that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on the company s financial position or cash flows 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s investment portfolio includes commercial aircraft leveraged lease investments made between and totaling million  which are diversified across three air carriers united airlines million  delta airlines million  and fedex million and eleven aircraft 
risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to the ability of the air carriers to make underlying lease payments 
we continue to monitor our investment in commercial aircraft leasing transactions given the current status of the airline industry 
we have  in particular  been monitoring united airlines  which has indicated that if it does not obtain significant concessions from each of its employee unions  
table of contents achieve cost savings in other operating areas of the company and obtain a loan guarantee from the airline transportation stabilization board  it will have to file for bankruptcy protection 
to date  all payments on these leases have been made when due 
the inability of any of the companies to make their lease payments or the termination of our leases through a bankruptcy proceeding could result in material charges related to a write down of some or all of our investment and could accelerate income tax payments 
the company believes that its financial condition is strong and that its cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
in addition to macroeconomic factors  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which are based  in significant part  on the company s performance as measured by certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
on october   standard poor s ratings services lowered its long term ratings on the company to bbb from a and removed the company s ratings from creditwatch where they were placed with negative implications on august  at the same time  the a short term corporate credit rating  which was not on creditwatch  was affirmed 
the current outlook is stable 
on october   moody s investors service downgraded the company s long term debt rating to baa from a  concluding the review for possible downgrade that commenced on august  the company s short term rating of p was affirmed and the outlook is stable 
other matters accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
film and television revenues and costs we expense the cost of film and television production and participations as well as multi year sports rights over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues 
these estimates are calculated on an individual production basis for film and television and on an individual contract basis for sports rights 
estimates of total gross revenues can change due to a variety of factors  including the level of market acceptance  advertising rates and subscriber fees 
television network and station rights for theatrical movies  series and other programs are charged to expense based on the number of times the program is expected to be shown 
estimates of usage of television network and station programming can change based on competition and audience acceptance 
accordingly  revenue estimates and planned usage are reviewed periodically and are revised if necessary 
a change in revenue projections or planned usage could have an impact on our results of operations 
costs of film and television productions and programming costs are subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to the applicable accounting rules 
the values of the television program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology 
the company s dayparts are early morning  daytime  late night  prime time  news  children and sports 
a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type 
estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market 
table of contents conditions are less favorable than our projections  potentially significant film  television or programming cost write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments  which are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies 
we record reductions to revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise  primarily home video  dvd and software products  and for customer programs and sales incentives 
these estimates are based upon historical return experience  current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products

goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments effective october   we adopted sfas  as described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment within six months of the date of adoption and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the first half of the current fiscal year  we completed our impairment testing and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
on october   we updated our impairment test and determined that there was no impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long lived assets include certain long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the companies we invest in  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees 
if these forecasts are not met  impairment charges may be required 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims

it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

item a 
market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities in the same principal currencies 
the principal currencies hedged are european euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
in addition  we use various financial instruments to minimize the exposure to changes in fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and qualifying equity sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding 
table of contents quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year 
the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and qualifying equity investments 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in currency values 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company s financial instruments at september  and the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  is as follows unaudited  in millions interest rate currency sensitive sensitive equity sensitive financial financial financial combined instruments instruments instruments portfolio var as of september  average var during the year ended september  highest var during the year ended september  lowest var during the year ended september
