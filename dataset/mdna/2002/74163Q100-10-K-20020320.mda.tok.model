we believe that international revenue  as a percentage of our total revenue  will continue to fluctuate in the future 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of the joint venture nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide any funding 
the primus software suite consists of primus eserver  primus esupport  primus answer engine and primus interchange 
product license revenues and related services from primus eserver and primus esupport products accounted for over of total revenues for the three year period ended december   and we expect these products to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for as a result  factors adversely affecting the demand for these products and our products in general  such as competition  pricing or technological change  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
our future financial performance will substantially depend on our ability to sell current versions of our entire suite of products  including products based on the technology acquired from answerlogic  and our ability to develop and sell enhanced versions of our products 
to help us execute our long term growth strategy  we have invested heavily in product development and in building our sales  marketing  finance  administrative and professional services organizations 
we have incurred quarterly net losses since inception  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in product development  sales and marketing  finance  administration and professional services 
history of operations primus  formerly named symbologic corporation  was incorporated in october and initially focused on a software development tool for creation of systems to gather organizational expertise 
in  we licensed that product line to another company and founded the customer support consortium  a consortium of leading software and hardware companies focused on advancing customer support strategies  models and standards 
from to  we directed our attention to customer support products and began developing our solutionseries products 
in  we changed our name to primus knowledge solutions  inc and released solutionbuilder r  our first solutionseries product 
we launched our first web based products  solutionpublisher r and solutionexplorer r  in and  respectively 
in  we also divested our interest in the customer support consortium in conjunction with its transition to an independent nonprofit entity 
also in  primus kk became a reseller of the company s products and a provider of support services in japan 
we completed our initial public offering on june   offering  shares of primus common stock  at an aggregate offering price of approximately million 
net proceeds after accounting for million in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately million in other expenses were million 
acquisitions and restructuring on december   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with a california corporation  imparto software corporation imparto  a privately held software company and developer of emarketing software 
in connection with the transaction  we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of preferred stock  preferred stock warrants  and common stock of imparto  and we converted all outstanding options to purchase imparto common stock into options to purchase up to  shares of primus common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of imparto 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures and  as a result  do not necessarily reflect the cost structure of the newly combined entity 
during  we discontinued funding product development for imparto  a wholly owned subsidiary 
on january   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated january   we acquired ownership of order 
com  inc order  a privately held software company  which developed and marketed software that acts as a personal sales assistant  helping buyers define requirements and configure custom solutions 
order was incorporated in georgia in under the name business systems design  inc as a result of the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock  
par value per share  in exchange for all issued and outstanding capital stock and assumed all outstanding options and warrants of order  which represents  on a converted basis   shares of primus common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests business combination  and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of order 
the historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their actual operating cost structures and  as a result  do not necessarily reflect the cost structure of the newly combined entity 
on may   we acquired answerlogic  inc answerlogic 
answerlogic s technology provided us with natural language capabilities that were a logical extension to our product suite 
these new capabilities allowed our customers to provide direct answers to customer questions from unstructured data sources html  pdf and text formats as well as structured information contained in the primus knowledgebase 
we have accounted for the answerlogic business combination using the purchase method and has included answerlogic s operating results in its consolidated operating results since june  during the third quarter of  we discontinued funding product development for order  a wholly owned subsidiary 
on september   order sold substantially all of its assets to its leading reseller 
as a result of this transaction  our reseller rights for the esales product line were cancelled 
the gain on the disposal of substantially all of the order assets was recorded as an extraordinary gain in our consolidated financial statements  since the disposed assets were acquired in an acquisition accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting and were disposed of within two years of the business combination 
during the fourth quarter of  we developed and executed a restructuring plan and as a result incurred charges of approximately million related to the reduction in its workforce and costs associated with certain excess leased facilities and asset impairments 
the charges included approximately  for the assets disposed of or removed from operations  which consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  office equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
also included was an expense of approximately million for severance  benefits and related costs due to the reduction in workforce 
we reduced our workforce by people  or of its employee base  in october  and all functional areas were affected by the reductions 
additionally  the charge included an expense of  due to our decision to reduce some facilities 
a portion of this charge is based on current estimated lease rental rates for leases in the respective market 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in this market or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease this facility  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
the  of future cash outlays are anticipated through december unless we are able to negotiate to exit the lease at an earlier date 
as we continue to evaluate our underlying cost structure to improve our operating results and better position ourselves for growth  we may incur further restructuring charges  including severance  benefits and related costs due to a reduction in workforce and charges for assets disposed of or removed from operations as a direct result of a reduction in workforce 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards established for software companies 
these include statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and there is vendor specific objective evidence to allocate the total fee to the elements of the arrangement 
revenue recognized from software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  and consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is typically based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
in multiple element arrangements in which vsoe exists only for undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the vsoe of the undelivered elements is assigned to the delivered elements 
if such evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
previously  for our eserver and esupport products  revenue from software license agreements was recognized over the software core installation period if sold with installation services or upon delivery of software if sold without installation services  provided all of the other revenue recognition requirements of statement of position no 
had been met 
during the fourth quarter of  we released new versions of these software products  which do not require significant installation efforts 
accordingly  revenues from software license arrangements are now generally recognized upon the delivery of the software  regardless of whether installation services are sold  provided all of the other revenue recognition requirements of statement of position no 
have been met 
we believe that this change will not have a material impact on our operating results 
if a customer requires an acceptance period  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
revenues for license arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year are recognized periodically as payments become due  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
services revenue consists of maintenance and support fees and consulting  training and hosting fees 
maintenance and ongoing hosting fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to the use of our software products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fee revenues are recognized separately on delivery of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and the payment terms for licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria 
from time to time we enter into distribution agreements with resellers that typically provide for sublicense fees based on a percentage of list prices 
sublicense fees are generally recognized upon delivery of software if pervasive evidence of an arrangement between the distributor and their customer exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to the elements of the arrangement 
our agreements with our customers and resellers do not contain product return rights 
accounts receivable we perform a quarterly analysis to determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
this analysis includes various analytical procedures and a review of factors  including specific individual balances selected from a cross section of the accounts that comprise total accounts receivable  our history of collections  as well as the overall economic environment 
goodwill in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
the amortization of goodwill ceases upon the required adoption date of the statement  which for calendar year end companies was january  as of january   we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
we believe that a transitional impairment loss as a result of the adoption sfas no 
will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million  as the implied fair value of the goodwill as of the date of adoption was zero 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by each item reflected in our consolidated statements of operations

license revenue 
total license revenue was million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
international license revenue decreased million over the same period 
our international sales constituted of our revenue  of our revenue  and of our revenue 
we believe that international revenue  as a percentage of our total revenue  will continue to fluctuate in the future 
we experienced a decrease in the year on year sales of our software in we believe the weakening of the global economy in and the continued global slow down in information technology spending contributed to this decline 
during the year  the buying patterns of our potential customers were different than in the prior year  and resulted in a longer sales cycle  making it difficult to predict when license sales would close 
license revenue as a percentage of total revenue was and in and  respectively 
software license revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues primarily due to the decrease in our software license revenues  and the growth of our support and maintenance contracts we obtained as our customer base grew 
we believe that the depth and duration of the current economic slowdown will have a material impact on our operating results 
services revenue 
total services revenue was million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  which was the result of an increase in maintenance and support contract revenue of million and a decrease in consulting fees of million over the same period 
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was and in and  respectively 
our growing installed base is the primary driver for the increase in maintenance and support contract revenues  and this coupled with the substantial decrease in license revenues resulted in the significant change in the percentage of revenue generated from licenses and services 
the decrease in consulting fees is a byproduct of the declines in license revenue and information technology spending experienced during the current year 
we expect the amount of and proportion of services revenue to total revenue to fluctuate in the future  depending primarily on the dollar amount of software license sales and our customers use of third party consulting and implementation services providers 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue consists primarily of media  product packaging and shipping  documentation and other production costs  and third party royalties 
cost of license revenue was  and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
this decrease in the cost of license revenue is primarily due to the significant decrease in total revenue from to cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was  during both and we anticipate that our cost of license revenue will vary in absolute dollars and as a percent of license revenue due to increases or decreases in the volume of software product sales  the sales mix and the costs of third party technology integrated with our solutions

cost of services revenue consists primarily of salaries  benefits and allocated overhead costs related to customer support  consulting  training and global services personnel  including the cost of services provided by third party consultants engaged by primus 
cost of services revenue was million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was and  during and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was primarily due to the continued growth of post contract support revenue attributable to the increase in our installed customer base along with the cost savings from fourth quarter workforce reductions of employees  or  within the professional services and customer support organizations 
cost of services revenue will vary depending on the mix of services that we provide between support and maintenance  training  implementation and consulting services  as well as staffing levels  overhead costs and customer needs 
gross profit margins are generally higher for support and maintenance services  which include the delivery of software enhancements and upgrades  than for training  implementation and consulting services 
we anticipate that cost of services revenue will decrease in as compared to  primarily as a result of our fourth quarter restructuring and our continued cost containment efforts 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  commissions and benefits earned by sales and marketing personnel  direct expenditures such as travel  communication and occupancy for direct sales offices and marketing expenditures related to direct mail  online marketing  advertising  trade shows  public relations and new product launches 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease is due to the reduction in the variable component of total compensation related costs ie bonuses  commissions and related payroll taxes which are related to the decrease in revenues for the periods presented  as well as fourth quarter reductions in total sales and marketing workforce of employees  or  travel and entertainment costs  recruiting expenses  and consulting and marketing expenditures eg advertising  public relations  tradeshows and collateral materials as part of our overall cost containment efforts 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue were and in and  respectively 
this increase as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the significant decrease in total revenues from to we believe that a significant sales and marketing effort is essential for us to maintain market position and further increase market acceptance of our products  and we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses as an absolute dollar amount will decrease in as compared to  primarily as a result of our fourth quarter restructuring and our continued cost containment efforts 
in subsequent periods we expect that sales and marketing expense as an absolute dollar amount will fluctuate  depending primarily on the volume of future revenues  staffing levels  overhead costs and our assessment of market opportunities and sales channels 
research and development 
research and development expenses include development costs associated with new products  enhancements and upgrades of existing products and quality assurance activities  and consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and contractors fees for software engineers  program and product managers  technical writers  linguistic specialists and quality assurance personnel 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to the discontinuance of funding for order  current year reductions in the variable component of total compensation related costs  fourth quarter reductions in research and development headcount of employees  or  and the use of third party consultants within our research and development group  partially offset by increases in research and development headcount related to our acquisition of answerlogic 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were and for and  respectively 
this increase as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the significant decrease in total revenues from to we believe that a significant research and development investment is essential for us to maintain our market position  to continue to expand our knowledge application software and to develop additional applications 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to invest in product research and development for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that research and development costs as an absolute dollar amount will decrease in as compared to  primarily as a result of our fourth quarter restructuring and our continued cost containment efforts 
in subsequent periods  we expect that research and development expense as an absolute dollar amount will fluctuate  depending primarily on the volume of future revenues  customer needs  staffing levels  overhead costs and our assessment of market demand 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs for executive  finance  human resource  legal  administrative and information services personnel  occupancy costs  bad debt expense and costs associated with being a public company  including  but not limited to  annual and other public reporting costs  directors and officers liability insurance  investor relations programs and professional services fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease is primarily due to the current year reductions in the variable component of total compensation related costs and fourth quarter reduction in general and administrative headcount of employees  or  travel costs  recruiting expenses and professional service fees  partially offset by increases in facility charges and depreciation expense 
the decrease in total general and administrative expenses reflects the continued impact of the overall cost containment measures taken by us during the current year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in and in this increase as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the significant decrease in total revenues from to the increase of general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue is directly attributable to revenue declining at a much faster pace than general and administrative expenses in the current year 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars in future periods  depending primarily on the volume of future revenues  staffing levels  overhead costs and corporate infrastructure requirements including insurance  professional services  bad debt expense and other administrative costs 
goodwill amortization 
amortization of goodwill was  in and zero in the goodwill amortization expense is a result of the acquisition of answerlogic  which was completed in may and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

the amortization of goodwill ceases upon the required adoption date of the statement  which for calendar year end companies was january  as of january   we have unamortized goodwill of approximately million subject to the transition provisions of sfas no

also included in the charge was approximately million for severance  benefits and related costs due to the reduction in workforce 
we reduced our workforce by people  or of its employee base in october  and all functional areas were affected by the reductions 
the remaining  of the charge is due to our decision to exit and reduce excess facilities 
a portion of the charge is based on the estimated period to sublease the excess space and the current estimated lease rental rates for leases in the respective market 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in this market or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease this facility  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
as we continue to evaluate our underlying cost structure to improve our operating results and better position ourselves for growth  we may incur further restructuring charges  including severance  benefits and related costs due to a reduction in workforce and charges for assets disposed of or removed from operations as a direct result of a reduction in workforce

these costs were recorded in connection with the january order merger and the december imparto merger  both of which were accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
other income  net 
other income decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease from period to period is primarily due to fluctuations in the average combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as well as declining investment yields

this is offset by approximately million for the decrease in accounts receivable and other assets  combined with million in depreciation and amortization and a  loss related to assets disposed of or removed from operations 
investing activities provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities for this period consisted primarily of approximately million in proceeds from the maturity of short term investments and  of proceeds primarily from the sale of order assets offset by approximately million in purchases of short term investments 
further activities included the purchase of approximately million in capital equipment  with the issuance of a  related party note  and cash of  acquired in the answerlogic acquisition 
financing activities used cash of  in and provided cash of million in in and  financing activities for included  in payments made on long term debt assumed in the answerlogic acquisition  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our principal source of liquidity at december  was our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we also have a line of credit totaling million  which is secured by substantially all of our assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus as of december  and expires in december there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with our financial covenants in connection with the line of credit 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we 
enter new markets for our products and services  including through potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  technology or other assets 
increase or decrease research and development spending 
increase or decrease sales and marketing activities 
develop new distribution channels 
improve our operational and financial systems 
broaden our professional services capabilities we continue to focus on maximizing the performance of our core business and controlling costs to respond to the economic environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced worldwide staffing levels by approximately  across the entire business 
in connection with this restructuring  our executive vice president of worldwide sales and marketing  kim nelson  left the company 
additionally  the related restructuring charge included severance  benefits and related costs  costs associated with certain excess leased facilities and asset impairments 
a portion of the restructuring charge is based on current estimated lease rental rates for leases in the respective market 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in this market or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease this facility  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
future cash outlays of approximately  are anticipated through december unless we are able to negotiate to exit the lease at an earlier date 
as we continue to evaluate our underlying cost structure to improve our operating results and better position ourselves for growth  we may incur further restructuring charges 
including severance  benefits and related costs due to a reduction in workforce and charges for assets disposed of or removed from operations as a direct result of a reduction in workforce 
in the near term  we believe our costs and operating expenses  excluding restructuring related charges  will continue to decrease to a level that is closer to our expected revenues while allowing us to continue to invest in accordance with our strategic priorities 
however  we may be unable to achieve these expense reductions without adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we expect to continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our products and services grow 
we lease office space under operating leases with various expiration dates through future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  are as follows operating leases in thousands total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately  on leases due in the future under non cancelable subleases 
rent expense was approximately million net of sublease rental income of  million  and million  for  and  respectively 
we have no material long term commitments or obligations other than those under these leases 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor does it have any commitment or intent to provide any funding to any such entity 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
while we will continue to implement cost containment efforts across our business  our operating expenses  including costs to defend and or settle legal actions that have been or may be brought against us  will consume a material amount of our cash resources 
we believe that the total amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with our commercial credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital or other purposes for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  depending on the development of our business  we will likely require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  unanticipated problems or expenses  opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives we encounter and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt including debt convertible into equity financing or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
our recent history of declining market valuation  volatility in our stock price and doubts surrounding our future eligibility to remain listed on the nasdaq national market could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms 
any financing we obtain may dilute or otherwise impair our current shareholders ownership interest in the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and related change in the market values of our investments and foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
we typically invest our excess cash in high quality corporate and municipal debt instruments 
as a result  our related investment portfolio is exposed to the impact of short term changes in interest rates 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may cause our future investment income to fall short of expectations 
our investment portfolio is designated as available for sale  and accordingly is presented at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
we protect and preserve our invested funds with investment policies and procedures that limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   decreases in interest rates on the fair market value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities caused an insignificant increase in our net loss 
fixed rate short term investments at december  of approximately million had a weighted average interest rate of and are due in we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would be insignificant 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we develop products in the united states and sell them in north america  europe  and  through primus kk  asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are predominantly priced in us dollars and translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we have two foreign subsidiaries primus knowledge solutions uk limited and primus knowledge solutions france whose expenses are incurred in their local currency 
as exchange rates vary  their expenses  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our operating results have not been significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations in and if  during  the us dollar uniformly increases or decreases in strength by relative to the currency of our foreign sales subsidiaries  our operating results for would likely not be significantly affected
