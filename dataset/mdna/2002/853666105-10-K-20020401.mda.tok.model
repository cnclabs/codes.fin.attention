liquidity and capital resources in  cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to cash used in operations of million in and cash provided by operations of million in the improvement is primarily attributable to the company s efforts to reduce inventory levels from their elevated levels of december  this improvement was offset by a reduction in accounts payable and the decrease in earnings 
inventory decreased by million as a result of the company s inventory reduction program  which resulted primarily from reduced production and purchases  and where needed  the temporary closing of manufacturing facilities the reductions have effected both the engine management and temperature control segments 
inventory turnover was x in vs 
x in  on a rolling twelve month basis  reflecting the high inventory levels at december  and should improve as a result of the inventory reduction efforts 
future reductions are planned in  however  such reductions are expected to be more modest than in comparing and  there are two reasons for the increase in inventory levels and the decrease in inventory turns x in vs 
x in 
first  with respect to the temperature control segment  the business is highly seasonal with sales of air conditioning parts being greatest in the second and third quarters of the year 
this seasonality requires the build up of inventory levels prior to the main selling season 
as discussed in our comparison of the year vs 
 temperature control sales were significantly below the prior year and forecasted amounts 
although significant reductions were made to temperature control production levels in  the short fall in net sales more than off set such reductions 
second  with respect to the engine management segment  in the third quarter of  engine management successfully acquired a new major customer which required inventory levels to be increased in order to fill the initial pipeline of orders from such customer 
in addition  the customer launch for new orders was extended into  versus the fourth quarter of  as originally planned 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures and acquisitions 
for the three years ended december    and capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in december  the company signed a letter of intent to acquire carol cable limited  a manufacturer and distributor of wire sets  based in england  for approximately million 
assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase is expected to be completed in april with funds provided under the company s line of credit 
on january   the company purchased the temperature control business of hartle industries for approximately million 
assets acquired consist primarily of property plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase was financed with funds provided under the company s line of credit 
on march  the company reached a definitive agreement to purchase the aftermarket business of sagem inc  a subsidiary of johnson controls  for approximately million 
sagem inc is a basic manufacturer of fuel injectors  a product line which prior to the acquisition  the company has been purchasing 
assets to be acquired consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase which is expected to close within sixty days will be partially financed by the seller approximately million to be paid over a two year period  with the remaining funds being provided under the company s line of credit 
cash used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in the increase in cash used was primarily due to the company s refinancing  as discussed below  offset by the discontinuance of stock repurchases 
dividends paid for the three years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the board of directors increased the regular quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share 
the company  effective april  entered into an agreement with ge capital corp 
and a syndicate of lenders for a new secured revolving credit facility 
the former unsecured revolving credit facility was set to expire on november  the term of the new credit agreement is for a period of five years and provides for a line of credit up to million 
the initial proceeds have been used to refinance approximately million of the outstanding indebtedness under the company s former bank line of credit  the senior note of million  a million accounts receivable sale arrangement and the canadian credit facility of million 
the company recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of taxes  in the second quarter of  for a prepayment penalty and write off of unamortized fees for the retirement of the above related debt 
availability under the new credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets 
direct borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined or the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  at the option of the company 
borrowings are collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the terms of the new revolving credit facility contain  among other provisions  requirements of maintaining defined levels of tangible net worth and specific limits or restrictions on additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  liens and acquisitions 
in july  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate debt under the revolving credit facility to a fixed rate  without exchanging the notional principal amounts 
at december   the company had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements maturing in january and  with aggregate notional principal amounts of million 
under these agreements the company receives a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pays a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and on a notional amount of million 
on july   the company issued convertible subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures are convertible into approximately  shares of the company s common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the convertible debentures were used to prepay an senior note payable  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of the company s common stock 
the company sold certain accounts receivable to an independent financial institution  through its wholly owned subsidiary  smp credit corp  a qualifying special purpose corporation 
in may smp credit corp 
entered into a three year agreement whereby it could sell up to a million undivided ownership interest in a designated pool of certain of these eligible receivables 
this agreement was terminated in as part of the new credit facility described above 
at december   net accounts receivable amounting to million had been sold under this agreement 
during the years through  the board of directors authorized multiple repurchase programs under which the company could repurchase shares of its common stock 
during such years  million in aggregate of common stock has been repurchased to meet present and future requirements of the company s stock option programs and to fund the company s esop 
as of december  the company has board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately million  primarily for new machinery and equipment 
the company s profitability and working capital requirements have become more seasonal with the increased sales mix of temperature control products 
working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
the company anticipates that its present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet its near term needs 
comparison of to net sales in were million  a slight increase of million as compared to net sales of million in the increase in net sales was a result of new business  offsetting decreases in our existing traditional business lines 
the engine management division benefited from a full year of sales to the new major customer acquired during the third quarter of  incremental sales of approximately million in along with additional wire set business from a major group of warehouse distributors 
with respect to temperature control  we regained a major retail customer we lost in early net sales approximated million in  excluding pipeline fill 
excluding this new business  sales to existing accounts decreased  primarily a result of another cool summer for air conditioning  and the continuing inventory reduction program on the part of many of our customers 
gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to from in the overall decrease in gross margins was primarily due to our successful inventory reduction programs 
the reduction in gross margins was across all product lines as the company originally targeted a minimum million inventory reduction in actual inventory reduction amounted to million while maintaining high customer service fill levels 
these changes reflect the impact of underabsorbed overhead costs as a result of cutting production and temporarily closing manufacturing facilities at both engine management and temperature control facilities 
we expect gross margin increases in both engine management and temperature control as a result of price increases and improved fixed overhead absorption  despite further inventory reduction efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased by million to million as compared to million in this decrease reflects the focus on the company s cost reduction efforts with benefits primarily in the marketing and distribution areas in the temperature control segment 
operating income decreased by million as compared to  primarily due to the lower gross margins as discussed above 
other income  net increased by million as compared to the increase is primarily due to the reduction of fees related to the termination of the sale of accounts receivable agreement and an increase in interest and dividend income 
interest expense decreased slightly by million as compared to  due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings 
income tax expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to overall lower earnings 
the effective tax rate increased from in to in the increase is primarily due to a decrease in earnings from the company s foreign subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates then the united states statutory rate 
comparison of to net sales in were million  a decrease of million or when compared to net sales in temperature control decreased by million primarily due to a significant retail customer achieving substantial inventory reductions  loss of a major retail customer early in the year contributed approximately million to the overall decrease  and a very cool and wet summer in the northeast and mid west 
the customer that was lost in was reacquired in the beginning of with respect to engine management  net sales in were million  an increase of million or when compared to the increase reflects the successful acquisition of a major new customer in the third quarter of contributed approximately million of net sales for the year ended december  
significant warranty and overstock returns in our temperature control segment adversely impacted financial performance in with respect to warranty returns  after thorough analysis of related warranty claims  the company has taken specific actions to reduce compressor warranty returns in and beyond 
the company has instituted new counterperson and installer training programs  increased emphasis on clinics and professional seminars for installers  and tightened rules for authorized warranty returns this the company believes to be the major improvement  which was previously not required 
beginning in  it is a requirement that each and every compressor returned for warranty credit must have either a service repair work order or a purchase receipt providing proof that a number of additional auxiliary parts were replaced concurrently ie accumulator  orifice tube  in line filter  condenser and that an air conditioning system flushing with an approved solvent was performed 
if the twelve step process  is not performed as defined by the company  the warranty is void 
with respect to overstock returns  was adversely impacted by the company s decision to accept customer returns in connection with the company s decision to discontinue the offering of certain temperature control products 
the year was absent of any such significant decision 
in addition  during  the company placed further restrictions on the amounts that customers can return as overstock returns 
gross margins  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in temperature control gross margins were positively impacted by reduced customer returns and an increase in net pricing 
engine management margins were positively impacted by increased sales volume  increases in net pricing and certain cost reductions activities discussed below 
in connection with cost reduction activities  the year was benefited by the consolidation of three distribution centers into one in our temperature control segment  merging our existing fan clutch operations in our temperature control segment  and moving two us manufacturing plants to a single facility in mexico in the engine management segment 
the aforementioned initiatives improved operating income of temperature control and engine management segments by approximately million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased approximately million in  primarily a result of the cost reduction efforts described in the previous paragraph and a decrease in bad debt expense as compared to operating income increased by million  or in results of the engine management division  as compared to a year ago  reflected an increase in operating income of million due to higher sales  favorable overhead absorption and cost reduction activities 
operating income at the temperature control division decreased by million  primarily due to the net sales decrease reasons cited above 
the company has strengthened its controls and procedures for accepting authorized customer warranty returns in  and has completed the consolidation of its manufacturing and distribution facilities 
these changes have had a favorable impact on results and are expected to provide future benefits 
other income  net  was approximately 
million  comparing favorably to other expense  net of million in this is primarily the result of our decision to exit the heat battery joint venture in canada 
interest expense increased by approximately million to million in  primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from elevated inventory levels and decreased sales 
income tax expense decreased from million in to million in the effective tax rate also decreased from in to in due to an increase in earnings from the company s puerto rico and hong kong subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates than the united states statutory rate 
on march   the company prepaid the entire outstanding balance of the senior note payable in the amount of million 
in connection with this prepayment  the company incurred an extraordinary loss of million net of taxes  for prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan costs 
impact of inflation although inflation is not a significant issue  the company s management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings 
this will be achieved principally by cost reduction programs and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
future results of operations the company continues to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins  the company is continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
however  the company s main focus currently is to reduce inventory levels requiring reductions in production and purchasing levels 
gross margins have been  and will continue to be negatively impacted resulting from underabsorbed overhead 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily sales which include replacement parts for motor vehicles  from both our engine management and temperature control divisions 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to customers 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period see discussion on recently issued accounting standards 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
see discussion on recently issued accounting standards 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability including asbestos matters and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting standards in may and april  the fasb emerging issues task force the eitf issued new guidelines entitled accounting for certain sales incentives and vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products respectively  the guidelines 
these guidelines address when sales incentives and discounts should be recognized and the accounting for certain costs incurred by a vendor on behalf of a customer  as well as where the related revenues and expenses should be classified in the financial statements 
the guidelines  as amended  are effective beginning january  and prior years financial statements will be restated for purposes of comparability 
the adoption of these guidelines will not have an effect on the company s net earnings  however  certain costs incurred by the company and historically recorded as selling  general and administrative expense will be reclassified and treated as a reduction from gross sales to derive at net sales 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria to determine whether intangible assets acquired in a business combination should be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
sfas no 
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 the company has unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
management is currently analyzing the impact of adoption of this standard  but believes this standard is likely to result in the impairment of a portion of the company s goodwill 
the company has substantially completed the first step of the initial impairment test required by the standard and identified approximately million of goodwill that may be impaired based on the new requirements 
the company will complete the impairment testing required to determine the actual amount of goodwill impairment in the first fiscal quarter of any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of statement no 
for the quarter ending march  to accomplish this  the company must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require the company to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  the company will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
because of the effort necessary to comply with the adoption of statement no 
 it is not practicable for management to estimate the impact of adopting this statement at the date of this report 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which supersedes both fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
statement retains the fundamental provisions in statement for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement for example  statement provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived assets that will be disposed of other than by sale 
statement retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike statement  an impairment assessment under statement will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is required to adopt statement no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of statement will have on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  the company is exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of its financing 
it is the company s policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk the company has exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the company s financial instruments which are subject to this exposure amount to approximately million  which includes million of indebtedness  million in accounts payable and million of accounts receivable 
the potential immediate loss to the company that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on the company s foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in its debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of its exposure to interest rate changes  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  the company had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
the company invests its excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
as a result of the company s refinancing agreement during the second quarter  as described in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s percentage of variable rate debt to total debt has increased from at december  to at december  depending upon the level of borrowings  under this credit facility  which may at times approach million  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on the earnings or cash flows of the company
