item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated statements of operations on page  which presents the results of our operations for   and the following discussion should be read with an understanding of the risk factors on pages through  which describe events that could influence our forward looking projections 
during the period covered by this discussion  we have made significant investments in research and development allocating significant funding for low profile satellite antennas  fiber optic gyroscopes fogs  and photonic fiber modulators 
our strategy has been to accelerate our research efforts in order to reach the market with products as quickly as possible  and in making these decisions  we planned to incur operating losses 
the products in development provide significant price performance benefits that may lead to a market leadership position in these potentially very large markets 
our investment in fog technology began in october  when we purchased the intellectual property and assets of andrew corporation s fiber optic research group 
over the past four years  we completed the development  begun by andrew corporation  of open loop fiber optic gyroscopes  established a vertically integrated fiber optic manufacturing process and integrated fiber optic technology into our existing product lines 
we began selling modest quantities of fogs in  and subsequently increased our sales volumes as we improved our product designs 
in we achieved positive gross margin for the first year since our investment began 
our outlook for accelerated fog growth is very positive as we begin to establish fiber optic products in the defense  optical telecommunications infrastructure  and power management markets 
we are encouraged by the growth of fog sales  which rose to million or from results of million  and we believe our fog sales will continue to accelerate in in the second half of  we began research into both low profile satellite antenna systems and photonic fiber modulators 
in order to fund our development initiatives we raised million net of investment fees  through a series of private stock offerings that were concluded in may our strategy in carrying out our research has been to make extensive use of outside consultants in combination with existing in house scientists  an approach that minimizes our fixed costs  which allows us to reduce research and development expense rapidly as we conclude our research efforts 
our goal is to complete our new product research in and bring our new products to market in the second half of year 
we believe that forecast revenue increases and the conclusion of our project research will result in a return to profitable operations in late results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of revenues years ended december  net sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss other expense income  net loss income before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss years ended december  and net sales net sales increased by to approximately million from roughly million in communication product revenues made up of our sales growth  increasing by to million from million in the slowdown of communication sales growth was triggered by increases in fuel prices and economic uncertainties that had a negative impact on rv sales  which is one of the largest applications for our land mobile communications products 
towards the end of gasoline prices fell  and the rv market began to recover its strength  stimulating renewed sales growth 
we steadily grew our reseller distribution network during  entering into agreements with major rv distributors and manufacturers  positioning kvh for renewed growth in we are optimistic that domestic communication sales could grow at double the rate experienced in  led by revitalized rv growth  the potential for significant oem sales  and new product releases 
navigation sales increased in to million from million in this sales increase was the result of three factors defense shipments declined by million from million in  fiber optic revenues grew to million from million in  and oem shipments doubled in to million from million in recent events have created a significant demand for tactical navigation systems  such as our tacnav light system  which is deployed on light armored vehicles 
although our defense shipments declined in  we were able to demonstrate our products to a wide range of defense customers and have a record number of quotations in our customers hands 
as a result of these efforts our tacnav products have won wide acceptance within the us military and allied military circles 
we forecast significant growth in the defense market that could double defense revenues in overall  we anticipate that the rate of combined sales growth in will accelerate  and we anticipate increases in net sales of to 
however  a prolonged economic downturn or delays within the military procurement process could weaken our current growth outlook 
cost of goods sold the company s cost of goods sold consists of direct labor  materials  manufacturing overheads and engineering costs associated with customer funded engineering 
customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold were approximately million in and million in during we realized material and labor cost savings that were sufficient to offset price reductions that were planned in cost reductions resulted from the redesign of existing products and improvements in our manufacturing process 
our supply chain materials management system continued to provide us with stronger control over our manufacturing inventories and provided the tools required to better manage our procurement process 
this resulted in more favorable material purchase agreements and better pricing 
manufacturing overheads decreased by in and overheads fell as a percentage of sales to from in the prior year 
improved manufacturing overheads reflect increased fog capacity utilization and better management of rhode island manufacturing resources 
looking ahead we believe that costs of goods sold will decline modestly as a percentage of sales from levels  resulting from higher levels of facility utilization and a continuation of manufacturing improvements 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overheads  and other direct costs resulting from the company s internally funded product development activities 
all internal research and development costs are expenses in the period they are incurred 
internally funded development costs increased approximately million or in from million in the cost increase is the result of the acceleration of two development projects  a high speed in fiber modulator and a low profile satellite antenna 
the combined costs of these two projects amounted to million dollars in non project r d decreased slightly as a result of increased customer funding of defense programs in  a trend that should accelerate in almost one third of r d spending reflects the use of outside consultants and university researchers to support our project developments 
we are optimistic that we will conclude our projects late in and our outside costs will decline quickly once our research is completed 
our current outlook forecasts a decline in r d spending of roughly million dollars in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  cooperative advertising  sales literature  advertising  and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by to million in from million in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as commissions  trade shows  media  and new product introductions 
in addition  roughly of the increase related to the reorganization of the post sales customer support group into a new customer service team that provides comprehensive support to the customer  including order placement  product shipment  repair service  and a customer help desk 
we have broadened our product offerings to include high speed broadband internet capability  and we have begun the process of staffing that function 
products requiring hour a day  day a week customer support will continue to drive support cost increases in our sales forecast includes a significant number of high commission defense sales to foreign militaries 
we will also strengthen our presence in defense and fog markets with the hiring of kvh direct sales representatives 
overall  we believe selling expense will increase by roughly in absolute terms  but will decline as a percentage of sales to the low s from of sales in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative costs increased million to million or in over and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to from in cost increases reflect annual salary increases  and rising professional fees 
looking ahead into we anticipate that general and administrative costs will increase roughly over results 
cost drivers include insurance premium increases resulting from the insurance industry s reaction to losses incurred as a result of the events of september   and staffing increases 
we forecast that administration expense will increase between and from results but decline as a percentage of revenues from levels of 
interest income interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash from our private offering in fully insured  federal short term obligations 
interest expense interest expense is made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan and equipment leases 
income tax benefit total income tax benefit for the year ended december  was allocated to income from continuing operations and stockholders equity  but was fully reserved with a valuation allowance and therefore zero income tax benefit was accounted for in our statement of operations  or additional paid in capital for stock based compensation income tax benefits eg  from current year disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and exercise of non qualified stock options 
in  as a consequence of an internal revenue service tax return examination  we made adjustments to income tax credits recorded in prior years 
no further adjustments to financial statement income tax benefit have been made in connection with the ongoing tax return examination 
for a further discussion of income taxes see note to the financial statements 
years ended december  and net sales net sales increased by to approximately million from million in communication product revenues made up of our sales growth  increasing to million from million in domestic communication sales grew by while international sales increased from levels 
navigation sales increased to million from million in the growth in navigation sales reflects the acceptance of our tacnav products by international military forces where sales of our tacnav products were particularly strong 
we anticipate that navigation sales growth will accelerate in as the united states military begins to deploy vehicles that are equipped for the digital battlefield  a market that we believe holds significant promise for our tactical navigation products 
fiber optic navigation products began shipping in volume in cost of goods sold the company s cost of goods sold consists of direct labor  materials  manufacturing overhead  and engineering costs associated with customer funded engineering 
customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold were approximately million in and million in during we realized material and labor cost savings amounting to of sales 
product cost reductions resulted from redesign of existing product and improvements in our manufacturing process 
we made significant efficiency gains in our procurement process by implementing supply chain management in the last half of the year allowing us to better plan inventories and negotiate lower material prices 
although manufacturing overheads increased in absolute dollars by approximately million in  overheads fell as a percentage of sales by from the prior year  reflecting increased capacity utilization 
total cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of sales by despite a sales shift towards lower margin communication sales 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overhead  and other direct costs resulting from the company s internally funded product development activities 
all internal development costs  including software development  are expensed in the period incurred 
internally funded development costs decreased approximately million or in from million in the decrease in internal product development costs resulted from a doubling of customer funded research 
costs associated with customer funded research are transferred out of the r d line into cost of goods sold 
a comparison of combined internal and external development costs reflects increased total research and development costs of million or a increase above levels 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  cooperative advertising  sales literature  advertising  and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by million in from million in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as commissions  trade shows  media  and new product introductions 
the cost increase over the prior year was roughly half our annual sales increase and although spending increased in absolute terms  it decreased as a percentage of revenues by of sales to of revenues from in kvh utilizes independent  third party distribution channels including dealers  distributors  and sales representatives 
third party distribution allows us to grow rapidly without adding the fixed costs associated with a direct sales force 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative costs increased million or in over  but decreased as a percentage of sales to from in the previous year 
cost increases reflect annual salary increases  and rising professional fees 
interest income interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in federal short term obligations 
interest expense interest expense is made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan  our revolving bank credit facility  and equipment leases 
income tax benefit as a result of generating operating losses for the past three years    the company has recorded additional deferred tax assets with associated deferred tax benefits 
the operating loss and tax credit items giving rise to deferred tax assets are carried forward and may offset future taxable income and tax expense  before expiration beginning in and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rates were for and for the increase in the rate and related income tax benefit is principally due to certain reductions to deferred tax assets 
the tax rate of is the result of re evaluating the realizability of certain income tax credits previously established and made part of the company s deferred tax assets 
certain income tax credits were reduced in connection with the progress of an existing internal revenue service tax return examination 
liquidity and capital resources on january   the company entered into a mortgage loan in the amount of  the note term is years  with a principal amortization of years at a fixed rate of interest of 
land  building and improvements secure the mortgage loan 
the monthly mortgage payment is  including interest and principal 
due to the difference in the term of the note and amortization of the principal  a balloon payment of  is due on february  the principal paid in totaled  and as of december    was outstanding 
on march  we entered into a million asset based  three year  revolving loan facility at an interest rate of the prime bank lending rate plus 
any unused portion of the revolving credit facility accrues interest at an annual rate of basis points 
the loan facility provides for advancing funds based upon an asset availability formula that includes our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the availability formula sets aside a fixed amount of qualified assets that may not be borrowed against 
we may terminate the loan prior to the full term 
however  we would become liable for certain termination fees should we do so 
in december we received a  customer deposit to fund expenditures we are incurring to design and manufacture an order that was partially shipped in  and the remainder of the order is anticipated to ship during first two quarters of the customer deposit is being amortized against customer receivables on a pro rata basis as we invoice our customer 
at december    of the customer deposit remains unamortized and will be applied to shipments 
on december  we sold  common shares to the state of wisconsin investment board at per share 
on april  and april   we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to special situations fund iii  lp  special situations cayman fund  lp  special situations private equity fund  lp  and special situations technology fund  lp  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement dated march  on april   we also issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to the state of wisconsin investment board  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement dated april  on may   we issued and sold  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to mr 
austin marxe 
we concluded our private financing on may   with the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to the massachusetts mutual life insurance company 
in total we realized net proceeds of million  that is being used to fund operations and advanced research into photonics and mobile broadband satellite communications 
we believe that existing cash balances and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for if we decide to expand more rapidly  to broaden or enhance products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to remain competitive  then we may need to raise additional funds 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which management believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets and recoverability of deferred tax assets 
the company s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on specific and historical criteria that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
the company evaluates specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated on a monthly basis and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
an additional reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience and are analyzed on a quarterly basis 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company continually ensures that slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value by reviewing current quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices on products 
generally  the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of its products being interchangeable with various product offerings 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
long lived assets are reviewed for indications of impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows 
the preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
on a quarterly basis the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the history of operating earnings in its ongoing business and its expectations in the future  the company has determined that a portion of the deferred tax assets were not recoverable and a valuation allowance was established 
for the remaining deferred tax assets the recoverability of these assets was deemed to be recoverable based on certain tax planning strategies 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the future if there are changes in the company s feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
additionally  if the company generates future earnings the realizability of the deferred tax assets reserved by the valuation allowance would be utilized 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provision of sfas no 
as of july   and it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company would also record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on january  and it does not expect to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on january  and it does not expect to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our contractual commitments consist of a mortgage note payable  facility and equipment leases 
the principal repayment of the mortgage note is based upon a year amortization schedule  but the term is years requiring a balloon payment of  due on february  there are no loan to value covenants in the loan that would require early pay down of the mortgage if the market value of the property should decline 
we are obligated under a multi year facility lease that terminates in our present intention is to renew the facility lease prior to its expiration in our operating leases represent vehicle and equipment operating leases 
the schedule below reflects our liabilities under these agreements 
total after mortgage loan     facility lease    operating leases   total contractual cash obligations     we have not entered into any off balance sheet commercial commitments such as standby letters of credit  guarantees  and standby repurchase obligation or other commercial commitments 
other matters none 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
forward looking statements risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our previous statements 
we may fail to complete our mobile broadband development initiative successfully our mobile broadband project is in the development stage 
the kvh mobile broadband initiative is directed toward the development of a low profile satellite tv antenna that will provide in motion access to high speed  two way internet and satellite television services for the video and computer systems aboard automobiles and other vehicles 
the project involves significant technical advances and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the form factor  performance  and cost parameters necessary for successful commercialization of these products 
a delay or failure to create our activefiber technology could prevent the development of an affordable flat panel  phased array antenna 
if we are delayed in our development of our mobile broadband technology and or are not first to market with this technology  we may be unable to achieve significant market share in the automotive mobile satellite communication market 
the success of the tracnet mobile high speed internet service depends on the performance and quality of other service providers 
the new tracnet service is designed to provide mobile high speed internet access to vehicles and vessels throughout north america and as far as miles off the coast 
tracnet s successful operation depends on the use of kvh s antenna and other components with services and equipment of other suppliers 
specifically  tracnet will rely upon the service offered by the satellite internet provider bell expressvu of canada  as well as the equipment and services of cellular and satellite return link communications suppliers 
globalstar satellite communications services  which kvh intends to use as the satellite return link supplier for tracnet  filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on february  and currently is operating its business as a debtor in possession 
should globalstar or one of the other vendors integral to tracnet s operation be unable to fulfill its obligations  kvh will seek an alternate supplier and carry out any necessary hardware and software retrofits or upgrades that may be required to ensure the continued operation of the tracnet system 
in such event  kvh may not be able to identify and enter into appropriate agreements with replacement suppliers 
pricing of our mobile satellite communication products is critical to product acceptance the success of our mobile broadband project depends upon our ability to develop a technologically advanced antenna at an acceptable price for the automotive marketplace 
to date  phased array antennas have been developed at prices far in excess of what is practical in the automotive marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can engineer a phased array solution within the pricing and technical parameters necessary to be successful in the automotive marketplace 
we may fail to complete our photonic fiber development initiative successfully our photonic fiber project is currently in the development stage 
we are developing our activefiber technology consisting of photonic fiber products that we believe will replace electro optic components and create an active fiber networking solution that would greatly enhance the speed of transmissions over fiber optic networks 
we may never complete the technological development necessary to realize the full commercial potential of the project 
our current approach utilizes a new electro optic polymer and our d fiber technology 
the photonic fiber initiative involves significant technical advances  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the form factor  performance  and cost parameters necessary for successful commercialization of this technology 
if we are delayed in our development of our photonic fiber technology and or are not first to market with this technology  we may be unable to achieve significant market share in the fiber optic networking market 
failure to complete development of our photonic fiber technology will also prevent us from developing a phase shifter based on that technology  which may impair our ability to effectively provide mobile broadband communications services to automobiles through the use of a flat panel  phased array antenna 
research and development expenditures could adversely affect the company s operating results for the past four years we have made significant investments in research and development that have contributed to operating losses in each of those years 
in may  we completed a series of private placements that raised million  net of transaction costs  to accelerate our research into two key product areas  photonic fiber and mobile broadband 
through  our product development expenditures of million in these areas contributed significantly to operating losses 
our expectation is that as the r d efforts conclude  our r d spending will rapidly return to historical levels 
if product development and the corresponding r d expenditures have to be extended beyond our current projections of million this year or the entry to market of the resulting products is delayed  it may slow our anticipated return to profitability 
in  we increased our operating expenses by million to accelerate the development and take advantage of anticipated revenue opportunities related to our photonic fiber and mobile broadband initiatives 
our decision to increase spending resulted from our desire to bring these products to market as quickly as possible 
should we continue to accelerate spending beyond current budgeted levels for we could continue to experience operating losses and negative cash flows 
future sales growth depends on the continued expansion of satellite communication revenues to date  the company s growth has been sustained by a consistent expansion of our satellite communications sales 
our future satellite communications sales growth will be based to a considerable extent upon the successful introduction of new mobile satellite communications products for use in marine and land applications 
our success depends heavily on rapid completion of new products  particularly for worldwide internet and data applications 
however  poor consumer confidence and or economic conditions could depress product demand 
our success also depends on external variables such as consumers access to satellite communication services  which may be hindered because satellite launches and new technology are expensive and subject to failures  depressing demand for our products 
defense related sales could be adversely affected by political and international events recent world events and a shift in military planning to favor rapid deployment and lighter vehicles put a premium on precision navigation  a feature offered by kvh s integrated tactical navigation systems 
based on our shippable backlog entering and current military procurement schedules  we anticipate a doubling of our defense related revenues during  which will be critical to our return to overall profitability 
however  this growth could be adversely affected by delays in the current military procurement schedule  an unexpected shift or reallocation of anticipated funding for military programs  delays in the testing and acceptance of our technological solutions by the military  and sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict in military markets 
our operating results are variable our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon all the foregoing risk factors and how successful we are in improving our ratios of revenues to expenses 
our share price has displayed volatility the company s stock has experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock in the future 
our consumer product sales are dependent on the financial strength and performance of our distribution network many of our consumer oriented products are marketed through a third party worldwide network of value added resellers  distributors  and independent sales representatives 
many of the company s resellers operate on narrow product margins  and may distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened  if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
if we fail to commercialize new product lines  our business will suffer we intend to continue to develop new product lines and to improve existing product lines to meet our customers diverse and changing needs 
however  our development of new products and improvements to existing products may not be successful  due to our failure to complete the development of a new product or product improvement  or our failure to sell our new product or improved product because  among other things  the product is too expensive  is defective in design  manufacture or performance  is inferior to similar products on the market  or has been superceded by a superior product or technology 
furthermore  new products require increased sales and marketing  customer support  and administrative functions to support anticipated increased levels of operations 
we may not be successful in creating this infrastructure  and we may not realize a sufficient increase in gross profit to offset the expenses resulting from this expanded infrastructure 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
claims by other companies that we infringe their copyrights or patents could adversely affect our financial condition if any of our products violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to reengineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  and  in any case  would substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
although we are generally indemnified against claims that third party technology that we license infringes the proprietary rights of others  this indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property rights for example  patents may be excluded and in some cases the scope of such indemnification is limited 
even if we receive broad indemnification  third party indemnitors are not always well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event of infringement  resulting in substantial exposure to us 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims arising from the incorporation of third party technology in our products  and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from these claims  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from their business 
a party making a claim also could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience  and efforts of the company s ceo  martin kits van heyningen  and our senior executives the loss of the services of mr 
kits van heyningen could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
gneral economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the company the company s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions
