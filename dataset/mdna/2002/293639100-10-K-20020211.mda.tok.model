item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network advertising  event revenue and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
we include revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations in net revenues  while we reflect operating expenses associated with these stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a station owned and operated by us 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore its effect on advertising revenues tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
as a result of the tragic events of september   radio advertising was severely curtailed for several days and the negative effects on advertisers and radio broadcasters continued into the next quarter 
we calculate same station results by comparing the performance of stations operated by us throughout the relevant period to the comparable performance in the prior year s corresponding period  adjusted for significant changes to sports contracts 
for purposes of the following discussion  pro forma net income represents historical income before income taxes  extraordinary item and accounting change adjusted as if we were treated as a c corporation during all relevant periods at an effective tax rate of  applied to income before income taxes  extraordinary item and accounting change and the effect of the adjustment to reflect indexing of the convertible subordinated note the amount of this adjustment is not tax deductible 
recent event s on november   we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of wski fm and wpet am  serving the greensboro  north carolina radio market  for a purchase price of million in cash  of which million was paid as a deposit on november  on december   we began operating these stations under a time brokerage agreement 
the closing of this transaction  which is conditional upon the approval of the fcc  is expected to occur in the first quarter of and will increase our ownership to six radio stations in the greensboro  north carolina radio market 
on december   we entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of kosi fm  kkhk fm and kezw am  serving the denver  colorado radio market  for a purchase price of million in cash  of which million was paid as a deposit on january  on february   we began operating these stations under a time brokerage agreement 
the time brokerage agreement may run for a period of up to three years at the seller s option 
closing of this transaction may be delayed at the option of the seller  not to exceed three years  and is conditioned on the approval of the fcc 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank facility for which compliance is required in connection with the closing of the transaction 
on february   we entered into an agreement effective february   to terminate our joint sales agreement for king fm in the seattle  washington radio market  that was due to expire on june  results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were heavily impacted by our acquisition of radio stations from sinclair broadcast group  inc in and year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  december  amounts in thousands net revenues   decrease of  or net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a same station basis  net revenues decreased to million from million 
net revenues and same station net revenues declined due to a combination of general weakness in the advertising sector  comparisons to the prior year in which we experienced growth and the effect of the tragic events of september   when radio advertising was severely curtailed for several days and its negative effects continued into the next quarter 
the overall decline in net revenues was also affected by acquisitions and divestitures 
for the years ended december  and  we acquired stations with net revenues of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we terminated sports contracts under which we sold advertising with net revenues of million  and for the year ended december   we divested stations with net revenues of million  plus million in net revenues from terminated sports contracts under which we sold advertising 
year ended december  december  amounts in thousands station operating expenses   decrease of  or percentage of net revenues station operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a same station basis  station operating expenses decreased to million from million 
station operating expenses and same station operating expenses declined due to a decrease in sales expense as a result of a decrease in same station net revenues and cost reduction efforts

year ended december  december  amounts in thousands depreciation and amortization   increase of  or percentage of net revenues depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions  net of divestitures  since january  we expect that the adoption on january  of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as described more fully under recent pronouncements  will materially reduce our non cash amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses which will have a material impact on our financial statements because the amount currently recorded for the amortization of goodwill and broadcasting licenses is significant 
for the years ended december  and  the amounts of amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses were million and million and million and million  respectively 
however  this reduction in our non cash amortization expense does not include any adjustments for potential write downs that could result based on the outcome of the required impairment tests under the provisions of sfas no 
year ended december  december  amounts in thousands corporate general and administrative expenses   decrease of or percentage of net revenues corporate general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to cost reduction efforts  offset by the effect of inflation and the growth in the number of stations

the overall decline in broadcast cash flow was affected by acquisitions and divestitures 
for the years ended december  and  we acquired stations with broadcast cash flow of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we terminated sports contracts under which we sold advertising and incurred a broadcast cash flow deficit of million and for the year ended december   we divested stations with million in broadcast cash flow  plus million incurred as a broadcast cash flow deficit from terminated sports contracts under which we sold advertising

year ended december  december  amounts in thousands after tax cash flow   decrease of  or after tax cash flow decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  after tax cash flow was negatively impacted by the decrease in broadcast cash flow  offset by the decrease in interest expense  net of tax  and the tax benefits from the purchase of radio station assets since january  the effective tax rate during these periods was positively affected by amortization of intangibles that were deductible for tax purposes in excess of the amounts reflected for book purposes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  december  amounts in thousands net revenues   increase of  or net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to stations that we acquired or that we were in the process of acquiring since january   offset by million for stations that we divested including million in revenues from a sports contract for which we discontinued selling advertising during the same period

year ended december  december  amounts in thousands income before income taxes and extraordinary item   increase of  or percentage of net revenues income before income taxes and extraordinary item increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gains on sale of assets of million primarily from the gain on the disposition of two radio stations in the current period  and an increase in operating income  exclusive of the gains on sale of assets  of million due to increases in revenues from existing and newly acquired stations and improved expense management from newly acquired stations  offset by an increase of million in net interest expense and financing costs as a result of the factors described above under interest expense  an increase in expense of million from the recognition of a loss on investments and an equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate  and a decrease in interest income of million as a result of the absence this year of excess cash available from our october class a common stock and tides offerings during the period prior to the closing on december   of the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair  including a radio station under a time brokerage agreement 
extraordinary item  net of taxes the extraordinary item for the year ended december  resulted from the write off of million million  net of taxes of unamortized finance charges due to the early extinguishment of debt 
the early extinguishment of debt resulted from the refinancing of our previous credit facility 
year ended december  december  amounts in thousands net income loss   increase of  net income increased to million for the year ended december  from a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the absence this year of an adjustment made during the prior year to record a one time non cash deferred income tax expense of million as a result of the revocation of our s corporation election and our conversion to a c corporation we recorded this expense to reflect the cumulative effect of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities attributable to our conversion to a c corporation  a net increase in gain on sale of assets of million  net of tax  primarily from the disposition of two radio stations in the current period  and an improvement in operating income  excluding gains on sale of assets  of million  net of tax  primarily as a result of an improvement in revenues of existing and newly acquired stations and an improvement in expense management of newly acquired stations  offset by an increase in interest expense of million  net of tax  for the factors described under interest expense  an increase in expense of million  net of tax  from the recognition of a loss on investments and an equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate and a decrease in interest income of million  net of tax  as a result of the absence this year of excess cash available from our october class a common stock and tides offerings during the period prior to the closing on december   of the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair  including a radio station under a time brokerage agreement

the amount of the deferred income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and the amount of the pro forma deferred income tax expense was million for the year ended december  the amount of the deferred income tax expense attributable to the gains on sale of assets  loss on investments and equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate was million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we use a significant portion of our capital resources to reduce outstanding debt and to consummate acquisitions 
acquisitions are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our bank facility described below  the sale of our securities  the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  and internally generated cash flow 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and as compared to the years ended december  and  respectively  were heavily impacted by our acquisition of the radio stations from sinclair in and operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes in our net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily a result of changes in advertising revenues and station operating expenses  which are affected by the acquisition and disposition of stations during those periods 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a reduction in net cash flows utilized for working capital 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were positively affected primarily by the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair and other radio station acquisitions  offset by the required divestiture of two radio stations in kansas city  excluding the station we acquired from sinclair and immediately sold  and an increase in accounts receivable on acquired stations  net of the kansas city divestiture 
investing and financing activities net cash flows used in investing activities declined to million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net impact of acquisitions  divestitures and capital expenditures in the prior years 
net cash flows used by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  and net cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the cash flows for the year ended december  reflect a net reduction in outstanding debt of million  an increase of million as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the absence this year of any station acquisitions 
the cash flows for the year ended december   reflect acquisitions and investments consummated and the related borrowings and the proceeds from the required disposition of certain of the kansas city stations 
the cash flows for the year ended december   reflect acquisitions consummated and the related borrowings  net proceeds from our initial public offering and the related payment of long term debt  net proceeds from our october class a common stock and tides offerings and the related payment of long term debt  and the distribution to our s corporation shareholders of million primarily from the funds available from the sale of our tampa stations 
our business generally does not require substantial investment of capital 
our capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
despite an increase in the average number of radio stations owned throughout this year as compared to the average number of radio stations owned throughout the prior year  primarily from the acquisition of radio stations in the wichita and madison markets during the prior year  and despite the continued relocation of studio facilities in certain markets  our capital expenditures increased only marginally for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
on february   upon the consummation of our initial public offering  we received net proceeds of million  after deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions 
we used these proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our former credit facility and to pay other corporate obligations 
shortly after reducing indebtedness under our former credit facility  in february we borrowed approximately million to purchase three boston radio stations from cbs 
on october   we completed our class a common stock and tides offerings and received million and million in proceeds  respectively  after deducting discounts  commissions  fees and expenses 
the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
we used the net proceeds from our october class a common stock offering and the tides offering  together with cash on hand and proceeds from our bank facility  to finance the million in cash to consummate the purchase of radio stations from sinclair on december  as of february   we have transactions pending pursuant to agreements to purchase five radio stations in two markets having an aggregate purchase price of million excluding the commitment to purchase kwod fm  sacramento  as this transaction is currently in litigation 
under these agreements  we have funded into escrow deposits to be applied against the purchase price upon closing 
closing on one of these transactions can be deferred for up to three years at the seller s option 
we intend to finance the pending acquisitions primarily from borrowings under our existing bank facility  an amended or new bank facility and future cash flows from operations 
additionally  we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
our bank facility requires that at the time of closing on these transactions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank facility 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank facility 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending or entering into a new bank facility  obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate the pending transactions 
in addition to debt service and quarterly distributions under the tides  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and acquisitions of additional radio stations 
for year  we estimate that capital expenditures  necessary for maintaining our facilities  will be between million and million 
we are also committed to fund an investment focused on minority owned businesses in the amount of approximately million as of december  we believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with available revolving and term credit borrowings under our bank facility  should be sufficient to permit us to fund our current operations 
however  in order to finance the pending acquisitions and future acquisitions  if any  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under our bank facility in addition to an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of million  of which most was incurred in connection with the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair 
we entered into our bank facility as of december   with a syndicate of banks for million in senior secured credit consisting of million in a reducing revolving credit facility  and million in a multi draw term loan that was fully drawn as of september  our bank facility was established to refinance our existing indebtedness  provide working capital  and fund corporate acquisitions 
at our election  interest on any outstanding principal accrues at a rate based on either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or on keybank na s base rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
although we may borrow  repay and re borrow under the revolving credit facility  the aggregate maximum amount that we can have outstanding at any one time is reduced on a quarterly basis beginning on september  in amounts that vary from million to million for each loan 
under the bank facility  the reducing revolving credit facility and multi draw term loan mature on september  our bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios that are defined terms within the agreement 
we believe we are in compliance with the covenants and leverage ratios 
we expect to use the credit available under the revolving credit facility to fund pending and future acquisitions 
the amount available under the bank facility was million as of december  our bank facility also provides that at any time prior to december  we may solicit additional incremental loans of up to million  and we will be governed under the same terms as the existing bank facility 
however  there can be no guarantee that  upon request  we will receive commitments for any of the incremental loans 
on february   we entered into an amendment with our lenders under our bank facility to further clarify the terms under which we can issue subordinated debt and to modify certain terms  including the pro forma debt service ratio financial covenant

this obligation is the responsibility of our current national sales representative and arose in connection with our acquisition of the stations involved 
under a partnership agreement  carried as an investment  we are obligated to increase our investment 
at december   we have interest rate transactions outstanding where we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount against the variable debt 
the notional amount outstanding at december  was million 
the marked to market valuation is determined by using quoted market prices from the counter parties to these agreements 
under certain circumstances  the interest rate transaction liability of million at december   could be due and payable prior to the expiration of the agreements 
recently issued pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 business combinations and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
statement no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement no 
also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
we adopted this statement on july  we have historically used the purchase method to account for all business combinations and we do not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which requires that goodwill and certain intangibles not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed annually for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
this statement applies to goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired prior to june  and was adopted by us on january  because the amount previously recorded for the amortization of goodwill and broadcasting licenses is significant  we expect that adoption of this accounting standard will have the impact of reducing our non cash amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses and will have a material impact on our financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  the amounts of amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses were million and million  million and million and million and million  respectively 
the required impairment tests of goodwill and broadcasting licenses may result in future period write downs 
in order to complete the transitional assessment of goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets impairment  we will need to identify the reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we will have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the reporting unit s goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle our consolidated statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we have unamortized goodwill and unamortized broadcasting licenses in the amounts of million and  million  respectively 
we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  or development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
under this standard  guidance is provided on measuring and recording the liability 
we intend to adopt this statement effective january  we do not believe that adoption of this statement will materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of it removes goodwill from its scope and retains the requirements of sfas no 
regarding the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets held for use 
sfas no 
also supercedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas no 
may have on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  such impact  if any  is not known or reasonably estimable at this time 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
the exact impact is indeterminable 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the united states department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
for example  in connection with the sinclair kansas city acquisition we were required to dispose of three radio stations in kansas city 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be  subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
as a result  under certain circumstances  all or a partial amount of our escrow deposits of million  made in connection with the pending acquisitions  could be forfeited if we are unable to timely consummate all or any of our pending acquisitions 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations  and the risk of integration is higher during a period of significant or rapid growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million and shareholders equity of million 
in addition to our obligations on our long term indebtedness  we have quarterly interest obligations on the debentures held by the trust that fund distributions on the tides 
these obligations are substantial in amount and could have a substantial impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   million was available under our million current bank facility 
at any time prior to december   we may solicit incremental loans up to million  thereby increasing the bank facility to billion 
the banks participating in our bank facility are not obligated to provide such incremental loans 
moreover  under certain circumstances  we may need to modify or enter into a new bank facility to close on our pending or future acquisitions and we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing 
we have no assurances that we will be able to obtain other funding or additional financing 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our bank facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations in connection with future acquisitions that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the debt we expect to incur in connection with future acquisitions may require us to modify or enter into a new bank facility if certain covenants in our current bank facility would be violated  subjecting us to an event of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and all of our station operating subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio s obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis 
our obligations on the tides  which were purchased by the trust that sells the tides  are subordinated to our obligations on this guarantee 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  are distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot assure you that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our credit facility  would permit such dividends or distributions 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer effectively controls our company  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us 
their interests may conflict with yours 
as of january   joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
as of january   david j

collectively  joseph m 
field and david j 
field beneficially own all of our outstanding class b common stock 
other members of the field family also own shares of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock are transferable only to joseph m 
field  david j 
field  certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit 
upon any other transfer  shares of our class b common stock convert automatically into shares of our class a common stock on a share for share basis 
shares of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes only when they are voted by joseph m 
field or david j 
field  subject to certain exceptions where they are restricted to one vote 
joseph m 
field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to the vote of shareholders and  therefore  is able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters where the shares of our class b common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws or applicable law  including  without limitation  the election of the two class a directors 
without the approval of joseph m 
field  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which investors might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
we depend heavily on our seattle radio stations 
the radio stations we own or operate in seattle generated between and of our net revenues and broadcast cash flows for accordingly we may have greater exposure to any operating difficulties that may arise at our seattle stations or to adverse events or conditions that affect the seattle economy than if we were more geographically diverse 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under certain bank facility covenants that are measured periodically  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
as a result  we have entered into various interest rate transactions with various banks  which we call the rate hedging transactions  designed to mitigate our exposure to significantly higher floating interest rates 
these transactions are referred to as a collar or a swap 
a collar consists of a rate cap agreement that establishes an upper limit or cap for the base libor rate and a rate floor agreement that establishes a lower limit or floor for the base libor rate 
collar agreements covering a rate cap and a rate floor have been entered into simultaneously with the same bank 
swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we have rate hedging transactions in place for a total notional amount of million 
based upon the variable rate debt as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately million 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
all of the rate hedging transactions are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these rate hedging transactions is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation for each of the rate hedging transactions 
the three month libor rate at december  was lower than the rate at december  the decrease in interest rates resulted in a net increase in market value liability of the instruments as of december   despite a reduction in the remaining term under each of the transactions 
effective january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative and hedging activities  that was amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  which are collectively referred to as derivatives and hedging activities 
the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard was reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december
