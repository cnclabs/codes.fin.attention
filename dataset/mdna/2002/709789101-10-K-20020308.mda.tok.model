overview of the income statement in  peoples net income totaled  up  or compared to  last year 
diluted earnings per share improved to in from for the prior year  an increase of or 
peoples enhanced earnings were the result of net interest income growth and higher non interest income 
return on average equity was in versus in while return on average assets was and for the same periods  respectively 
the decline in return on equity can be attributed to the increase in the market value of available for sale securities 
on a cash basis  earnings per diluted share were in  up or compared to the same period in cash basis earnings exclude the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense 
cash basis return on tangible equity and return on tangible assets was and  respectively  in versus and last year 
return on tangible equity is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total stockholders equity minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
return on tangible assets is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total assets minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
in  peoples had amortization expense of  relating to intangible assets acquired under purchase accounting rules for acquisitions in comparison to  in the prior year 
net interest income increased  or to  in  due primarily to a reduction in funding costs 
peoples provision for loan losses totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period last year  up  or 
non interest income excluding all non operating gains and losses grew by  or to  in compared to s total of  key contributors to peoples non interest revenue growth were enhanced electronic banking income and deposit account service charges  as well as revenues from peoples mid investment in business owned life insurance boli 
non interest income was also positively impacted by non recurring income related to stock received in a demutualization recorded in the fourth quarter of peoples non interest expense totaled  in  up  or compared to the prior year  primarily the result of increased salaries and benefits expense 
interest income and expense peoples derives a majority of its interest income from loans and investment securities and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
management periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities in an attempt to control and improve net interest income  however  factors that influence market interest rates  such as interest rate changes by the federal reserve and peoples competitors  may have a greater impact on net interest income than those adjustments made by management 
consequently  a volatile rate environment can make it difficult to manage net interest margin and income  let alone predict future changes 
peoples net interest income totaled  in compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
in  total interest income grew  or to  while interest expense of  was down  or 
the improvement in net interest income is due to both a better mix of funding sources and the aggregate decrease in costs of funds resulting from the federal reserve s aggressive lowering of key interest rates throughout peoples derives a portion of its interest income from states and political subdivisions  which is exempt from taxation 
as a result  management believes it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
in  fte net interest income was  up  or from  in the fte yield on peoples earning assets was for the year ended december   versus for the same period last year  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities was and for the same periods  respectively 
earning assets averaged billion in  up million or compared to the prior year  with the majority of the increase attributable to loan growth 
peoples average interest bearing liabilities increased million or in to million  as volume increases in deposits were partially offset by a reduction in the volume of borrowed funds 
net interest margin calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
throughout  peoples net interest margin improved  reaching in the fourth quarter and for the year compared to and  respectively  for the same periods in the federal reserve s basis point reductions of key interest rates in were the significant drivers of improvement in net interest margin  which facilitated a lowering of peoples costs of funds  however  the magnitude of these reductions has intensified the pressure for lower loan rates in peoples markets  as many clients seek to refinance existing loans 
management believes the recent rate cuts will modestly enhance net interest income streams in early  although  anticipated improvements could be offset in part by decreases in income from prime based commercial loan repricings and other loan refinancings 
loans account for the largest portion of earning assets  averaging million in  with a fte yield of  compared to average loans of million  with a fte yield of  in investment securities decreased million or from s average of million to in the fte yield on investments decreased basis points in to from a year ago 
the yields on both loans and investment securities have been impacted by lower market interest rates 
peoples interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of traditional deposits 
deposit costs declined basis points to from last year 
in  peoples lowered rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts in response to the federal reserve s rate cuts  but changes in deposit mix due to volume increases in certificates of deposit during the first half of this year  as well as very competitive rates paid on those deposits throughout the entire year  tempered the overall drop in average deposit costs 
in the first half of  management anticipates deposit costs to remain near current levels as competitors pricing of deposits and customer s alternative investment opportunities may limit peoples ability to further reduce funding costs from deposit products 
in addition to traditional deposits  peoples utilizes a variety of borrowings  both short term and long term  as complementary funding sources 
total borrowed funds averaged million in  down million or from the prior year s average and the cost of peoples borrowed funds fell basis points during the same period  due to the repayment of higher cost borrowings 
peoples primary source of borrowed funds is short and long term advances from the fhlb 
the short term fhlb advances are primarily libor based advances while the long term fhlb advances consist largely of year borrowings with initial fixed rate periods 
after the initial fixed rate period  the fhlb has the option to convert each advance to a libor based  variable rate advance  but peoples may repay the advance  without a penalty  if the fhlb exercises its option 
in  peoples short term fhlb borrowings averaged million  at a cost of  compared to million and an average cost of in average long term fhlb borrowings were up million or to million in while the average cost dropped basis points to 
in  peoples converted a portion of its short term fhlb advances to long term advances to secure lower rate  longer term funding 
management will continue to use a variety of fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth  when deemed appropriate 
peoples cash management services offered to a variety of business customers also provide short term funding  primarily in the form of overnight repurchase agreements 
overnight repurchase agreements excluding balances of wholesale market term repurchase agreements averaged million  a decrease of million or  from last year s average of million 
the average rate paid on overnight repurchase agreements was in  down basis points from the prior year  due to decreases in the market index tied to these accounts 
the decreased volume of repurchase agreements in is due largely to a withdrawal of a significant balance by a client who opted for an alternative investment product 
peoples also periodically accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify short term funding sources 
in  wholesale market term repurchase agreements averaged million at a rate of  down from million and an average rate of in peoples reduced the balance of these agreements throughout the year due to the availability and attractiveness of other funding sources and at december   had no wholesale market repurchase agreements outstanding 
however  management has again accessed this funding source in the first quarter of to fund asset growth and may continue to access such funding in the future  as deemed appropriate 
while peoples has benefited from the federal reserve s rate cuts in  management has shifted its focus to securing longer term funding as a means of reducing its liability sensitivity and anticipates the current demand to refinance loans to remain strong 
the combination of these factors could apply downward pressure on net interest income and net interest margin in the first half of although management continually works to mitigate the impact of these factors  peoples net interest margin and income remains difficult to predict  and to manage  in volatile interest rate environments 
provision for loan losses peoples provision for loan losses totaled  in  compared to  a year ago 
the increased provision is based upon management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy for loan losses and factors affecting loan losses 
management believes the current provision is appropriate for the quality  inherent risk  and volume concentrations of peoples loan portfolio 
while the overall quality of peoples loan portfolio remains strong  management anticipates that the provision for the first quarter of will increase marginally compared to recent quarters due in part to the overdraft privilege program 
ultimately  the provision will increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of peoples formal analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
further information can be found later in this discussion under allowance for loan losses 
gains and or losses on securities transactions gains on securities transactions  net of losses  totaled  compared to  in the net gains on securities transactions in both and resulted from normal portfolio activity 
gains and or losses on asset disposals net gains on asset disposals totaled  for the year ended december   compared to net losses of  in the same period last year 
the gains in were the result of asset disposals in conjunction with normal asset replacement  while net losses in resulted from peoples investment in a larger central processing unit in the second quarter of this investment has enhanced peoples processing capabilities and improved client service through more timely delivery of products and services 
mark to market adjustment on interest rate caps on january   peoples adopted statement of financial accounting standards number accounting for derivative instruments and hedging instruments sfas no 
 as required 
as a result of this adoption  peoples recognized the change in market value of certain interest rate contracts as an increase or decrease to income 
in  the net mark to market adjustment was  reducing net income by  or per share 
management does not anticipate any additional adjustments related to peoples existing interest rate cap contracts 
non interest income peoples generates non interest income from four primary sources deposit account service charges  fiduciary activities  investment and insurance commissions  and electronic banking 
for the year ended december   non interest income excluding non operating gains and losses increased  or to  compared to the same period last year 
increased electronic banking income and deposit account service charges  as well as peoples mid boli investment  were significant factors in improved non interest revenue 
non interest income was also positively impacted by non recurring revenue of  recorded in the fourth quarter of related to stock peoples received from the demutualization of anthem insurance companies  inc fee income generated from deposits represents the largest component of peoples non interest income 
deposit account service charge income totaled  in versus  a year ago  an increase of  or attributable to higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient fund fees 
in late  peoples began offering overdraft privilege to qualified non business clients  which increased deposit account services charges 
due in part to this program  overdraft fees were up in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in management anticipates that the overdraft privilege program will produce significant revenue growth in electronic banking is one of peoples many delivery channels for providing products and services to its clients and includes atm and debit card services  direct deposit services and internet banking 
electronic banking revenues grew  or in from s total of  due to volume increases in debit card usage by clients and additional clients utilizing peoples e banking services 
management will continue to explore and develop new e banking capabilities that complement existing delivery channels  both traditional and non traditional  and produce additional sources of revenue 
peoples other significant non interest income sources  insurance and investment commissions and fiduciary revenues  totaled  and  respectively  in compared to  and  respectively  in in  peoples experienced significant brokerage and annuity sales that were not at the time expected to continue in  however  peoples ability to maintain these revenue levels in was challenged more than expected as a result of the weak us stock market and general economic conditions 
management continues to pursue new ways to provide asset and risk management products to peoples clients and prospects and believes the associated revenues will be a significant source of future non interest income growth 
non interest expense one of peoples goals in was to manage the growth of non interest expense without sacrificing client service or slowing expansion into non traditional products and services 
in  non interest expense totaled  up  or compared to the prior year 
increased salaries expense and benefit costs accounted for most of the expense growth in salaries and benefits continue to be peoples largest component of non interest expense  which is inherent in a service based industry such as financial services 
compared to  salaries and benefits grew  or to  for the year ended december  rising medical costs and benefit expenses  as well as routine salary increases  wage adjustments necessary to retain and recruit key personnel  and the addition of associates  accounted for this increase 
at year end  peoples had full time equivalent associates compared to at year end management will continue to leverage peoples resources  while retaining and recruiting key associates  to effectively optimize customer service 
peoples also experienced modest increases in amortization of intangible assets  data processing and software costs  as well as higher levels of non income based taxes 
in  peoples had amortization expense related to intangible assets of  up  or due primarily to an acquisition in the first quarter of data processing and software costs totaled  compared to  last year  an increase of  or  as a result of a one time software licensing fee paid in late due to higher equity levels  non income based taxes grew  or to  in peoples other major areas of non interest expense were at or below their levels of recent periods 
management uses the non interest income leverage ratio to measure efficiency and peoples performance 
the ratio is defined as non interest income as a percentage of operating expenses  excludes securities and asset disposal gains and losses and intangible asset amortization 
in  peoples non interest income leverage ratio was compared to in enhanced deposit account service charges  as well as the new revenue streams generated from peoples boli investment and income relating to the anthem demutualization accounted for a majority of the improvement 
management continues to implement strategies aimed at producing additional non interest income and improving peoples non interest income leverage ratio 
return on equity peoples return on equity roe was in versus in on a cash basis  tangible roe was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in peoples roe has been negatively impacted in by the mark to market adjustment on peoples available for sale investment portfolio that resulted in an increase in equity 
as market interest rates change  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are sensitive to the corresponding change in the overall market value of the investment portfolio 
since roe enhancement during the first half of will be limited due to current market conditions  management continues to focus on earnings per share eps as the most meaningful measurement of short term performance 
return on assets return on assets roa in was  up from a year ago 
removing the impact of intangibles and related amortization expense  tangible roa was versus in in recent years  the primary focus of both the investment community and management has shifted to eps enhancement and roe while diminishing the emphasis on roa as a key performance indicator 
despite the reduced emphasis  management continues to monitor roa and considers it a measurement of peoples asset leverage 
management expects any enhancement to roa in to be minimal 
income tax expense in  peoples continued to make tax advantaged investments  including investments in low income housing tax credit funds and the purchase of boli 
peoples effective tax rate was in versus last year 
at december   peoples investment in tax credit funds and low income housing approximated million compared to million at year end these additional investments are expected to reduce peoples income tax expense in the future 
depending on economic and regulatory conditions  peoples may make additional investments in various tax credit pools over the next several years that could impact peoples effective tax rate and overall tax burden 
overview of balance sheet total assets were billion at december   an increase of million or compared to year end gross loans increased million or to million  with growth occurring in commercial and real estate loans 
peoples also purchased million of boli in mid using accumulated funds from investment runoff and other sources  which accounts for most of the increase in other assets 
the boli investment produces a tax advantaged revenue stream that enhances peoples operating efficiency by offsetting rising employee benefit costs 
liabilities totaled billion at year end compared to billion a year ago  an increase of million or 
peoples total deposits grew million or from million at december  interest bearing balances were up million or to million at december  while non interest bearing deposits increased million or to million 
during  the amount of borrowed funds declined from million at december   to million at year end stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million or 
the higher level of equity in is due in part to a positive change in market value of peoples available for sale investment securities 
the remaining increase in equity was a result of increased earnings  net of dividends paid 
cash and cash equivalents peoples cash and cash equivalents are federal funds sold  cash and balances due from banks  and interest bearing balances in other institutions 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to client activity and peoples liquidity needs 
at year end  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up million or compared to december  this change is due largely to additional items in process of collection  which resulted in higher balances due from banks at year end 
at december   peoples had federal funds sold of  compared to no federal funds sold at december   also contributing to the overall increase in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  along with the availability of other funding sources  should allow peoples to meet cash obligations  special needs and off balance sheet commitments as they come due 
management will actively manage the principal runoff from the investment and loan portfolios and reinvest those funds based on loan demand and investment opportunities  as appropriate  while monitoring the level of cash and cash equivalents to ensure funds are appropriately deployed while maintaining adequate liquidity 
investment securities at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million  down from million at year end  while the market value of the investment portfolio was virtually unchanged 
in the first half of  management redeployed a portion of principal runoff resulting in a decrease in amortized cost  however  this decline was partially offset by market value increases attributable to interest rate fluctuations 
management initiated a plan in late to return the investment portfolio to previous levels in anticipation of flat to modest loan growth in the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding increase in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
in comparison  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized depreciation of million and a decrease in equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
peoples investment in mortgage backed securities comprised a significant portion of peoples investment portfolio  with a total market value of million  up million or from year end investments in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies totaled million at year end compared to million at december  peoples investment in obligations of state and political subdivisions and all other securities totaled million and million  respectively  increases of million or and million or  respectively 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the alco also monitors net interest income  sets pricing guidelines  and manages peoples interest rate risk 
through active management of the balance sheet and investment portfolio  peoples maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor demand  other company liquidity requirements and various credit needs of its customers 
management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable 
loans peoples bank primarily focuses on lending opportunities in central and southeastern ohio  northern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets  especially retail lending  which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer lending 
at december   gross loans totaled million  an increase of million or since year end most of the growth in occurred in commercial  financial and agricultural loans commercial loans  however  loans acquired as part of an acquisition in the first quarter of  which were primarily retail loans  also contributed to loan growth 
commercial loan growth occurred primarily in peoples existing markets and through loan participation relationships  while some lending activity involved selected customers outside peoples primary markets 
at december   commercial loans increased million or from year end s balance of million  with a majority of the increase occurring in the fourth quarter of commercial loans represent the largest portion of peoples total loan portfolio  comprising of total loans at december   versus at december  future commercial lending activities will depend on economic and related conditions  such as general demand for loans in peoples primary markets and interest rates offered by peoples 
in addition to in market opportunities  peoples will continue to selectively lend to creditworthy customers outside its primary markets 
real estate loans including construction loans grew million or compared to year end  with total balances of million at december  real estate loans comprise of peoples total loan portfolio at year end versus a year ago 
included in real estate loans are home equity credit lines equilines  which totaled million at the end of compared to million at december  management believes equiline loans are a relationship product with an acceptable return on investment after risk considerations 
residential real estate loans continue to represent a major focus of peoples lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan  and the opportunity to provide additional products and services to these consumers  at reasonable risk return ratios to peoples 
consumer lending continues to be a vital part of peoples core lending 
excluding credit card balances  consumer loans decreased million or to million since year end the indirect lending area represents the majority of peoples consumer loans  with balances of million 
indirect loan balances have declined million or from million at year end  a result of declining creditworthy indirect sales opportunities  normal runoff of indirect loans  and especially automobile manufacturers offering attractive financing options to car buyers in late management is pleased with the performance of peoples consumer loan portfolio  which can be attributed to a commitment to sound lending practices and a strong customer service orientation 
lenders use a tiered pricing system that enables peoples to apply interest rates based on the corresponding risk associated with the loan 
although consumer debt delinquency has increased in the financial services industry  management s actions to reinforce peoples pricing system and underwriting criteria have had a positive impact on consumer loan delinquencies 
management plans to continue its commitment to the use of this tiered pricing system to improve the performance of peoples consumer loan portfolio and promote controlled growth of quality consumer loans 
peoples credit card balances totaled million at december   down million or since december  management routinely evaluates new opportunities to serve credit card customers and grow the credit card balance 
management does not intend to subject peoples to additional and or unnecessary risk merely for such growth and considers peoples credit cards to be a complementary product offering for client relationships 
loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans are credits to lodging and lodging related companies  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   compared to at december  loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes also represent a significant portion of peoples commercial loans accounting for of peoples outstanding commercial loans at year end versus at year end these lending opportunities have arisen due to the growth of these industries in certain markets or contiguous areas  as well as sales associates efforts to develop these key relationships 
management believes peoples loans to lodging and lodging related companies  as well as loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  do not pose abnormal risk when compared to risk assumed in other types of lending 
management is confident peoples has sufficient knowledge of these industries to make sound underwriting decisions 
allowance for loan losses management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  and allocation of the allowance among loan types 
the portion of the allowance allocated among the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of loans 
the individual loan reviews are based upon specific qualitative and quantitative criteria  including the size of the loan and loan grades below a predetermined level 
the historical experience factors are based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  credit cards  personal loans  etc 
are collectively evaluated based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each particular lending markets 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s historical effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
peoples recorded a provision for loan losses of  in   in and  in based upon management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and factors affecting loan losses 
factors contributing to the increased allowance for loan loss and related provision in included higher loss experience  loan balances and continued growth of higher risk commercial loans 
when expressed as a percentage of average loans  the provision has been  and  and net chargeoffs amounted to  and in  and  respectively 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the loan categories 
this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly procedural discipline described above 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category and is allocated as follows at december percent percent percent of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each category category category to total to total to total dollars in thousands amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial    real estate    consumer    credit card general risk total    the higher allocations for commercial loans reflect the increased credit risk associated with this type of lending and are also driven by the continued growth in this portfolio 
in and  the commercial loan balance grew by and  respectively  over the prior year balance 
other factors considered by peoples in determining the allocations to the commercial portfolios were the concentration of credit risk in single borrowers and the specific allocation for individual lending relationships 
the allowance allocation for the real estate and consumer loan portfolio is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous loans  and increases or decreases in loan balances for real estate and consumer loans 
as a result of changes in economic conditions and the recessionary environment in late  peoples refined its systematic methodology in the determination of the allowance for loan losses to specific loans or groups 
as a result  the allocation for general credit risk has been assigned to loss factors developed from historical data to make them more representative of those which may be expected in the current economic environment 
in  net chargeoffs totaled  compared to  in commercial and consumer loans comprised a majority of net chargeoffs  totaling  and  respectively  in versus  and  respectively  in real estate chargeoffs represented a small percentage of total net chargeoffs for the year ended december  and  reflecting the quality of the real estate loan portfolio 
peoples nonperforming assets which include loans days or more past due  nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  and other real estate owned were up marginally from year end at december   nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets  versus million  or  a year ago 
management continues to review the entire loan portfolio as part of the risk management process and has confidence in peoples loan review programs and the level of peoples allowance for loan losses  which stands at of nonperforming loans  and of total loans  at year end at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired was million of which million was accruing interest  and million were nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount are million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses is million 
the remaining impaired loan balances do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses as a result of previous write downs  being well secured  or possessing characteristics indicative of ability to repay the loan 
for the year ended december   the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million and interest income of  was recognized on impaired loans during the period  representing of peoples total interest income 
funding sources peoples considers a number of sources when evaluating its funding needs  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling million  or of total funding sources at december  non interest bearing deposits serve as a core funding source 
at year end  non interest bearing balances totaled million  an million or increase compared to the prior year end 
in the fourth quarter of  peoples implemented two programs aimed at attracting new clients and core deposits  as well as producing additional non interest income opportunities overdraft privilege and free checking 
these programs have already had a positive impact through the addition of new deposits 
management expects these programs to produce additional benefits in in addition  management will continue to focus on expanding its base of lower cost funding sources and enhancing client relationships by providing incentives for clients to utilize more of peoples products and services 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at december  certificates of deposits account for the majority of peoples interest bearing deposits  increasing million or since year end to million at december  interest bearing transaction accounts  comprised primarily of peoples money market deposit accounts  also contributed to the overall increased level of interest bearing deposits totaling million at december   up million or compared to million at year end peoples money market accounts offer variable  competitive rates that allow clients flexibility and opportunity to enhance their investment yields 
peoples also accesses other funding sources  including short term and long term advances  to fund asset growth and satisfy liquidity needs 
advances from fhlb and repurchase agreements comprise peoples short term borrowings  while long term borrowings are primarily year fhlb advances  with initial fixed rate features for periods of two  three  or four years  depending on the specific advance 
each advance has the opportunity  at the discretion of the fhlb  to reprice after its initial fixed rate period  and peoples has the option to prepay any repriced advance without penalty  or allow the borrowing to reprice to a libor based  variable product 
at december   long term borrowings were up million or compared to year end  totaling million at december  since year end  peoples short term borrowings declined million or to million at december  these changes are the result of peoples shift to longer term funding to lock in costs during this period of low interest rates 
this shift includes the conversion of a significant portion of peoples short term fhlb borrowings to long term borrowings 
management plans to access fhlb borrowings both long and short term as an appropriate funding source 
capital stockholders equity at december   stockholders equity was million  an increase of million or since december   as changes in the market value of peoples investment portfolio and increased earnings directly impacted peoples stockholders equity 
in  peoples had net income of  and paid dividends of  a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to a ratio of a year ago 
management believes recent dividends represent an acceptable payout ratio for peoples and anticipates similar payout ratios in future periods through quarterly dividends 
the adjustment for the net unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities  net of deferred income taxes  totaled million at year end versus holding losses of million at december   a change of million 
since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments 
management believes peoples capital continues to provide a strong base for profitable growth 
peoples had treasury stock totaling million compared to million at year end during  peoples repurchased  common shares authorized under formal treasury share purchase plans at an average price of per share 
peoples issued approximately  shares through various stock option plans  deferred compensation plans and the dividend reinvestment program 
in  peoples may repurchase additional shares under the stock repurchase program based on timing and prices management deems appropriate until its expiration on december  in addition to monitoring performance through traditional capital measurements ie  dividend payout ratios and roe  peoples has also complied with the capital adequacy standards mandated by the banking industry 
peoples and peoples bank have complied with these requirements and were considered well capitalized institutions at december  detailed information concerning peoples risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the objective of peoples asset liability management function is to optimize and protect net interest income within peoples policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through management of peoples balance sheet mix  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure based on changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk one of the most significant risks resulting from peoples normal business of extending loans and accepting deposits is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples management has charged the alco with the overall management of peoples balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions related to the management of irr 
the alco strives to keep peoples focused on the future  anticipating and exploring alternatives  rather than simply reacting to change 
to this end  the alco has established an irr management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of the irr policy is to encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing irr including simulating net interest income  monitoring the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity  and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of irr because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures and by establishing limits on these estimated changes in net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate the risks expected  based on the simulation data  associated with alternative strategies 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation that represents the current balance sheet 
base case simulation results are prepared under an assumed flat interest rate scenario and at least two alternative interest rate scenarios  one rising and one declining  assuming parallel yield curve parameters 
comparisons showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet strategy 
when deemed appropriate  additional balance sheet strategies are developed and simulations prepared 
these additional simulations are run with the same interest rate scenarios used with the base case simulation and or using different yield curves 
the additional strategies are used to measure yield curve risk  prepayment risk  basis risk  and index lag risk inherent in the balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case provide the alco with information concerning the risks associated with implementing the alternative strategies produced from the simulation data 
the results from model simulations are reviewed for indications of effectiveness of current irr strategies 
peoples monitors irr for both the short and long term 
therefore  to effectively evaluate results from model simulations  limits on changes in net interest income and the value of the balance sheet have been established 
to monitor the short term exposure to irr  the alco limited the earnings at risk of peoples bank to or less from base case for each basis point shift in interest rates measured on an annual basis 
to monitor long term exposure  management has limited the negative impact on net equity value to or less when interest rates shift basis points 
for an assessment of the current interest rate risk position  the alco reviews static gap measures for specific time periods focusing on one year cumulative gap 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets 
the following table is provided to illustrate the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples at december  dollars in thousands immediate interest rate estimated estimated increase decrease in decrease increase decrease increase in basis points in net interest income economic value of equity the interest risk analysis shows that peoples is moderately liability sensitive  which means that downward moving interest rates should favorably impact peoples net interest income while upward moving interest rates should negatively impact net interest income 
as a result  the alco may consider the purchase of interest rate hedge instruments  as available and appropriate  that would provide net interest income protection in a rising rate environment 
peoples liability sensitivity reflects a moderate decrease from year end due in part to the alco s continuing efforts to secure long term funding in the current low interest rate environment 
the interest rate analysis also shows peoples is within the established irr policy limits for all simulations and all scenarios for the current period as well as at all measured points during the preceding year 
liquidity in addition to irr management  a primary objective of the alco is the maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand  and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources 
the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided from cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  principal payments and income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled million as increases in deposits and long term borrowings were partially offset by a decrease in short term borrowings 
cash flows used in investing activity totaled million  due to a net increase in loan balances and other investing activities such as the boli purchase 
when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable peoples to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
securities in the investment portfolio that are available for sale can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile liabilities  short term growth in deposits and brokered funds  from liquid assets  short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
at december   peoples net liquidity position was million  or of total assets  in comparison to a net liquidity position of million  or of total assets  at december  the increase in liquidity is attributed to an increase in liquid assets  which include federal funds sold and investment securities  and an increase in what peoples considers stable deposits during the liquidity position as of year end was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of the peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets 
future outlook peoples achieved several key goals in including double digit earnings growth and top line revenue generation despite a slower than expected first half of the year and challenging economic conditions throughout the year 
future success in the financial service industry will revolve around three issues earnings growth and quality  asset quality  capital quality 
management believes that peoples is sound in all of these areas  as reflected by the strong results in  due largely to solid asset liability management and underwriting  as well as diversified revenue streams 
in  management will work to build upon existing client relationship and continue to explore new opportunities  which will position peoples for the future of financial services 
the introduction of the overdraft privilege program and free checking in late have already produced positive benefits because of the aggressive marketing of these products in each market peoples serves 
in  management expects these initiatives to boost non interest revenues  particularly deposit account service charges and overdraft fees  by as much as and modestly increase the level of peoples core deposits 
management s focus will be to expand on these new relationships and revenue opportunities created by these programs  through an integrated  needs based sales process 
e banking remains a key focal point for management as more and more clients enjoy the benefits of peoples award winning e banking services that include internet banking through peoples online connection  atms and telebank capabilities 
peoples investment in technology in recent periods is aligned with the strategy to provide the core of its business  those clients who complete thousands of transactions each week in their deposit and loan accounts  with speedy  technologically superior services that make it easier to do business with peoples 
in  peoples will strive to continue to improve its e banking services by exploring the possibility of offering account aggregation capabilities also known as screen scraping technology as part of peoples e services 
this service would give peoples clients the ability to manage a real time consolidated view of all their financial accounts at all financial institutions on one active web page as long as the financial institutions are web enabled 
the cost of this capability has dropped in recent months  and management will determine if this technology and its capabilities makes strategic sense for peoples client base 
even while management grows peoples operations and client base through new products and services  the strong capital levels that exist afford peoples the opportunity to grow and expand through strategic mergers and acquisitions  such as the first colony acquisition 
management believes the first colony acquisition will produce immediate benefits to peoples operating results  as well as provide new opportunities as peoples integrates its non traditional products and services such as insurance and investments with the traditional banking products currently offered to clients in the new markets 
management continues to explore merger and acquisition prospects in and around peoples current footprint 
however  the evaluation of future acquisitions will focus more on enhancing peoples earnings potential rather than geographic location or proximity to current markets and ultimately  will depend upon opportunities that complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent 
in the last several years  peoples has completed several acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  which added goodwill balances to peoples balance sheet and amortization expense to results of operations 
on january   new accounting rules took effect that eliminated the amortization expense on a portion of peoples intangible assets 
if the new rules had been in effect in  peoples goodwill amortization expense would have been reduced by  and diluted eps would have been approximately versus the reported 
in  management anticipates that the new accounting rules will have a similar impact 
late in the fourth quarter of  peoples completed the formation of new capital management subsidiaries peoples investment company and peoples capital corporation 
these new subsidiaries will allow management to better manage peoples investments and provide new opportunities to make investments  including  but not limited to  low income housing tax credit funds  that are either limited or restricted at the bank level 
the goal is to invest peoples capital across business units  based on projected risk and return on investments  which have potential for both strong growth and enhancement to peoples overall long term value 
management expects that these subsidiaries will also provide opportunities to reduce peoples overall tax burden both income based and non income based while helping to optimize peoples operational effectiveness 
in  peoples issued million of trust preferred securities through pebo capital trust i  which boosted capital ratios to even stronger levels 
in the first quarter of  peoples took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase million of its trust preferred  at a discount  in open market transactions and as a result  will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately  or approximately per share after tax  in its results of operations for the first quarter of management is evaluating opportunities to participate in a pooled trusted preferred offering in late first quarter or early second quarter of this source of funds will likely be a variable rate  libor based product and will help maintain capital ratios  fuel growth plans  and initially lower peoples funding costs from its current fixed rate of 
it is peoples goal to be a complete financial services provider to clients 
to that end  management will continue to evaluate possible customer relationship management crm information systems and processes in that will enhance client contact management  data mining  profitability information  and marketing 
in addition  management expects to gain a better understanding of client dynamics and the value proposition peoples can offer to each client through crm 
management believes an investment in a crm system is a necessary step to continue the development and growth of peoples sales culture and measurement systems 
management plans to have due diligence completed in the first quarter of  with the goal of making decisions in the second quarter of regarding investments and other resources necessary to create a corporate wide process that promotes profitable sales growth 
management is excited by the possibilities that a complete crm process will provide  and looks forward to implementation and enhancements that will follow 
peoples earnings momentum strengthened throughout and management believes it will continue into the first half of peoples focus remains long term and strategies linked to filling the financial needs of every client through an integrated  seamless service process  regardless of economic conditions 
in  management s goals remain unchanged and centered around producing long term financial benefits for every stakeholder integrating traditional and non traditional products and services  enhancing non interest revenues  and controlling operating expenses 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this form k which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  the effect of federal and state banking and tax regulations  the effect of technological changes  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  and other risks detailed in peoples securities and exchange commission filings 
although management believes the expectations in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of management s knowledge of peoples business and operations  it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these projections

net interest income totaled million  up compared to  as total interest income reached million and interest expense totaled million 
net interest margin decreased in to from in net interest margin decreased in due to interest rate compression between loan pricing and funding source costs 
peoples yield on earning assets improved basis points in to  but the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during the same period 
peoples provision for loan losses totaled  in  up compared to s expense of  the combination of increased loan volume  less favorable loss experience  and a general economic slowdown resulted in the increased provision in at december   peoples allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  compared to a year end ratio of 
non interest income from operations excluding securities and asset disposal transactions totaled  in  an increase of compared to in  deposit account service charge income increased  or compared to  in  due to higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient fund fees 
income from fiduciary activities totaled  down compared to electronic banking income grew in from  the prior year 
electronic banking income increased primarily due to growth in the number of debit card users and the associated volume increases in debit card usage 
as a result of increased life insurance and annuity sales  insurance and investment commissions were up in from  in for the year ended december   non interest expense totaled million  up million or compared to in  peoples implemented several strategic initiatives that resulted in higher levels of non interest expense 
salaries and benefits totaled million in  an increase of compared to million the prior year 
furniture and equipment expenses were up million to million in  while net occupancy expense grew million to million compared to the previous year 
these increases can be attributed primarily to the depreciation of the assets acquired through investments and business acquisitions aimed at making financial services more convenient and flexible 
peoples other non interest expenses were near prior period levels 
total assets reached billion at december   up million compared to year end asset growth can be attributed primarily to strong loan growth throughout loans continued to be peoples largest earning asset component and increased million compared to year end  totaling million at year end while each of peoples loan categories experienced strong growth  a majority of the increase occurred in the commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
average loans totaled of average deposits in  up from at year end peoples other significant earning asset component is the investment securities portfolio  which totaled million at year end  up million from year end although peoples utilized a variety of funding sources  traditional deposits continued to be the most significant source of funds totaling million  or of peoples funding sources at december  in additional to traditional deposits  peoples accessed both short term and long term borrowings to fund operations and investments 
short term borrowings totaled million at year end  up million since year end short term fhlb advances and national market repurchase agreements were accessed heavily at year end to fund peoples yk cash reserves 
peoples repaid those borrowings in early and continued to access those funding sources at various times to balance liquidity needs and fund loan growth 
at december   long term borrowings totaled million compared to million a year earlier  a result of peoples repaying million of fhlb borrowings in mid total stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase was the result of market value increases in peoples investment portfolio and the reissuance of treasury shares in conjunction with the stock dividend in the first quarter of at december   the adjustment for the net unrealized holding loss on available for sale securities totaled million  a change of million from the previous year
