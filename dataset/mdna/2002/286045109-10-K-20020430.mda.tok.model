the primary reason for the decrease in accounts payable from the prior year is due to additional payments being made in january as a result of the week fiscal year and our election to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by some of our vendors 
we made capital expenditures of million in fiscal  primarily to open new stores  to remodel existing stores  to purchase and install a new inventory system in the louisville distribution center and to renovate and expand the pennsylvania corporate headquarters 
in fiscal  we also made investments of million to acquire various assets and businesses in several european countries including retail stores  distribution centers  and mail order and internet businesses

on march   our predecessor  the electronics boutique  inc eb  entered into a credit agreement with fleet capital corporation  pursuant to which fleet agreed to make available an asset based revolving credit and term loan facility in an amount up to million 
the revolving credit facility was assigned to electronics boutique by eb 
the revolving credit facility was renewed for a one year term expiring on march  interest accrues on borrowings at a per annum rate equal to either libor plus basis points or fleet s base rate of interest  at our option 
the revolving credit facility is secured by certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  fixtures and equipment 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
letters of credit outstanding with various financial institutions were million at february  we believe that cash generated from our operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations and store expansion programs for the next fiscal year 
related party transactions transactions with affiliates in fiscal  eb entered into a services agreement with eb uk to provide consulting  management  training  and advertising assistance  which expires on january  the agreement was assigned to eb services company  llp eb services 
the agreement prohibits eb services from competing in the united kingdom or ireland during the term of the agreement  and for one year after its termination

management fees received from eb uk for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was   and  respectively 
additionally  the agreement provides that eb services is to be reimbursed by eb uk for all reasonable travel and subsistence expenses incurred during performance of the agreement 
at february  and february   there were no outstanding balances due from eb uk 
currently eb and eb services are defendants in a lawsuit pending before the chancery division of the high court of justice in the united kingdom filed by eb uk on march  eb uk claims that  as result of certain events  including our august secondary offering  a change in control has occurred allowing it to terminate the services agreement between eb services and eb uk prior to its expiration in no monetary damages are being sought by eb uk 
we believe we have meritorious defenses against the suit and intend to defend the suit vigorously 
however  if eb uk prevails and terminates the services agreement  our earnings could be significantly impacted 
in june  we purchased our headquarters and its primary distribution center  which are located in a single  square foot building on several acres in west chester  pennsylvania  from eb nevada inc for  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet certain criteria to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill and should be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
our adoption of statement in fiscal did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of february   we had net unamortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  all of which will be subject to the annual impairment test 
million of the net goodwill and intangible assets were from previous year s activity and the remaining million relates to international acquisitions in fiscal amortization of goodwill was  in fiscal we are currently assessing the impact of statement  which will be adopted in fiscal in august  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement establishes standards for accounting for an obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived asset 
the statement is effective for our fiscal year ending january  we are finalizing our review of this statement and are not expecting a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides guidance for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year ending february  we are finalizing our review of this statement and are not expecting a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significiant accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statement note 
we consider the following policies to be most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined principally by a weighted average method 
the weighted average cost method attaches a cost to each stock keeping unit sku and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that sku 
inherent in the video game business is the risk of obsolete inventory 
as the new generation of products is introduced  demand for the prior generation decreases  thus reducing interest and value of the older games 
some vendors offer us credit to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
we monitor the aging of our inventory by item and provide a reserve for product that is considered slow moving  using an established formula based on current inventory and a trailing sales history 
we also monitor the difference between the selling market price of each item and its cost and provide a reserve for any differences below such cost 
we perform regular physical inventories and cycle counts in both our stores and distribution centers to adjust inventory balances and account for shrink and damaged product 
an accrual for estimated loss is recorded between the timing of these counts 
reserves of  and  were recorded against inventory as of february  and february   respectively 
management believes its inventory valuation system results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
revenue recognition and related policies we derive revenue primarily from two sources i product revenue  which includes the retail sale of merchandise inventory  warranties  and shipping and handling fees and ii management services revenue 
sales are recorded net of estimated amounts for sales returns and other allowances 
retail sales are recognized as revenue at the point of sale 
mail order and internet sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment 
revenues from shipping and handling are recorded in revenue and recognized upon shipment 
warranty revenue is amortized over the life of the warranty contract 
we also engage in the sale and trading of pre owned video game products 
credit is issued for the assigned value of the pre owned products accepted for trade against the purchase of other products 
this treatment results in the reporting of lower revenue and cost of goods sold 
however  there is no impact on gross profit 
revenues for management services are recorded as earned 
in fiscal  all management fees earned were derived under a services agreement with eb uk 
restructuring costs we announced our plan to close all of our eb kids stores and sell our store bc sports collectibles business 
we plan to offer alternative job opportunities to associates who may be displaced as a result of these actions 
it is expected that a number of the eb kids stores will be converted to the electronics boutique format 
the converting of the eb kids stores to the electronics boutique format or closing of the remaining stores is expected to be completed by june  we have retained a financial advisor to assist in the sale of the bc sports collectibles business and expects to complete a transaction by the end of the second fiscal quarter 
we continue to operate and incur expenses while we seek a purchaser of these stores 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to identify a purchaser and close a sale to that purchaser within this  or any  time frame 
as a result of these decisions  we recorded a million pre tax charge in the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended february   consisting of the write down of fixed assets and inventory  estimated lease termination costs  and related expenses 
to determine the charge  management made various estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of fixed assets and inventories  as well as estimating the costs associated with terminating certain leases 
actual costs could differ from these estimates 
if this occurs  we will adjust our accrual accordingly 
income taxes we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions  including the us  states and localities  and internationally 
income taxes are calculated in accordance with statement of financial standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the management of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations 
significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs  income and expense recognization and inventory valuation methods 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish valuation allowance 
we have valuation allowances of  as of february   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utlize the net operating loss carry forwards of certain foreign subsidiaries 
future tax expense may be impacted by this judgment 
contractual obligations we have certain commitments under operating leases which are disclosed in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  for information on debt and lines of credit  see footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term investment grade securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either the bank s base rate or libor plus basis points  at our option 
we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility as of february  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
we have retail operations in various foreign countries including canada  australia  new zealand  korea  denmark  norway  italy  germany and sweden 
we are subject to currency exchange rate and currency devaluation risks due to these operations 
since approximately of our net sales are domestic  we do not believe that currency exchange rate fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we routinely enter into forward and cross currency swap exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage its exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans  investments in subsidiaries  and accounts payable 
as of february   we have foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million and cross currency swap contracts with a notional amount of million 
the total fair market value of all contracts is approximately  three contracts for million expire during fiscal and the remaining contracts for million expire in future years 
we intend to monitor our exposure to these risks and re evaluate our hedging strategies as appropriate
