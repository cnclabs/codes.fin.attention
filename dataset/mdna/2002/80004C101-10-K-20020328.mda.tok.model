overview sandisk was founded in to develop and market flash data storage systems 
we sell our products to the consumer electronics and industrial communications markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our product sales were attributable to the consumer electronics market  particularly sales of compactflash and smartmedia card products for use in digital camera applications 
our compactflash products have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity flashdisk and flashdrive products 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products are sold into the retail channel  which usually has shorter customer order lead times than our other channels 
a majority of our sales to the retail channel are turns business  with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  thereby decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production needs 
we believe sales to the consumer market will continue to represent a substantial majority of our sales  and may increase as a percentage of sales in future years  as the popularity of consumer applications  including digital cameras  increases 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the volume of product sales  competitive pricing pressures  availability of foundry capacity  variations in manufacturing cycle times  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing utilization  the timing of significant orders  our ability to match supply with demand  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  the timing of license and royalty revenues  fluctuations in product costs  increased research and development expenses  and exchange rate fluctuations 
we have experienced seasonality in the past 
as the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics applications increases  our revenues may become increasingly subject to seasonal increases in the fourth quarter of each year and declines in the first quarter of the following year 
see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our stock price and there is seasonality in our business 
beginning in late  we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash technology  including our patent portfolio  to third party manufacturers of flash products 
to date  we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several companies  and intend to pursue opportunities to enter into additional licenses 
under our current license agreements  licensees pay license fees  royalties  or a combination thereof 
in some cases  the compensation to us may be partially in the form of guaranteed access to flash memory manufacturing capacity from the licensee company 
the timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
as a result  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues  gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues 
we market our products using a direct sales organization  distributors  manufacturers representatives  private label partners  oems and retailers 
in  retail sales accounted for of total product revenues  compared to in we expect that sales through the retail channel will comprise an increasing share of our product revenues in the future  and that a substantial portion of our sales into the retail channel will be made to participants that will have the right to return unsold products 
our policy is to defer recognition of revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the end customers 
historically  a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
sales to our top customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our product revenues for   and in and  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
in  revenues from one customer exceeded of our total revenues 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have also experienced significant changes in the composition of our customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to continue as market demand for our customers products fluctuates 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues 
all of our products require silicon wafers  the majority of which are currently manufactured for us by toshiba s wafer facility at yokkaichi  japan  under our joint venture agreement  as well as umc in taiwan 
industry wide demand for semiconductors decreased significantly in  due to decreased demand in the cellular phone markets and the broad  general economic downturn leading to a us recession 
semiconductor manufacturers  including some of our suppliers and competitors  added new advanced wafer fab capacity prior to the downturn 
this additional capacity  along with slowing economic conditions  resulted in excess supply and led to intense pricing pressure 
from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  the average sales price per megabyte we sold decreased by  far in excess of our ability to reduce our cost per megabyte 
consequently we saw a dramatic reduction in our product gross margins  which resulted in substantial operating losses in if industry wide demand for our products continues to be below the industry wide available supply  our product prices could decrease further causing our operating losses to continue in under our wafer supply agreements  there are limits on the number of wafers we can order and our ability to change that quantity  either up or down  is restricted 
accordingly  our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products is limited 
if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders for wafers or other long lead time items such as controller chips or printed circuit boards  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders  which could result in lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of flash memory wafers with acceptable prices and yields from our current and future wafer foundries  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we have from time to time taken write downs for excess or obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market price adjustments 
in  such write downs and lower of cost or market adjustments were approximately million 
we may be forced to take additional write downs for excess or obsolete inventory in future quarters if the current deterioration in market demand for our products continues and our inventory levels continue to exceed customer orders 
in addition  we may record additional lower of cost or market price adjustments to our inventories if continued pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost 
although we continuously try to reduce our inventory in line with the current level of business  we are obligated to honor existing purchase orders  which we have placed with our suppliers 
in the case of flashvision manufacturing  both we and toshiba are obligated to purchase their share of the production output  which makes it more difficult for us to reduce our inventory 
excess inventory not only ties up our cash  but also can result in substantial losses if such inventory  or large portions thereof  has to be revalued due to lower market pricing or product obsolescence 
these inventory adjustments decrease gross margins and in resulted in  and could in the future result in  fluctuations in gross margins and net earnings in the quarter in which they occur 
see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
export sales are an important part of our business  representing  and of our total revenues in   and  respectively 
our sales may be impacted by changes in economic conditions in our international markets 
economic conditions in our international markets  including japan  asia and the european union  may adversely affect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in these regions declines 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions which could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results our international operations make us vulnerable to changing conditions and currency fluctuations 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to realize a significant portion of our revenues from recently introduced and new products 
typically  new products initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation 
in addition  manufacturing yields are generally lower at the start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry 
in  we experienced start up costs of approximately million associated with ramping up nand wafer production at flashvision 
during the start up phase  the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers  making this output very expensive 
to remain competitive  we are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs  including development of future generations of nand flash memory 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop such products or processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs 
if the current industry wide and worldwide economic slowdown continues throughout fiscal  we may be unable to efficiently utilize the nand flash wafer production from flashvision  which would force us to amortize the fixed costs of the fabrication facility over a reduced wafer output  making these wafers significantly more expensive 
see factors that may affect future results we must achieve acceptable manufacturing yields 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognizes net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance if applicable  fixed pricing and probable collectibility 
because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry  sales made to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise 
customer incentives  returns and allowances 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including promotions and other volume based incentives  particularly for our retail customers  which represented of our product revenues in fourth quarter of if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings to our retail customers  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
in addition  we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due based on our historical experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
warranty costs 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs differ from our estimates  increases to our warranty liability would be required 
valuation of financial instruments 
our short term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
we also have equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies  umc of million and tower of million  as of december  in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost of these investments is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
due to the slowdown in the semiconductor industry and economic recession in  the market value of our umc and tower investments declined significantly 
these declines were deemed to be other than temporary and losses totaling were recognized 
if the slowdown in the semiconductor industry continues in  we may recognize additional losses on these investments 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  including assumptions about changes in average selling prices 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from our estimates deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million that has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
due to our current losses  we have not used projections of future taxable income in determining the amount of the valuation allowance required 
results of operations we operate in one business segment  flash memory products 
our products are sold throughout the world 
in the united states and foreign countries our products are sold through direct  oem  reseller  and distributor channels 
our chief decision maker  the president and chief executive officer  evaluate our performance based on total our results 
revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and product category 
separate financial information is not available by product category in regards to asset allocation  expense allocation  or profitability 
product revenues 
in  our product revenues were million  a decrease of from million in the decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the worldwide economy  industry wide excess supply of flash memory  and reduced demand from oem customers who were liquidating existing inventories throughout most of all of these factors reduced the demand for our products and resulted in intense pricing pressures causing the average selling price of our products to decline significantly 
in  the largest decline in revenues came from multimediacards  due to the slowdown in the market for digital music players and compactflash  due to the decline in average selling price 
in  our flash memory product unit sales declined and our average selling price per megabyte of flash memory shipped declined compared to however  the decline in average selling price per megabyte was even more severe  at  when comparing the fourth quarter of to the same period in in  our product revenues increased to million from million in the increase consisted of an increase of in unit sales  which was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices per unit 
in  the largest increase in unit volume came from sales of compactflash products that represented of product revenues and multimediacard products that represented of product revenues 
the continuing move towards higher capacity cards in partially offset a decline in the average selling price per megabyte of capacity shipped 
in  the average megabyte capacity per unit shipped increased while the average selling price per megabyte of flash memory shipped declined compared to the prior year 
our backlog as of december  was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction in orders from our oem customers and a significant reduction in order lead times due to industry wide overcapacity 
because of the deterioration in market conditions throughout most of  our quarterly turns business  the business we book and ship in the same quarter  reached approximately of our product shipments in the third and fourth quarters of in  oem sales decreased to of product revenues in  compared to in retail sales  which are typically booked and shipped in the same quarter  increased to of our product revenues  compared to in in the fourth quarter of  sales through our retail channels accounted for approximately of product revenues 
we expect sales to the retail channel to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue in see factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate significantly and there is seasonality in our business 
since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellations  backlog is not necessarily an indication of future revenue 
license and royalty revenues 
we currently earn patent license fees and royalties under several cross license agreements  including agreements with hitachi  intel  lexar  sharp  samsung  smartdisk  sony  sst  tdk and toshiba 
license and royalty revenues from patent cross license agreements were million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in license and royalty revenues in was primarily due to lower patent royalties from lower royalty bearing sales by some of our licensees resulting in decreased patent license revenues recognized 
the increase in license and royalty revenues in was primarily due to patent royalties from increased sales by certain of our licensees  and million of revenue recognized in conjunction with the settlement of the lexar litigation 
revenues from licenses and royalties were of total revenues in and  and in our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
given the current market outlook for  sales of licensed flash products by our licensees may be lower than the corresponding sales in recent quarters  which may cause a drop in our royalty revenues 
gross profits losses 
in fiscal  gross profits declined to negative million  or negative of total revenues from million  or of total revenues in and million  or of total revenues in product gross margins decreased to negative in  from positive in and positive in the decline in gross margins in was primarily due to lower sales volume  severely reduced average selling prices  inventory write downs of approximately million and start up costs associated with our flashvision foundry joint venture of approximately million 
the increases in gross margins in were primarily due to the lower cost per megabyte of our megabit flash memory products  which represented the majority of our product sales in due to weak economic conditions  excess supply in the markets for our products and lower demand from customers as they continued to reduce their inventories  we experienced intense pricing pressures in we expect our average selling prices per megabyte to decline significantly in and possibly beyond  until market supply and demand for our products returns to equilibrium 
although we are taking significant steps to lower our product costs  given the current market conditions  we cannot guarantee that our product cost will decline as quickly as our average selling prices 
if our average selling prices decline faster than our costs  our gross margin will be negatively impacted in research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and development engineers  prototype supplies and contract services 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in in and  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel and higher project related expenses 
the additional project expenses in were to support the development of new generations of nand flash data storage products 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in future quarters to support the development and introduction of new generations of flash data storage products  including our joint venture with toshiba  our co development agreement with sony and our development of advanced controller chips 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  sales commissions  benefits and travel expenses for our sales  marketing  customer service and applications engineering personnel 
these expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such as independent manufacturer s representative commissions  advertising and tradeshow expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreased commission expenses due to lower product revenues  reduction in travel expenses and a decrease in marketing expenses 
the increase in was primarily due to increased salaries and payroll related expense and increased commission expenses due to higher product revenues and increased marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses represented of total revenues in compared to in and in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as sales of our products grow and as we continue to develop the retail channel and brand awareness for our products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance  information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreased legal fees and lower salaries and expenses associated with reduced headcount 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in compared to in and in general and administrative expenses could increase in the future if we pursue litigation to defend our patent portfolio and grow our infrastructure to support our growth 
see factors that may affect future results risks associated with patents  proprietary rights and related litigation 
restructuring charges 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a plan to transfer all of our card assembly and test manufacturing operations from our sunnyvale location to offshore subcontractors 
as a result we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the charge included million of severance and employee related costs for a reduction in workforce of approximately personnel  equipment write off charges of million and lease commitments of million on a vacated warehouse facility 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
as a part of our plan to transfer all card assembly and test manufacturing operations to offshore subcontractors  we abandoned excess equipment and recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal we are attempting to sublease one warehouse building in san jose  california 
given the current real estate market conditions in the san jose area  we do not expect to be able to sublease this building before the end of and as a result  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of of the million restructuring charge  cash payments of million were paid in after writing off certain non cash charges  accruals of million remain as of december   primarily related to severance and benefits to be paid out during fiscal and excess facility charges  which will be paid over the respective lease terms 
we believe that the savings resulting from the restructuring activity will contribute to a reduction in manufacturing and operating expense levels of approximately million in fiscal equity in income of joint venture 
in  equity in income of joint ventures of million included our share of net income from our flashvision joint venture and losses from our dpi joint venture 
interest income expense 
interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investment balances resulting from cash used by operations and strategic investments in tower semiconductor and flashvision 
in addition  overall market interest rates were lower in due to reductions in the federal funds rate 
we expect interest income to decline and interest expense to increase in relative to due to interest expense payable on the convertible notes issued in late and early and the continuing impact of the reduction in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of loss on investment in foundries 
the market value of our investments in umc and tower semiconductor have declined significantly due to the downturn in the economy and excess supply in the semiconductor industry 
the value of our investment in umc had declined to million at december  it was determined that the decline in the market value of the investment in umc was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
we recorded a loss of million on our umc investment in  or million net of taxes  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number if the fair value of our umc investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  if our umc shares are sold  there may be a gain or loss  due to fluctuations in the market value of umc s stock 
the value of our tower investment and wafer credits had declined to million at december  it was determined that this decline was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and a loss of million was recognized 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million on our exchange of of our tower wafer credits for  ordinary shares at per share 
these losses totaling million  or million net of tax benefit  were recorded in loss on foundry investment in if the fair value of our tower investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net was a loss of million in compared to income of  in and income of million in the loss in was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses on our yen denominated assets 
other income in and came primarily from foreign currency transaction gains 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was approximately  while our and effective tax rates were approximately and  respectively 
our tax benefit was generated primarily from our ability to benefit from the net operating loss using carryback capacity along with the unrealized gain on our investment in umc shares 
the tax benefit is limited to the amount of tax refund that we will receive from our loss carryback and the amount available to offset unrealized tax gains related to the umc investment 
as of december   we had recorded the maximum carryback benefit available and therefore future losses may not give rise to a current tax benefit 
our assessment of the amount of valuation allowance required will be influenced by the amount of unrealized tax gains on investments 
any increase in the mark to market value of the investments may result in the recognition of some portion of the valuation allowance 
this may cause the interim tax rate to fluctuate significantly 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million  which included million in unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash equivalents and million in unrestricted short term investments  excluding our investment in umc 
under the terms of the flashvision lease agreement  we as guarantor are required to pledge cash and equity securities up to the full value of the outstanding lease commitments guaranteed by us 
as of december   we had guaranteed million of flashvision s lease commitments and pledged million of cash and cash equivalents and million of our umc equity securities 
this pledged cash and cash equivalents and marketable equity securities are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investment in umc on our balance sheet 
operating activities used million of cash in primarily due to our net loss  an increase in deferred tax assets of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
these were partially offset by cash provided by a decline in accounts receivable of million a reduction in inventories of million and an increase in other current liabilities  related party of million 
cash provided by operations was million and million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in proceeds from net sales of investments of million were partially offset by million invested in flashvision  our foundry joint venture with toshiba  million invested in tower  million invested in dpi  our joint venture with photo me international and million of capital equipment purchases 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which included the million net proceeds from the issuance of long term convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of  and million from the sale of common stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
in  financing activities provided million and million in on december   we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes due  or notes  and on january   the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option to purchase an additional million of notes  for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million  the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each on may and november the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain events 
at anytime on or after november   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a specified percentage of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
in january  the usic foundry was merged into the umc parent company 
in exchange for our usic shares  we received million umc shares 
these shares were valued at approximately million at the time of the merger  resulting in a pretax gain of million million after tax in the first quarter of all of the umc shares we received as a result of the merger were subject to trading restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange 
as of december   the trading restrictions had expired on million shares 
the remaining million shares will become available for sale over a two year period beginning in january we also received million and million shares as stock dividends from umc in and due to the decline in umc stock price from the weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of the company s investment in umc had declined to at december  in  it was determined that the decline in the market value of the investment was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of million  or million net of taxes was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number the loss was included in loss on investment in foundry 
if the fair value of the umc investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  there may be a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of umc stock or if umc shares are sold 
on june   we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of megabit and gigabit flash memory chips and secure digital card controllers 
as part of this transaction  sandisk and toshiba formed flashvision  a joint venture to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at dominion semiconductor in virginia 
in january  we invested the final million of our million cash commitment in flashvision 
we are obligated to guarantee one half of all flashvision lease amounts up to a maximum guarantee of million 
as of december   we had guarantee obligations in the amount of million  with abn amro bank  nv as agent for a syndicate of financial institutions  on the equipment lease lines to equip flashvision s manufacturing clean room with advanced wafer processing equipment 
although flashvision recently terminated the abn amro lease facility  as further discussed below  under the terms of the flashvision lease agreements  we as guarantor remain at this time subject to certain financial covenants 
we obtained a compliance waiver for the third quarter of and negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement which includes a modification of the covenant requirements and requires us to pledge cash and equity securities up to the full value of the outstanding guaranteed lease commitments 
as of december   we had pledged cash of million and umc equity securities of million 
while these assets are pledged  they are not available to us to be used to fund operations 
in december  we signed a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  with toshiba under which we and toshiba agreed to restructure our flashvision business by consolidating our flashvision advanced nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at toshiba s memory fabrication facility at yokkaichi  japan 
the yokkaichi fabrication facility  or yokkaichi  is toshiba s most advanced memory fabrication facility and has approximately twice the wafer fabrication capacity of dominion 
through this consolidation  we expect yokkaichi to provide more cost competitive nand flash wafers than is possible at dominion 
under the terms of the mou  toshiba will transfer the flashvision owned and leased nand production tool set from dominion to yokkaichi and has agreed to bear substantially all of the costs associated with the equipment transfers  which are expected to be completed in once the consolidation is completed  yokkaichi s total nand wafer output will match the combined prior nand capacity of yokkaichi and dominion 
we and toshiba contemplate that the flashvision operation at yokkaichi will continue essentially the same joint venture and on essentially the same terms as we have had at dominion in virginia 
under our joint venture agreement  we are contractually obligated  and expect to continue to be obligated after the restructuring of our flashvision joint venture  to purchase half of flashvision s nand wafer production output 
in march  flashvision notified abn amro that it was exercising its right of early termination under the lease facility and will repay all amounts outstanding thereunder in april we and toshiba are currently seeking other sources of financing to replace the abn amro lease facility 
the transfer and qualification of the advanced fabrication equipment from dominion  virginia to yokkaichi  japan is a highly complex operation 
it is quite possible that we may encounter difficulties and delays 
although the additional costs associated with these potential delays will generally be borne by toshiba  our results of operations may suffer if this equipment transfer is not completed on time and production does not commence at yokkaichi as planned  thereby reducing the total nand production capacity available to us 
on july   we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a million investment in tower  in israel  representing approximately ownership of tower 
the investment is subject to the completion of certain milestones 
during  tower satisfied the closing conditions of the share purchase agreement and completed the first two milestones 
under the terms of the agreement  we invested million to purchase  ordinary shares and obtain wafer credits of million 
in september  we agreed to convert of our wafer credits to equity at a price of per share and received an additional  ordinary shares 
due to the continued weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our tower investment and remaining wafer credits had declined to million at december  it was determined that this decline was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of million was recorded in the second half of in addition we recognized a loss of million on the exchange of of our tower wafer credits for  ordinary shares at per share 
these losses totaling million  or million net of tax benefit were recorded in loss on foundry investment in under our original agreement  additional contributions by us will take the form of mandatory warrant exercises for ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share if other milestones are met by tower 
the warrants will expire five years from the date of grant  and in the event the key milestones are not achieved  the exercise of these warrants will not be mandatory 
however  in march of  we modified our share purchase agreement with tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones to april  and october   respectively 
we will make these payments whether or not tower actually achieves its previously agreed upon milestone obligations 
in exchange for this and as part of the modification to the share purchase agreement  tower has agreed that of the aggregate payment of million represented by the third and fourth milestone payments  i of this amount  or million  will be applied to the issuance of additional ordinary tower shares based on the average closing price of tower shares on the nasdaq in the thirty consecutive trading days preceding each payment date but not to exceed per share and ii of this amount  or million  will be credited to our pre paid wafer account  to be applied against orders placed with tower s new fabrication facility  when completed 
currently  we expect tower to supply us a portion of the asic controller chips used in our flash cards 
we expect first wafer production to commence at the new fabrication facility in late tower s completion of the wafer foundry facility is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israel government s investment center 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry construction in a timely manner or successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies and ramp up of production  the value of our investment in tower will decline significantly or possibly become worthless and we may be unable to obtain the wafers needed to manufacture our products  which would harm our results of operations 
in addition  the value of our investment in tower may be adversely affected by a further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of the tower investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
on august   we entered into a joint venture  dpi  with pmi for the manufacture  installation  marketing  and maintenance of self service  digital photo printing labs  or kiosks  bearing the sandisk brand name in locations in the us and canada 
under the agreement  we and pmi will each make an initial investment of million and secure lease financing for the purchase of the kiosks 
during  we invested million in dpi 
recently  dpi has changed its business plan from leasing the kiosks to customers and sharing in the photo printing revenues generated  to a mix of leasing and selling the kiosks outright 
while this plan may reduce the long term cumulative income from each kiosk  it is expected to reduce substantially dpi s requirements for lease financing 
therefore  we expect based on the current business plan that the total value of our lease guarantees to be below million in pmi will manufacture the kiosks for the joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks under contract with the joint venture 
the first kiosks are currently deployed in pilot programs in select retail stores in the united states  and we expect to gather actual consumer usage information to guide our future continued involvement in the dpi joint venture 
dpi has experienced delays in its us market rollout of the kiosks  due primarily to modifications to improve the kiosk s operation as a standalone  reliable  user friendly photo printing device 
these delays have provided opportunities for several competitors to enter the digital photo printing market with alternative products  which may offer more attractive features or lower costs than the dpi kiosks 
we cannot assure you that these kiosks  if and when they are introduced  will function reliably as intended  or that they will receive favorable acceptance from consumers 
if dpi is unsuccessful  our investment may become worthless  requiring us to record a loss equal to the total amount invested 
we account for this investment under the equity method  and recorded a loss of million as our share of the equity in loss of joint venture in on november   we made a strategic investment of million in divio  inc  or divio 
divio is a privately held manufacturer of digital imaging compression technology and products for future digital camcorders that will be capable of using our flash memory cards to store home video movies  replacing the magnetic tape currently used in these systems 
under the agreement  we own approximately of divio and are entitled to one board seat 
a number of companies are developing compression chip products that may be superior to  or may be offered at a lower cost than the divio chips 
these competing products may render divio s products uncompetitive and thereby significantly reduce the value of our investment in divio 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
less than after total year years years years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes payable see note   operating leases     purchase commitments for flash memory wafers   total contractual cash obligations     on january   we sold an additional million of the notes pursuant to the exercise by the initial purchasers of their option 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in assembly and test manufacturing equipment or foundry capacity to support our business in the future 
we may also invest in or acquire other companies product lines or assets 
our operating expenses may increase as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities  including our collaboration with toshiba for the joint development of megabit and gigabit flash memory chips and sony for the joint development of the next generation memory stick 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
impact of currency exchange rates a portion of our revenues is denominated in japanese yen 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   one forward contract with a notional amount of million was outstanding 
no forward contacts were outstanding at december  future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors  including the following 
unpredictable or declining demand for our products  
decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressures  
seasonality in sales of our products  
natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly o japan  where our sole source of nand flash memory wafer capacity will be located and  to a lesser extent  taiwan  china and the united states  
excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own flash wafer capacity  which may cause an acceleration in the decline in our average selling prices  
difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels  in particular  building a large o inventory of unsold product due to non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase materials such as flash wafers  controllers  printed circuit boards and discrete components  
expenses related to obsolescence or devaluation of unsold inventory  
adverse changes in product and customer mix  
slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  
competing flash memory card standards  which displace the standards used in our products  
changes in our distribution channels  
fluctuations in our license and royalty revenue  
fluctuations in product costs  particularly due to fluctuations in manufacturing yields and utilization  
availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet customer demand  
shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products  
significant yield losses  which could affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and could increase our costs  
manufacturing flaws affecting the reliability  functionality or performance of our products  o which could increase our product costs  reduce demand for our products or require product recalls  
increased research and development expenses  
exchange rate fluctuations  particularly the us dollar to japanese yen exchange rate  
changes in general economic conditions  particularly in japan and the european union  and 
reduced sales to our retail customers if consumer confidence declines or economic conditions worsen 
difficulty of estimating silicon wafer needs 
when we order silicon wafers from our foundries  we have to estimate the number of silicon wafers needed to fill product orders several months into the future 
if we overestimate this number  we will build excess inventories  which could harm our gross margins and operating results 
on the other hand  if we underestimate the number of silicon wafers needed to fill product orders  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  which could harm our product revenues 
because the majority of our compactflash  smartmedia card  multimediacard and secure digital card  are sold into emerging consumer markets  it has been difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
in addition  bookings visibility remains low due to the current economic uncertainty in our markets 
a substantial majority of our quarterly sales are currently  and have historically been  from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  which makes accurate forecasting very difficult 
our product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
variability of expense levels 
despite the significant actions we took in to align expense levels with decreased revenues  we may need to hire additional personnel in certain business areas or otherwise increase our operating expenses in the future to support our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities 
we have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce these expenses over the short term 
if our revenues do not increase proportionately to our operating expenses  or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a particular period  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
variability of average selling prices and gross margins 
our product mix varies quarterly  which affects our overall average selling prices and gross margins 
our compactflash  smartmedia card  multimediacard and secure digital card products  which currently represent the majority of our product revenues  have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity flashdisk and flashdrive products 
we believe that sales of compactflash  smartmedia card  multimediacard and secure digital card products will continue to represent a significant percentage of our product revenues as consumer applications  such as digital cameras and digital music players  become more popular 
flash data storage markets are intensely competitive  and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points 
due to continued oversupply in flash memory foundry capacity throughout and the economic slow down in  the decline in our average selling price per megabyte of was much more severe than the decrease we experienced in and we expect that price declines for our products in the next several quarters could be significant 
if we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in future periods to offset further price reductions  our gross margins and net profitability will suffer 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced retail sales of memory stick cards supplied to us under an oem supply and purchase agreement with sony 
we cannot assure you that the gross margins on the sale of memory stick products will be comparable to the gross margins from the sale of our other products 
variability of license fees and royalties 
our intellectual property strategy consists of cross licensing our patents to other manufacturers of flash products 
under these arrangements  we earn license fees and royalties on individually negotiated terms 
the timing of revenue recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by the third parties 
our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
given the current market outlook for the first quarter of and beyond  sales of licensed flash products by our licensees may be substantially lower than the corresponding sales in recent quarters  which may cause a substantial drop in our royalty revenues 
because these revenues have higher gross margins than our product revenues  our overall gross margins and net income fluctuate significantly with changes in license and royalty revenues 
we cannot assure you that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration  or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future 
our selling prices may be affected by excess capacity in the market for flash memory products throughout  worldwide flash memory supply exceeded customer demand  causing excess supply in the markets for our products and significant declines in average selling prices 
if this situation continues in  price declines for our products could continue to be significant 
if we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs to offset these reduced prices  our gross margins and net profitability will be adversely impacted 
our business depends significantly upon consumer products in  we continued to receive more product revenue and ship more units of products for consumer electronics applications  including digital cameras and pdas  compared to other applications 
in the fourth quarter of  we shipped a record number of units to the consumer market 
the consumer market is intensely competitive and is more price sensitive than our other target markets 
in addition  we must spend more on marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name recognition and drive demand 
a significant portion of our sales to the consumer electronics market are made to retailers and through distributors 
sales through these channels typically include rights to return unsold inventory 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold through to the end user 
if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  there could be substantial product returns  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is seasonality in our business sales of our products in the consumer electronics market may be subject to seasonality 
as a result  product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year followed by declines in the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from our japanese oem customers primarily because most customers in japan operate on a fiscal year ending in march and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of their next fiscal year 
in transitioning to new processes and products  we face production and market acceptance risks general 
successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity per chip 
two important factors have enabled us to decrease the cost per megabyte of our flash data storage products the development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of smaller geometry manufacturing processes 
a number of challenges exist in achieving a lower cost per megabyte  including 
lower yields often experienced in the early production of new semiconductor devices  
manufacturing flaws with new processes including manufacturing processes at our subcontractors which may be extremely complex  
problems with design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate these devices  which may result in delays or product recalls  and 
production delays 
because our products are complex  we periodically experience significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products 
similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nand mlc flash technology 
we have developed new products based on nand mlc multi level cell flash technology  a flash architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell 
high density flash memory  such as nand mlc flash  is a complex technology that requires strict manufacturing controls and effective test screens 
problems encountered in the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability and yields  and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product availability 
nand mlc technology is highly complex and has not previously been successfully commercialized 
we may not be able to manufacture future generations of nand mlc products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte 
if we are unable to bring future generations of high density flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience unplanned yield or reliability problems  our revenues and gross margins will decline 
secure digital card products 
sandisk  along with matsushita and toshiba  jointly developed and jointly promote the secure digital card 
the secure digital card incorporates advanced security and copyright protection features required by the emerging markets for the electronic distribution of music  video and other copyrighted works 
although the secure digital card is designed specifically to address the copy protection rights of the content providers  there can be no assurance that these content providers will find these measures sufficient or will agree to support them 
furthermore  despite numerous design wins  the secure digital card standard has been slow to develop as a major new standard and we cannot assure you that consumers will widely adopt the secure digital card 
conversely  broad acceptance of our secure digital card by consumers will likely reduce demand for our multimediacard and compactflash card products 
during  we experienced a substantial decline in sales of multimediacards which was not matched by a corresponding increase in sales of secure digital cards 
see the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products 
memory stick products 
in september  we signed an agreement with sony involving their memory stick card format 
under the agreement  sony will supply us a portion of their memory stick output for us to resell under our brand name 
sony has also agreed to purchase a portion of their nand memory chip requirements from us provided that we meet market competitive pricing for these components 
in addition  we and sony agreed to co develop and co own the specifications for the next generation memory stick 
each of us will have all rights to manufacture and sell this new generation memory stick 
we cannot assure you that this new business will generate substantial revenues or gross margin contributions for us 
consumers may prefer to purchase the sony brand memory stick over our sandisk brand memory stick 
furthermore  the second generation memory stick is still in the early stages of development and is not expected to generate significant sales before we cannot assure you that the second generation memory stick will achieve commercial success in the marketplace when it is introduced 
we are transitioning our technology to nand based products 
the transition to nand based products is very complex  and requires good execution from our manufacturing  technology  quality  marketing  and sales and customer support staffs 
if the current soft market conditions continue throughout and beyond  or if we are unable for any reason to achieve customer acceptance of our card products built with these nand flash chips  we will experience a significant increase in our inventory  as we are contractually obligated  and expect to continue to be obligated after the restructuring of our flashvision business  to purchase half of flashvision s nand wafer production output 
this may result in inventory write offs and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the third quarter of  we began to purchase controller wafers from umc and are continuing development of advanced flash memory technology utilizing the micron technology design rules at umc 
we depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers all of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers  the majority of which are currently supplied by toshiba s wafer facility at yokkaichi  japan  as well as umc in taiwan 
after the restructuring of our flashvision business  all of our nand flash memory wafers will be supplied by toshiba s yokkaichi wafer facilities 
if toshiba  flashvision and umc are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy these requirements  our business  financial condition and operating results may suffer 
any disruption in supply from these sources due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  flashvision and umc  we are obligated to provide a rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders for the next six calendar months 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining months may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
for example  if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders  we may end up with excess wafer inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders  which could result in dissatisfied customers  lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers with acceptable price and yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
our investment in new flash memory wafer production may result in increased expenses and fluctuations in operating results flashvision  llc on june   we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of megabit and gigabit flash memory chips and secure digital card controllers 
as a part of this transaction  we and toshiba formed and contributed initial funding to flashvision  a joint venture to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at dominion semiconductor in virginia 
in january  we invested the final million of our million cash commitment 
as of december  we had guaranteed million in equipment lease lines to equip toshiba s dominion semiconductor manufacturing clean room with advanced wafer processing equipment 
we are obligated to guarantee a total of up to million in equipment lease lines 
in december  we and toshiba agreed to restructure our flashvision business and to transfer its operations to toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility in japan 
under the terms of the mou  toshiba will transfer the flashvision owned and leased nand production tool set from dominion to yokkaichi and has agreed to bear substantially all of the costs associated with the equipment transfers  which are expected to be completed in the transfer and qualification of the advanced fabrication equipment from dominion  virginia to yokkaichi  japan is a highly complex operation 
it is quite possible that we may encounter difficulties and delays 
although the additional costs associated with potential delays will be borne by toshiba  our results of operations may suffer if this equipment transfer is not completed on time and production does not commence at yokkaichi as planned  thereby reducing the total nand production capacity available to us 
we were using the new production capacity at dominion to manufacture nand flash memory wafers with minimum lithographic feature size of micron 
late in  we expect to start shifting a portion of our production output at yokkaichi to micron nand 
such minimum feature sizes are considered today to be among the most advanced for mass production of silicon wafers 
therefore  it is difficult to predict how long it will take to achieve adequate yields  reliable operation  and economically attractive product costs based on our new designs 
introduction of new feature sizes and technologies will be subject to the same risks and uncertainties after the restructuring of our flashvision business 
we currently rely and will continue to rely on toshiba to address these challenges 
with our investments in the dominion facility and in toshiba s yokkaichi facility after the restructuring of our flashvision business  we are now and will continue to be exposed to the adverse financial impact of any delays or manufacturing problems associated with wafer production lines 
any problems or delays in volume production at the yokkaichi fabrication facility could adversely impact our operating results in and beyond 
we incurred substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel  facilitizing the clean room and installing equipment at the dominion fabrication facility 
although as a part of our agreement with toshiba to restructure our flashvision business we will recapture substantially all of the dominion start up expenses 
we will incur similar start up expenses in connection with the new yokkaichi fabrication facility 
in addition  we may not achieve the expected cost benefits of this transition until the second half of  if at all 
until the transition of the dominion tool set is completed  we will rely solely on the current yokkaichi fabrication facility for our nand wafers 
if we experience increased demand during this transition period  we may not be able to procure a sufficient number of wafers from toshiba to meet this demand  which would harm our business and operating results 
under our agreement with toshiba  we are committed to purchase of the output from the dominion fabrication facility prior to the flashvision restructuring and from the yokkaichi fabrication facility after the restructuring 
apart from our commitment to purchase our share of the flashvision wafer output from yokkaichi after the restructuring  we will also purchase nand wafers from toshiba s current yokkaichi fabrication facility on a foundry relationship basis 
this foundry relationship will be conducted under a firm purchase order commitment over rolling three month periods 
nand wafers are ordered under purchase orders at market prices and cannot be cancelled 
if we place purchase orders with toshiba and our business condition deteriorates  we may end up with excess inventories of nand wafers  which could harm our business and financial condition 
we will incur start up costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the new yokkaichi output 
should customer demand for nand flash products be less than our available supply  we may suffer from reduced revenues and increased expenses  and increased inventory of unsold nand flash wafers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in order for us to sell nand based compactflash  multimediacards and secure digital cards  we have been developing new controllers  printed circuit boards and test algorithms because the architecture of nand flash is significantly different from our prior nor flash designs 
any technical difficulties or delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available nand output and could adversely affect our results of operations 
tower semiconductor 
on july   we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a million investment in tower semiconductor  or tower  in israel  representing approximately ownership of tower 
the investment is subject to the completion of certain milestones relative to the construction of a new wafer fabrication facility by tower 
during  tower satisfied the closing conditions of the share purchase agreement and completed the first two milestones 
under the terms of the agreement  we invested million to purchase  ordinary shares and obtain wafer credits of million 
in september  we agreed to convert of our wafer credits to equity at a price of per share and received an additional  ordinary shares 
we expect first wafer production to commence at the new fabrication facility in late due to the continued weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our tower investment and remaining wafer credits had declined to million on december  it was determined that this decline was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of million was recorded in the second half of in addition  we recognized a loss of million on our exchange of of our tower wafer credits for ordinary shares 
these losses totaling million  or million net of tax benefit  were recorded in loss on investment in foundry in in march of  we modified our share purchase agreement with tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones to april  and october   respectively 
we will make these payments whether or not tower actually achieves its previously agreed upon milestone obligations 
in exchange for this and as part of the modification to the share purchase agreement  tower has agreed that of the aggregate payment of million represented by the third and fourth milestone payments  i of this amount  or million  will be applied to the issuance of additional ordinary tower shares based on the average closing price of tower shares on the nasdaq in the thirty consecutive trading days preceding each payment date but not to exceed per share and ii of this amount  or million  will be credited to our pre paid wafer account  to be applied against orders placed with tower s new fabrication facility  when completed 
tower s completion of the wafer foundry facility is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israel government s investment center 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry construction in a timely manner or is unable to successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies and ramp up of production  the value of our investment in tower will decline significantly or possibly become worthless and we may be unable to obtain the wafers needed to manufacture our products  which would harm our results of operations 
in addition  the value of our investment in tower may be adversely affected by a further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of the tower investment declines further  we may record additional losses 
the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products in order for demand for our products to grow  the markets for new products that use compactflash  the multimediacard  and secure digital card such as digital cameras  portable digital music players and cellular phones must develop and grow 
if sales of these products do not grow  our revenues and profit margins could be adversely impacted 
in  we experienced a substantial drop in demand from our multimediacard customers  which we believe is attributable to the switch by these customers to the secure digital card  as well as the generally soft market conditions 
the success of our new product strategy will depend upon  among other things  the following 
our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte  
the development of new applications or markets for our flash data storage products  
the adoption by the major content providers of the copy protection features offered by our secure digital card products  
the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their products and successfully introduce their products  and 
the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others 
megabit and gigabit flash memory card products 
on june   we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development of megabit and gigabit flash memory chips and the manufacture of secure digital card controllers 
as part of this venture  we and toshiba plan to employ toshiba s micron and future micron nand flash integrated circuit manufacturing technology and sandisk s multilevel cell flash and controller system technology 
during the third quarter of  we announced with toshiba the completion of the joint development of the megabit nand flash chip employing toshiba s micron manufacturing process technology 
we began employing the megabit technology in the second half of  and expect to commence shipments of cards employing the gigabit technology in the first half of the development of the next generation 
micron  gigabit and gigabit nand flash memory chips is highly complex 
we cannot assure you that we and toshiba will successfully develop and bring into full production with acceptable yields and reliability these new products or the underlying technology  or that any development or production ramp will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner 
if we are not successful in any of the above  or if our cost structure is not competitive  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we may be unable to maintain market share during periods of excess supply in the market for our flash memory products  such as we experienced in and continue to experience  we may lose market share to competitors who aggressively lower their prices 
conversely  under conditions of tight flash memory supply  we may be unable to increase our production volumes at a sufficiently rapid rate so as to maintain our market share 
ultimately  our growth rate depends on our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to meet demand 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner  we may lose market share to our competitors 
currently  we are experiencing severe price competition for our products which is adversely impacting our product gross margins and overall profitability 
our international operations make us vulnerable to changing conditions and currency fluctuations political risks 
currently  the majority of our flash memory and controller wafers are produced by toshiba in japan and umc in taiwan 
after the restructuring of our flashvision business  all of our flash memory and controller wafers will be produced overseas by toshiba and umc 
we also use third party subcontractors in taiwan and china for the assembly and testing of some of our card and component products 
we may therefore be affected by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan 
taiwan is currently engaged in various political disputes with china and in the past both countries have conducted military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
the taiwanese and chinese governments may escalate these disputes  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping routes or even military hostilities 
this could harm our business by interrupting or delaying the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or card products by our taiwanese foundry and subcontractors 
see we depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors 
we use a third party subcontractor in china for the assembly and testing of our compactflash products 
as a result  our business could be harmed by the effect of political  economic  legal and other uncertainties in china 
under its current leadership  the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies and  even if it does continue  these policies may not be successful 
the chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to time 
in addition  china does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system  particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights 
as a result  enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent 
such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection 
although we do not believe the current political unrest and escalation of violence in israel represent a major security problem for tower since migdal haemek  israel is in a relatively secure geographic location  the unrest may expand and even if it remains at current levels  could cause scheduling delays  as well as economic uncertainty  which could cause potential foundry customers to go elsewhere for their foundry business 
moreover  if us military actions in afghanistan  or elsewhere  result in retaliation against israel  tower s fabrication facility and our engineering design center in israel may be adversely impacted 
we cannot assure you that the tower facility will be completed or will begin production as scheduled  or that the processes needed to fabricate our wafers will be qualified at the new facility 
moreover  we cannot assure you that this new facility will be able to achieve acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price 
furthermore  if the current depressed business conditions for semiconductor wafers persists in and beyond  tower may be unable to operate their new fabrication facility at an optimum capacity utilization  which would cause them to operate at a loss 
in addition  while the political unrest has not yet posed a direct security risk to our engineering design center in israel  it may cause unforeseen delays in the development of our products and may in the future pose such a direct security risk 
economic risks 
we price our products primarily in us dollars 
given the recent economic conditions in asia and the european union and the weakness of the euro  yen and other currencies relative to the us dollar  our products may be relatively more expensive in these regions  which could result in a decrease in our sales 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
general risks 
our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors 
the need to comply with foreign government regulation  
general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  
natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  such as the earthquakes experienced in taiwan in and in japan and china in previous years  
imposition of regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  
longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  particularly as we increase our sales through the retail distribution channel  and general business conditions deteriorate  
adverse tax rules and regulations  
weak protection of our intellectual property rights  and 
delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions 
we depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors we rely on our vendors  some of which are sole source suppliers  for several of our critical components 
we do not have long term supply agreements with some of these vendors 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components 
for example  after the restructuring of our flashvision business  we will rely on toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility for all of our flash memory wafers 
any disruption in the supply of wafers from the yokkaichi fabrication facility would severely adversely impact our business 
until the transition of the dominion tool set is completed  we will rely solely on the current yokkaichi fabrication facility for our nand wafers 
if we experience increased demand during this transition period  we may not be able to procure a sufficient number of wafers from toshiba to meet this demand  which would harm our business and operating results 
we also rely on third party subcontractors for a substantial portion of wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  card assembly and card testing  including silicon precision industries co  ltd 
in taiwan and celestica  inc in china 
these subcontractors will also be assembling and testing a majority of our mature  high volume products 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the transfer of all of our card assembly and test manufacturing operations from our sunnyvale location to these offshore subcontractors 
we have no long term contracts with these subcontractors and cannot directly control product delivery schedules 
any significant problems that occur at our subcontractors  or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems  which could increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our operating results 
furthermore  we are moving to turnkey manufacturing with some of our subcontract suppliers  which may reduce our visibility and control of their inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products 
our markets are highly competitive flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers 
we compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers 
our primary competitors include companies that develop and manufacture storage flash chips  such as hitachi  samsung  micron technology and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory and companies that purchase flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
companies that manufacture socket flash  linear flash and components include advanced micro devices  atmel  fujitsu  intel  macronix  mitsubishi  sharp electronics and st microelectronics 
companies that combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards include dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  inc  feiya technology corporation  fuji  hagiwara  i o data  ingentix  kingston technology  lexar media  m systems  matsushita battery  matsushita panasonic  memorex  pny  pretec  silicon storage technology  silicon tek  simple technology  sony corporation  tdk corporation  toshiba and viking components 
in addition  many companies have been certified by the compactflash association to manufacture and sell their own brand of compactflash 
we believe additional manufacturers will enter the compactflash market in the future 
we have entered into an agreement with matsushita and toshiba  forming the secure digital association  or sd association  to jointly develop and promote a next generation flash memory card called the secure digital card 
under this agreement  royalty bearing secure digital card licenses will be available to other flash memory card manufacturers  which will increase the competition for our secure digital card and other products 
in addition  matsushita and toshiba have commenced selling secure digital cards that will compete directly with our products 
while other flash card manufacturers will be required to pay the sd association license fees and royalties  which will be shared among matsushita  toshiba and us  there will be no royalties or license fees payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the secure digital card 
thus  we will forfeit potential royalty income from secure digital card sales by matsushita and toshiba 
in addition  we and toshiba will each separately market and sell any megabit and gigabit flash memory chips developed and manufactured by our joint venture  flashvision 
accordingly  we will compete directly with toshiba for sales of these advanced chips 
we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors including hitachi  intel  lexar  matsushita  sst  samsung  sharp  sony  toshiba and tdk 
under these agreements  each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other party s patent or patents related to flash memory devices 
as we continue to license our patents to certain of our competitors  competition will increase and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are engaged in licensing discussions with several of our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms which are favorable to us  or at all 
alternative storage media 
competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that are different from our products including sony s standard floppy disk used for digital storage in its mavica digital cameras  panasonic s mega storage cards  iomega s clik drive  a miniaturized  mechanical  removable disk drive  m systems diskonkey  a usb based memory device  and the secure multimediacard from hitachi and infineon 
each competing standard may not be mechanically and electronically compatible with our products 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards  our products will be eliminated from use in that product 
in addition  other companies  such as sanyo  dataplay and matrix semiconductor have announced products or technologies that may potentially compete with our products 
ibm s microdrive  a rotating disk drive in a type ii compactflash format competes directly with our larger capacity memory cards 
m systems diskonchip millennium product competes against our nand flash components in embedded storage applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances 
sony has licensed its proprietary memory stick to us and other companies and sony has agreed to supply us a portion of their memory stick output for resale under our brand name 
if consumer electronics products using the memory stick achieve widespread use  sales of our multimediacard  secure digital card  smartmedia card and compactflash products may decline 
our multimediacard products also have faced significant competition from toshiba s smartmedia flash cards 
alternative flash technologies 
we also face competition from products based on multilevel cell flash technology from intel and hitachi 
these products currently compete with our nand mlc products 
multilevel cell flash is a technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of information instead of the traditional single bit stored by conventional flash technology 
furthermore  we expect to face competition both from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have similar or alternative data storage solutions  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
for example  infineon has formed a joint venture with saifun  an israeli startup company  to develop a proprietary flash memory technology which will be targeted at low cost data storage applications 
price is an important competitive factor in the market for consumer products 
increased price competition could lower gross margins if our average selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could also result in lost sales 
sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues 
approximately one half of our revenues come from a small number of customers 
for example  sales to our top customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our product revenues for   and in and  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
in  revenues from one customer exceeded of our total revenues 
if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
our sales are generally made by standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
in addition  the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers products changes 
our multiple sales channels may compete for a limited number of customer sales web based sales of our products today represent a small but growing portion of our overall sales 
sales on the internet tend to undercut traditional distribution channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products are purchased in future years 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop the internet sales channel or successfully manage the inherent conflict between the internet and our traditional sales channels 
we must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures 
yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
the risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely exclusively on independent offshore foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if the foundries cannot achieve planned yields  we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the yokkaichi fabrication facilities will produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with acceptable prices  reliability and yields 
any failure in this regard could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the transition from the dominion fabrication facility to the new yokkaichi fabrication facility  when we will be solely reliant on the current yokkaichi fabrication facility for our nand wafers  any such failure will be particularly harmful to us as we will not have an alternate source of supply 
in addition  we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we intend to rely on the existing manufacturing organizations at the yokkaichi fabrication facilities 
the new yokkaichi fabrication facility will be tasked to copy exactly the same manufacturing flow employed by toshiba in its existing yokkaichi fabrication facility but we cannot assure you that they will be successful in manufacturing these advanced nand flash products on a cost effective basis or at all 
risks associated with patents  proprietary rights and related litigation general 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and claims that we may be infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
we expect that we may be involved in similar disputes in the future 
we cannot assure you that 
any of our existing patents will not be invalidated  
patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  
any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  
our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage  or 
any of our products do not infringe on the patents of other companies 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents 
we intend to vigorously enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our efforts will be successful 
if we were to have an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
any litigation is likely to result in significant expense to us  as well as divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
cross licenses and indemnification obligations 
if we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or if we are found to infringe on others intellectual property  we could be required to license intellectual property from a third party 
we may also need to license some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain cross licenses to third party patents 
currently  we have patent cross license agreements with several companies  including hitachi  intel  lexar  matsushita  sst  samsung  sharp  smartdisk  sony  tdk and toshiba and we are in discussions with other companies regarding potential cross license agreements 
we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered when we need them  or that the terms offered will be acceptable 
if we do obtain licenses from third parties  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments 
in addition  if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to the manufacture of our products  we could be required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our wafer suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses will be available under reasonable terms  or that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration  or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future 
we have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies  but may  in some instances  include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorney s fees 
we may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
we are not currently engaged in any such indemnification proceedings 
our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement 
any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
litigation risks associated with our intellectual property 
litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause litigation results to differ include  but are not limited to  the discovery of previously unknown facts  changes in the law or in the interpretation of laws  and uncertainties associated with the judicial decision making process 
furthermore  parties that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may countersue us for infringing their patents 
on or about august   the lemelson medical  education research foundation  or lemelson foundation  filed a complaint for patent infringement against us and four other defendants 
the suit  captioned lemelson medical  education  research foundation  limited partnership vs 
broadcom corporation  et al  civil case no 
civ phx hrh  was filed in the united states district court  district of arizona 
on november   the lemelson foundation filed an amended complaint  which made the same substantive allegations against us but named more than twenty five additional defendants 
the amended complaint alleges that we  and the other defendants  have infringed certain patents held by the lemelson foundation pertaining to bar code scanning technology 
by its complaint  the lemelson foundation requests that we be enjoined from our allegedly infringing activities and seeks unspecified damages 
on february   we filed an answer to the amended complaint  wherein we alleged that we do not infringe the asserted patents  and further contend that the patents are not valid or enforceable 
on october   we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the united states district court for the northern district of california against micron technology  inc  or micron 
in the suit  captioned sandisk corp 
v 
micron technology  inc  civil no 
cv cw  the complaint seeks damages and an injunction against micron for making  selling  importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our us patent no 
 on february   micron answered the complaint  denied liability  and counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the patent in suit is not infringed  is invalid  and is unenforceable 
on october   we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the united states district court for the northern district of california against memorex products  inc  pretec electronics corporation  ritek corporation and power quotient international co  ltd 
in the suit  captioned sandisk corp 
v 
memorex products  inc  et 
al  civil no 
cv vrw  we seek damages and injunctions against these companies from making  selling  importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our us patent no 
 or the patent 
defendants memorex  pretec and ritek have filed answers denying the allegations 
we filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the suit to enjoin memorex  pretec and ritek from making  selling  importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our patent prior to the trial on the merits 
this preliminary injunction motion is scheduled for hearing on april  on november   we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the united states district court for the northern district of california against power quotient international usa inc  or pqi usa 
in the suit  captioned sandisk corp 
v 
power quotient international usa inc  civil no 
c  we seek damages and an injunction against pqi usa from making  selling  importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our us patent no 
 the pqi usa complaint and litigation are related to the october  litigation referred to above 
the products at issue in the pqi usa case are identical to those charged with infringement in the october  litigation 
on december   pqi usa filed an answer to the complaint denying the allegations  which included a counter claim for a declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity of our patent 
we have motioned for a preliminary injunction in the suit to enjoin pqi usa from making  selling  importing or using flash memory cards that infringe our patent prior to the trial on the merits 
this preliminary injunction motion is scheduled for hearing on april  on or about march   samsung electronics co  ltd  or samsung  filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
the lawsuit alleges that we infringe four samsung united states patents  nos 
   and  and seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction against unnamed products of ours  as well as damages  attorneys fees and cost of the lawsuit 
rapid growth may strain our operations despite actions we took in to align expense levels with decreased revenues  we must continue to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees to accommodate future growth 
in the past  we have experienced difficulty hiring the necessary engineering  sales and marketing personnel to support our growth 
in addition  we must make a significant investment in our existing internal information management systems to support increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price the recent terrorist attacks in the united states  the us retaliation for these attacks and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a substantial adverse impact on our retail sales 
if consumer confidence does not recover  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted in the first quarter of and beyond 
in addition  any similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers 
this could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our success depends on key personnel  including our executive officers  the loss of whom could disrupt our business our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development  sales  marketing and operations personnel  including dr 
eli harari  our founder  president and chief executive officer 
our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such key personnel  or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of sandisk 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile the market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  in the months ending december   our stock price fluctuated significantly from a low of to a high of 
we believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of future announcements concerning us  our competitors or principal customers regarding technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile  often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies 
these fluctuations as well as general economic  political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock 
our digital portal inc  or dpi  joint venture has an unproven product and an untested market dpi has experienced delays in its us market rollout of its photo printing kiosks  due primarily to modifications to improve the kiosk s operation as a standalone  reliable  user friendly photo printing device 
we cannot assure you that these kiosks  if and when they are introduced will function reliably as intended  or that they will receive favorable acceptance from consumers in a reasonable period of time 
if dpi is unsuccessful  our financial results may be harmed 
we have substantially increased our indebtedness 
on december   we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes due  or notes  and on january   we sold an additional million of the notes pursuant to the exercise by the initial purchasers of their option 
as a result  we incurred million aggregate principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
while the notes are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately million per year in interest payments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could 
require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  
make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  
cause us to use a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents or possibly liquidate other assets to repay the total principal amount due under the notes and our other indebtedness if we were to default under the notes or our other indebtedness  
limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business and the industries in which we complete  
place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and 
make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with toshiba  under which we formed flashvision 
we agreed to guarantee one half of all flashvision lease amounts up to a maximum guarantee of million 
as of december   we had guarantee obligations in the amount of million in favor of abn amro bank nv  as agent for a syndicate of financial institutions on the equipment lease lines to equip flashvision 
this guarantee constitutes senior indebtedness under the notes 
in march  flashvision notified abn amro that it was exercising its right of early termination under the lease facility and will repay all amounts outstanding thereunder in april we and toshiba are currently seeking other sources of financing to replace the abn amro lease facility 
however  under the terms of the flashvision lease agreements  we as guarantor remain at this time subject to certain financial covenants 
we obtained a compliance waiver for the third quarter of and negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement which includes a modification of the covenant requirements and required us to pledge cash and equity securities up to the full value of the outstanding guaranteed lease commitments beginning in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had guaranteed million of flashvision s lease commitments and pledged million of cash and cash equivalents and million of our umc equity securities 
if  in connection with the restructuring of our flashvision business and the early termination of the abn amro lease facility  we and toshiba are unable to refinance the existing abn amro lease facility  we may use a portion of the proceeds from the notes to repay these obligations 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in replacing flashvision s lease facility 
we may not be able to satisfy a fundamental change offer under the indenture governing the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a fundamental change 
a fundamental change as defined in the indenture would occur if we were to be acquired for consideration other than cash or securities traded on a major us securities market 
if someone triggers a fundamental change  we may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we have to make a fundamental change offer  we cannot be sure that we will have enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender 
our failure to redeem tendered notes upon a fundamental change would constitute a default under the indenture  which would constitute a default under the abn amro bank nv guarantee and might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness  which would significantly harm our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other indebtedness  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and also could cause defaults under our other indebtedness 
any such default would harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 
we may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
we currently expect that our existing cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the notes will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures at least through however  in the event we need to raise additional funds during that time period or in future periods  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities 
if we issue additional equity securities  our stockholders will experience additional dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock or debt securities 
in addition  if we raise funds through debt financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could harm our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could have a negative impact on our business 
the notes and other indebtedness have rights senior to those of our current stockholders 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness  including the amount we have guaranteed on behalf of flashvision and obligations under the notes  have been paid in full 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to make any distributions to our stockholders 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at december  interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
currency forward contracts are utilized in this hedging program 
our hedging program reduces  but does not always entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes in of approximately market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio and equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains on short term equity securities totaling million which were included in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains include an unrealized gain of million on the appreciation in value of our investment in umc 
the market value of our investment in umc has fluctuated significantly in the past and may decline in the future due to downturns in the semiconductor industry  declines in demand for umc s products or unfavorable economic conditions 
if we sell umc shares in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of our umc stock 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
