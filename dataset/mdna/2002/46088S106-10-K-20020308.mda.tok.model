item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we manage  lease  and operate a portfolio of hospitality properties and provide related services in the hotel  corporate housing  resort  conference center  and golf markets 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
we were created in connection with the august  merger of american general hospitality corporation and capstar hotel company 
at the time of the merger  capstar distributed all of the shares of our common stock to its shareholders and we became a separate  publicly traded company 
the merger created meristar hospitality corporation  a real estate investment trust 
we are the manager and operator of all of the hotels owned by meristar hospitality 
on may   we completed the acquisition of bridgestreet accommodations  inc bridgestreet provides corporate housing services in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and france 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of bridgestreet since may  we operate our corporate housing division under the name bridgestreet corporate housing worldwide or bridgestreet 
until january   we leased from meristar hospitality their hotels that we operated 
as of january   we assigned these participating leases to wholly owned taxable subsidiaries of meristar hospitality 
in connection with the assignment  meristar hospitality s taxable subsidiaries executed new management agreements with us to manage these hotels 
under these management agreements  meristar hospitality s taxable subsidiaries pay us a management fee for each property 
the management agreements were structured to substantially mirror the economics of the former leases 
we and meristar hospitality did not exchange any cash consideration except for the transfer of hotel operating assets and liabilities to the taxable subsidiaries 
under the new management agreements  the base management fee is of total hotel revenue plus incentives payments  based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to of total hotel revenue 
the agreements have an initial term of years with three renewal periods of five years each at our option  subject to some exceptions 
because these leases have been assigned to meristar hospitality s taxable subsidiaries  those taxable subsidiaries now bear the operating risk associated with these hotels 
on january   we invested  in flagstone hospitality management llc  a joint venture established to manage hotels owned by rfs hotel investors  inc we owned of  and controlled  the joint venture during we have included the results of flagstone in our consolidated financial statements since january  effective january   flagstone became a single member llc  of which we own 
on august   our corporate housing division acquired paris based apalachee bay properties 
apalachee bay is an apartment finder service  third party manager and a property sales brokerage business  representing units 
apalachee bay has been renamed bridgestreet paris 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of bridgestreet paris since august  the following table summarizes our historical portfolio of managed and leased hotel properties as of december leased managed total properties rooms properties rooms properties rooms as discussed above  effective january   we converted leases with meristar hospitality to long term management contracts 
in addition  during  we terminated three leases with another hotel owner and converted those leases to long term management contracts 
our remaining leases are with winston hotels  inc we have had  and continue to have  discussions with winston to convert these leases to long term management contracts 
we believe management contracts provide a better alignment of interests between a hotel s owner and operator 
business summary the terrorist attacks of september  have had a negative impact on our hotel operations in the third and fourth quarters  causing lower than expected performance in an already slowing economy 
the events of september th have caused a significant decrease in our hotels occupancy and average daily rate due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety 
major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been adversely affected due to concerns about air travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel 
although the conversion of our leases with meristar hospitality to management contracts on january  has significantly reduced the earnings volatility from hotel operations  we still experience the effects of market downturns because our management fees are tied directly to hotel revenues  and we continue to lease hotel properties not owned by meristar hospitality 
in response to the decline in operating activity following the terrorist attacks  we have worked with our hotel owners to aggressively review and reduce the cost structure of the hotels we operate 
we have implemented numerous cost cutting strategies  including the following items 
reducing overall staffing and reducing hours for remaining hourly staff  
instituting hiring and wage freezes for all properties  
revising operating procedures to gain greater efficiencies and or reduce costs  
closing under utilized or duplicative facilities and outlets  
creating revised minimum staffing guides for each department in our hotels  and 
reducing capital expenditures to focus primarily on life safety requirements  and deferring or terminating discretionary capital outlays 
the september  terrorist attacks were unprecedented in scope and in their immediate dramatic impact on travel patterns 
we have not previously experienced such events  and it is currently not possible to accurately predict if and when travel patterns will be restored to pre september levels 
while we have had improvements in our operating levels from the period immediately following the attacks  we believe the uncertainty associated with subsequent incidents and the possibility of future attacks will continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns for the next several quarters 
our senior secured credit facility requires us to meet or exceed certain financial performance ratios at the end of each quarter 
travel disruptions and safety concerns following the terrorist attacks on september  and the slowdown of the national economy resulted in a significant negative impact to the lodging industry and our operations 
this decline in operations would have caused us to be out of compliance with certain financial covenants specified in our senior credit facility 
however  on october   we finalized a waiver on all affected financial covenants with our senior bank group 
this waiver to the senior credit facility waived these covenants through february  on january   we amended our senior credit facility to provide more flexibility under certain financial covenants and allow us to extend the maturity from february until february the interest rate on the revolver increases basis points to day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
we currently have no additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
the amendment also sets restrictions on investments and capital expenditures 
the availability under our senior secured credit facility must also be reduced by million on each of the following dates february   june   september  and december  in addition  on january   the availability under our senior credit facility will be further reduced in the amount of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization greater than million  for on january   we amended our credit facility with meristar hospitality to provide financial covenant relief similar to that in our senior credit facility 
the maturity date remains days after the maturity of the senior credit facility 
the interest rate also remains the same  at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
in january  in connection with the execution of the amendment to the revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality  we executed a term note payable to meristar hospitality in the amount of million to refinance our outstanding account payable due to meristar hospitality 
the term note bears interest at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points and matures on the same date as our revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality 
in december  we received notification from the nyse that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the nyse because our average closing share price was less than over a consecutive day trading period 
the nyse s continued listing standards require that we bring our day average closing price and our share price above by june   subject to certain conditions 
we are currently evaluating our alternatives with regard to complying with this standard 
critical accounting policies accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process and are based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from our current judgments 
the most significant accounting policies affecting the company s consolidated financial statements relate to 
the evaluation of impairment of certain long lived assets  
estimation of valuation allowances  specifically those related to income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts  
estimates of restructuring and other accruals  and 
the evaluation of the fair value of our derivative instruments 
impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset including all intangibles may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
in  we recognized million of impairment losses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses in or we review long lived assets for impairment when one or more of the following events has occurred a 
current or immediate short term future twelve months projected cash flows are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows 
b 
the unplanned departure of an executive officer or other key personnel that could adversely affect our ability to maintain our competitive position and manage future growth 
c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator that could affect the value of the goodwill or other long lived assets 
d 
events that could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
in projecting the expected future operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future budgeted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  amounts and use growth assumptions to project these amounts out over the expected life of the underlying asset 
our growth assumptions are based on assumed future improvements in the national economy and improvements in the demand for lodging  if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s actual future operations could be significantly different from the estimated results we used in our analysis 
our operating results also are subject to risks set forth under risk factors operating risks 
valuation allowances we use our judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a million valuation allowance as of december  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this is an allowance against some  but not all  of our recorded deferred tax assets 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
our estimates of taxable income require us to make assumptions about various factors that affect our operating results  such as economic conditions  consumer demand  competition and the other factors that are listed in item  risk factors operating risks and forward looking information 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
based on actual results or a revision in future estimates  we might determine that we would not be able to realize additional portions of our net deferred tax assets in the future 
if that occurred  we would record a charge to the income tax provision in that period 
we also might determine that we would be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets covered by the existing valuation allowance 
if that occurred  we would record a credit to the income tax provision in that period 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our judgment in determining the ability and willingness of our customers to make required payments 
our judgments in determining customers ability and willingness are based on past experience with customers and our assessment of the current and future operating environments for our customers 
if a customer s financial condition deteriorates or a management contract is terminated in the future  this could decrease a customer s ability or obligation to make payments 
if that occurred  we might have to make additional allowances  which could reduce our earnings 
restructuring and other accruals during  the slowing national economy and travel disruptions from the september  terrorist attacks negatively affected our operations 
in response to these events  we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our overhead costs 
these plans included termination of some personnel positions as well as the abandonment of some leases 
we accrued the total estimated cost of the restructuring at the time the plans were finalized and communicated to our employees 
these estimates require our judgment as to the outcome of net lease costs 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to adjust our financial statements when we identify the differences 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into derivative instruments for cash flow hedging purposes to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we have designated our interest rate swap agreements as hedges against changes in future cash flows associated with the interest payments of our variable rate debt obligations 
accordingly  we reflect the interest rate swap agreements at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and we record in stockholders equity the related unrealized gains and losses on these contracts 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
results of operations historical year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  effective january   we assigned our leases with meristar hospitality to taxable subsidiaries of meristar hospitality 
in connection with the assignment  we executed management agreements with the taxable subsidiaries of meristar hospitality for the properties we previously leased from meristar hospitality 
through december   our results of operations included both operating revenue and expenses for these hotels 
beginning january   our results of operations reflect only management fee revenue from these hotels 
therefore  our operating results for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to those for the same period in because of the lease conversions  we believe presenting the pro forma effect showing our results as if the lease conversions had occurred earlier provides a more meaningful view of our operating results 
for comparative purposes  the following table shows the results for the twelve months ended december  on a pro forma basis assuming the leases with meristar hospitality were converted to management contracts on january  these pro forma results are compared to the actual results for the twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts total revenue   operating expenses by department rooms   food and beverage   other operating department expenses   corporate housing   undistributed operating expenses administrative and general   participating lease expense   property operating costs   depreciation and amortization   merger and lease conversion costs   charges to investments in and advances to affiliates  accounts and notes receivable and other  loss on asset impairment  restructuring charges  earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  net income loss   diluted income loss per common share as explained above  through december  we recorded the operating revenues and expenses of the hotels we leased from meristar hospitality in our results of operations 
the pro forma results reverse the effect of recording the operating revenues and expenses of these hotels  and instead reflect the management fee revenue we would have earned from operating those hotels 
since we consider the pro forma operating amounts as a more meaningful comparison to our actual results  we will discuss changes relative to those pro forma amounts rather than our actual reported results 
revenues we earn revenue from leased hotels  management contracts and related services and corporate housing operations 
we recognize revenue from our leased hotels from their rooms  food and beverage and other operating departments as earned at the close of each business day 
our management and other fees consist of base and incentive management fees received from third party owners of hotel properties and fees for other related services we provide 
we recognize base fees and fees for other services as revenue when earned in accordance with the individual management contracts 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we accrue incentive fees in the period when we are certain they are earned 
for contracts with annual incentive fee measurements  we typically will record any incentive fees in the last month of the annual contract period 
the following table shows the operating statistics for our full service managed and limited service leased hotels on a same store basis for the twelve months ended december change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy overall  disruptions in travel patterns and travel safety concerns due to the terrorist attacks on september  and the slowing united states economy had a major negative effect on our managed and leased hotels during the last half of in addition  the travel concerns and a slowing economy have had a negative effect on our corporate housing operations 
we have seen a sharp reduction in both business and leisure travel 
this is reflected in the reduction in revenue per available room and the reduction in occupancy for compared to this slowdown was more pronounced during the third and fourth quarters of on a pro forma basis  our total revenue increased million to million in compared to million in major components of this increase were 
our corporate housing revenue increased by million due to the inclusion of twelve months of bridgestreet operations in  compared to only seven months of bridgestreet operations in 
our revenue from our leased hotels from rooms  food and beverage and other operating departments decreased million  resulting from the disruptions in travel patterns due to travel safety concerns and the slowdown of the economy as discussed above 

our management fee revenue remained stable 
our revenue from existing management contracts was lower than the prior year by approximately million due to the disruptions in travel patterns due to travel safety concerns and the slowdown of the economy as discussed above 
this decline was offset  however  by a million increase in our management fees from flagstone 
we included flagstone s results in our consolidated results beginning january   the time of our  investment  representing ownership and control 
operating expenses by department on a pro forma basis  our operating expenses by department  including room  food and beverage  other operating department expenses and corporate housing increased by million from million in to million in major components of this increase were 
our corporate housing expenses increased million due to the inclusion of twelve months of bridgestreet operations in  compared to only seven months of bridgestreet operations in 
our operating expenses from our leased hotels from room  food and beverage and other department expenses decreased million 
this was a direct result of the decrease in revenue from our leased hotels described above 
undistributed operating expenses our undistributed operating expenses include the following items 
administrative and general  
property operating costs  
participating lease expense  
depreciation and amortization  
loss on asset impairment  merger and lease conversion costs  
charges to investments in and advances to affiliates  accounts and notes receivable  and other  and 
restructuring expenses 
on a pro forma basis our total undistributed operating expenses increased by million from million in to million in major components of this are described in the following paragraphs 
administrative and general expenses are associated with the management of hotels and corporate housing facilities and consist primarily of expenses such as operations management  sales and marketing  finance  information technology support  human resources and other support services  as well as general corporate expenses 
on a pro forma basis  administrative and general expenses increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in expenses attributable to flagstone in and a million increase attributable to bridgestreet in participating lease expense represents base rent and participating rent that is based on a percentage of rooms and food and beverage revenues from the leased hotels 
on a pro forma basis  participating lease expense decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease relates directly to the decrease in revenues from leased hotels 
property operating costs include energy costs  repairs and maintenance  franchise fees  insurance  taxes  management fees and other expenses 
on a pro forma basis  property operating costs increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in expenses related to bridgestreet offset by a decrease in leased hotels costs as a result of decreased revenues from those hotels 
on a pro forma basis  depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to including a full year of bridgestreet s operations in our results  as compared with only seven months of bridgestreet operations in the remaining million increase is attributable to additions to fixed assets and intangible assets during and merger and lease conversion costs of million for  included the expenses related to our proposed merger with american skiing company million and costs related to the conversion of the meristar hospitality leases to management contracts million 
during  we recorded million of additional costs related to the proposed merger with american skiing company 
on march   we and the other parties to the merger agreement mutually agreed to terminate the agreement 
there were no termination fees payable to any of the parties 
the operating expense line item titled charges to investments in and advances to affiliates  accounts and notes receivable  and other includes reserves against accounts and notes receivables and charges to write off the remaining book values of impaired and abandoned assets 
the following is a summary of the amounts comprising the million charge we took in 
during the first quarter of  several of the hotels that we manage experienced severe financial difficulties  which affected the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable from these hotels 
one of the hotel owners filed for bankruptcy 
the lender subsequently foreclosed on this hotel in early july we terminated our management agreement with another hotel owner in the second quarter of as a result  we fully reserved for the amounts due from these entities in the amount of million and recorded a charge to write off other related assets in the amount of million 

we also wrote off our investments in an internet services company and certain real estate ventures 
the internet services company significantly curtailed its operations during the first quarter of we are involved in a dispute with our partners in the real estate ventures and believe that the recorded values of our investments in these real estate ventures have been impaired as a result of this dispute 
we recorded a charge in the amount of million to reduce the book values of these assets 

in connection with the conversion of our lease contracts to management contracts  we implemented changes to our business structure  which resulted in the abandonment of certain fixed assets totaling million 

one of our former partners in our operating partnership claimed that we owed them special distributions under the partnership agreement 
we have estimated the amount of distributions due to the former partner to be  which we accrued at march  and paid later in 
we exited three management contracts in october this resulted in uncollectible management fees and reimbursable expenses 
we fully reserved the amount due from these entities in the amount of  in september we have not collected any amounts on these receivables 
loss on asset impairment includes a write down of intangible assets during in accordance with sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted a review of each property s performance and anticipated future performance and our expected future income from those properties 
as a result of this review  we reduced our expectation for the future performance of some of our leased limited service hotels 
this process triggered an impairment review of our long lived intangible assets associated with these hotels  including goodwill 
the review included analysis of our expected future undiscounted cash flows in comparison to net book value of the long lived intangible assets 
this review indicated that certain long lived assets related to our leased limited service hotels  including goodwill  were impaired 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived intangible assets by using the discounted expected future cash flows generated by the underlying assets 
we reduced the net book value of those long lived intangible assets to their estimated realizable fair value and recorded an impairment loss of million to adjust the goodwill related to our leased limited service hotels 
we incurred restructuring charges of million  consisting of severance related costs and lease termination costs in connection with three separate restructurings during  as described below 
during the second quarter of  we restructured our corporate office as a result of the change to management contracts with meristar hospitality and the termination of the merger agreement with american skiing company

during the third and fourth quarters of  we restructured our corporate housing segment as a result of the slowdown in the national economy and shifted our focus from certain markets

we also realigned and eliminated certain administrative functions to achieve additional cost savings 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in for employee severance costs  lease termination costs and other expenses related to this restructuring 
this restructuring is expected to reduce our annualized net expense by approximately million 

during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million restructuring charge 
this charge is due to additional personnel reductions in our corporate office

our hotel management segment s ebitda increased by million from million in to million in due to the increase in number of properties we managed and leased from to and an increase in ebitda from our existing limited service hotels

the other factors described under the caption  forward looking information 
our financing activities provided million of cash during primarily from net borrowings of million on our credit facilities 
as of february   we had no availability under our senior secured credit facility and approximately million available under our credit facility with meristar hospitality 
this credit facility with meristar hospitality  however  can be amended to provide for potential additional borrowings subject to our compliance with certain leverage ratios as well as approval from meristar hospitality s board of directors 
based on our leverage ratio at february   the credit facility with meristar hospitality could provide up to approximately million of additional borrowings  contingent upon the approval of meristar hospitality s board of directors 
uses of cash we used million of cash in operations during primarily as a result of the reduction in the payable to meristar hospitality  offset by other operating activity 
we used million of cash in investing activities during primarily due to 
million of hotel operating cash transferred to the taxable subsidiaries of meristar hospitality as part of the assignment of the leases on january   and 
million of cash used to acquire bridgestreet paris and management contracts on six hotels 
in january  in connection with the execution of the amendment to the revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality  we issued a term note payable to meristar hospitality in the amount of million  which refinances our account payable to meristar hospitality 
the term note bears interest at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points and matures on the same date as the revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality  which is days after the maturity of our senior secured credit agreement 
revolving credit facilities in  we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality 
this facility was subsequently amended on february  to reduce the maximum borrowing limit to million and to change the maturity date to days after the maturity date of our senior secured credit facility 
this loan contains covenants regarding financial ratios  reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
the interest rate on this facility is variable  based on the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
as of december   we had million outstanding under this facility at an effective interest rate of 
on january   we amended our credit facility with meristar hospitality to provide financial covenant relief similar to that in our senior credit facility 
the maturity date remained at days after the maturity of our senior credit facility 
the interest rate also remained the same  at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
on february   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility among a syndicate of banks 
our senior secured credit facility has only a revolving credit facility and no term facilities 
the interest rate on the facility is the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
the senior secured credit facility originally was to expire in february  with a one year extension at our option 
the senior credit facility contains certain covenants  including maintenance of financial ratios at the end of each quarter  reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
travel disruptions and safety concerns following the terrorist attacks on september  had a significant negative impact on the lodging industry and our operations 
this decline in operations would have caused us to be out of compliance with these financial covenants 
however  effective september   we finalized a waiver of all affected financial covenants with our senior bank group through february  on january   we amended our senior secured credit facility to provide more flexibility with certain financial covenants and allow us to extend the maturity from february until february the interest rate on the facility was increased to the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
we currently have no additional borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
the amendment also sets restrictions on investments and capital expenditures as well as requiring that availability under the facility be reduced by million on february   june   september  and december  in addition  on january   the amount available under the senior credit facility will be further reduced in the amount of our ebitda greater than million  for the interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facility as of december  and  respectively  was and 
we incurred interest expense of million and million on this facility during and respectively 
contractual obligations and maturities of indebtedness we lease some hotels under non cancelable participating leases with remaining initial terms ranging from to years  expiring through the participating leases have minimum base rent requirements 
we also lease apartments for our corporate housing operations and corporate office space 
those leases have terms up to years 
minimum payments due principal only under our debt and lease obligations as of december  as adjusted by the january amendments to our senior credit facility were as follows in thousands revolving credit facility with senior credit meristar hospitality non cancelable facility corporation operating leases total and thereafter   summary during  a significant portion of our cash inflows came from borrowings under our credit facilities 
our lower than expected operating results in required us to negotiate amendments to our credit facilities 
these amendments imposed restrictions that may limit our ability to execute our business strategy and increase the risk of default under out debt obligations 
while we believe our current business plan and operating expectations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  a significant decline in our operations could leave us unable to use our senior credit facility to supply needed liquidity 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in the winter and early spring 
since the majority of our hotels are non resort properties  our operations generally have reflected non resort seasonality patterns 
we expect to have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters  although the disruptions caused by the september  attacks and their aftermath may cause disruptions to this pattern 
corporate housing activity traditionally peaks in the summer months and declines during the fourth quarter and the first part of the first quarter 
we expect to have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow from corporate housing in the first and fourth quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our credit facilities 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in april  we entered into a million  one year interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution to hedge against the effect future interest rate fluctuations may have on our floating rate debt 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the day london interbank offered rate at

in the event that we will have large transactions requiring currency conversion we will reevaluate whether we should engage in hedging activity
