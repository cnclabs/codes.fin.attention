item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro biotherapeutics  inc you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  referred to as the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  production and licensing of complex natural product pharmaceuticals as well as the development and licensing of novel genomic technologies for applications in human therapeutics and diagnostics  pharmacogenomics and agrobiotechnology 
our lead product is paclitaxel  a naturally occurring chemotherapeutic anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew  or taxus trees 
in addition to our efforts with paclitaxel and genomics  we are also working on several types of compounds that have promising activity as anti cancer agents 
we believe some of these agents function by novel mechanisms  which may increase their likelihood of success as new chemotherapeutics 
we are also actively engaged in evaluating the in licensing or purchase of potential new products and or technologies  whether or not those products or technologies are derived from natural products 
our evaluation of new products and technologies may involve the examination of individual molecules  classes of compounds  or platform technologies  in both cancer and other therapeutic areas 
acquisitions of new products or technologies may involve the purchase of such products or technologies  or the acquisition of  or merger with  other companies 
we continue to incur substantial expense for research and development related to improvement of paclitaxel yield  production cost reduction  development of our semisynthesis process  genomics research and development  and development of other potential drugs 
accordingly  we have incurred significant losses  including losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect that we will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with our paclitaxel biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
we anticipate that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as we are able to generate sufficient sales to support our operations 
primarily  our ability to generate sufficient sales to support our operations depends upon the successful completion of our paclitaxel development program 
our strategy for that program has been to form strategic alliances through long term exclusive agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
on july   we entered into an exclusive collaborative agreement of up to years covering the us and canada with abbott laboratories to develop and commercialize one or more formulations of paclitaxel for the treatment of a variety of cancers 
under our agreement with abbott  we are responsible for supply of bulk drug  development activity is conducted jointly 
abbott is responsible for finishing  regulatory filings  marketing  and sale of the finished drug product 
most primary decisions related to the paclitaxel development program are made by a joint abbott napro development committee 
in march we and abbott filed an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with the us food and drug administration  or fda  for paclitaxel 
in connection with the abbott agreement  we may receive  including million received through december   total funding of up to million in the form of up to million in development milestones  up to million in marketing milestones  million in secured debt  and million in equity investments 
through april abbott had purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of million 
we received an initial million fee from abbott in july contingent upon our successful achievement of all development milestones  we could receive up to an additional million in development fees 
should we receive approval of our current anda  and upon commencement of commercial sales  we will receive a portion of such million 
we have received million of secured debt from abbott 
the debt bears a primary interest rate of and is due in full on the earlier of i the second anniversary of the first sale of finished product by abbott to a wholesaler or end user customer following approval of finished product by the fda  ii the termination of the abbott agreement  or iii january  the debt is limited to a borrowing base of collateralized assets  recomputed monthly 
the majority of our hard assets are security for the debt 
contingent upon receiving regulatory approval and achieving certain commercial sales thresholds over several years  we may receive additional milestone payments from abbott of up to million 
we cannot assure that regulatory approval or sales thresholds necessary to trigger any of the future milestone payments will be achieved 
under terms of the agreement  abbott purchases bulk drug from us 
if the paclitaxel product is approved and commercialized  abbott will pay a percentage of its net paclitaxel sales to us  less abbott s payments for purchase of bulk drug 
abbott may terminate the agreement at any time with or without cause 
should abbott terminate without cause  it is obligated to make payments to us 
in we entered into a year exclusive agreement with fh faulding co  ltd  a large australian pharmaceutical company  for the clinical development  sale  marketing and distribution of paclitaxel 
faulding actively markets anti cancer pharmaceuticals and other health care products in europe  australia  asia  south america  and other regions throughout the world 
in  we amended the faulding agreement to  among other things  add additional countries to faulding s exclusive territory 
in we entered into a separate agreement with faulding covering development and sale of paclitaxel in europe 
including the new agreement for europe  the faulding territory includes substantially all of the world other than the us  canada  japan  israel  the former soviet union and parts of africa 
faulding has received marketing approval for  and is selling paclitaxel as anzatax tm in more than countries 
in europe  we are responsible for regulatory filings and will supply paclitaxel exclusively to faulding to formulate and finish the product 
we cannot assure that we will receive regulatory approval in europe 
should we receive approval  faulding will then market and sell the final proprietary paclitaxel formulation in europe 
under the agreement  faulding paid an up front licensing fee to us of million 
we will share equally the net sales of the product in europe 
in january we received approval in israel to sell paclitaxel under the trade name biotax tm 
we have established an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with tzamal pharma for the development and distribution of paclitaxel in israel 
the israeli ministry of health has approved biotax for use in treating a variety of cancers 
in june we and jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
entered into a mutually exclusive development  supply and distribution agreement for paclitaxel in japan 
under the agreement  we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the finished drug 
jcr and we will jointly be responsible for the clinical and regulatory program necessary for seeking approval to market paclitaxel in japan 
jcr will fund the clinical and regulatory program 
jcr will be responsible for the sales and distribution of the product in japan upon its approval 
jcr  headquartered in ashiya  japan  is a research and development oriented pharmaceutical manufacturer  focusing on the research of bioactive substances such as enzymes  hormones  enzyme inhibitors  growth factors and stimulating factors 
it is also engaged in the development and research of bioengineered products such as recombinant human growth hormone 
in anticipation of final fda approval for commercial sales  we have purchased land in boulder county  colorado  for the possible construction of new manufacturing and headquarters facilities 
we have substantially expanded  and continue to expand  our existing manufacturing facilities 
we cannot assure  however  that we will receive regulatory approval of paclitaxel in the us  europe or japan or that we and our strategic partners will successfully market it 
we anticipate financing the construction and expansion with new capital  either in the form of debt or otherwise  if available on acceptable terms  although we cannot assure that we will be able to do so 
research and development development and research are major focuses for us 
we discuss the nature and status of our development and research in depth in item business  in the general  paclitaxel overview  paclitaxel development  biomass  manufacturing  strategic alliances  competition  patents and proprietary technology  government regulation and product approvals  and research and development sections  and in the general section of this item we have incurred the following expense on research and development projects oncology genomics our development and research activity is subject to change as we develop a better understanding of our projects and their prospects 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the timing or the cost of the effort necessary to complete the projects  the estimated completion dates or the timing of commencement of material net cash inflows from the projects 
we have included the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development on schedule in the special note regarding forward looking statements  below 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up million from sales to abbott and tzamal for were million and million  up million and million from cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was million  up million from the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in volume million and an increase in unit production cost million 
the unit production cost increased as we rapidly expanded capacity by modifying equipment for increased volume and by adding shifts  resulting in training and other start up cost 
we anticipate that as the volume related modifications are assimilated and staff is fully trained  our unit production cost will decrease 
however  we cannot assure that this will occur 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  up million from genomics research and development was million of the increase  oncology was the other  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  up million from the increase is attributable primarily to increased regulatory expense million  increased compensation  and increased consulting expense 
asset writedowns 
asset writedowns for were million  down  from in we recorded a million writedown of production equipment in the boulder extraction facility related to operations that we have transferred to a lower cost third party vendor 
we expensed preliminary engineering and design cost of a considered new production facility when we determined that we could expand capacity in our existing facilities sufficiently to meet demand in at least the near future 
the amount was attributable to prior construction cost that was not applicable in the redesign of the manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado 
license fee income 
license fees for were million 
there was no similar amount in although license fees and milestone payments are unusual and may be non recurring  million was received under the faulding european agreement and million under the jcr pharmaceutical japanese agreement 
the income represents amortization of these payments 
interest income 
interest income for was  up  from the increase was primarily attributable to higher overall balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million  up  from the increase was primarily attributable to a million higher balance on the abbott loan 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up  from sales to faulding for were million  up million from the increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of countries in which faulding was licensed to sell paclitaxel 
sales to ivax ended in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was million  up  from the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in volume million and start up cost associated with the extraction facility  offset by a reduction in unit production cost million 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  up million from oncology research and development was million of the increase  genomics was the other  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  up million from the increase is attributable primarily to increased compensation  increased regulatory expense and increased recruiting expense 
asset writedowns 
asset writedowns for were million  up million from the increase was attributable to prior construction cost that had no applicability in the redesign of the manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado 
license fee income 
license fees for were million 
there was no similar amount in the amount included million in milestone payments under the abbott agreement 
the remainder of the license fees were paid by ivax corporation 
we expect no further payments from ivax 
interest income 
interest income for was  up  from the increase is primarily attributable to higher overall balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest and other expense for was  the same as decreased interest on the senior convertible debt because of the final conversion was offset by interest on the abbott loan 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have been  and will continue to be  significant 
as of december   we had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million as of december  to date  we have funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock of approximately million  with private placements of equity securities of approximately million  with the exercise of warrants and options of million and with net borrowing of million 
in february we sold privately million of common stock issued at per share and million principal value of five year debentures convertible into common stock at per share 
no placement agent was involved in the transaction 
our net proceeds were  we subsequently filed with the sec to register the resale of the shares under the securities act of we may pay the debenture interest in cash or common stock at our option 
the debentures automatically convert into common stock during the first two years if the average price of the common stock for trading days is  and during the last three years if the average price for trading days is if we have insufficient funds to repay the debentures in full at maturity or upon acceleration  the holders of the debentures may elect to convert the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest on the debentures into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the then current twenty day average trading price of the common stock 
the conversion price of the common stock in such a circumstance could be materially below the price at which we otherwise would be willing to issue our common stock 
issuance of common stock at such a price could result in substantial dilution to our other stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we believe existing capital and projected sales will provide adequate capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures in however  pharmaceutical development is a costly and time consuming process 
we may in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost of acquiring and developing such resources  and related capital expenditures  may be very large 
as a result  we may seek additional capital 
if us approval of our anda for paclitaxel is significantly delayed  we may need to seek additional capital 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such capital 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash used by operations of million and by investing activity of million was offset by financing activity of million 
inventory was million at december  the amount of work in process inventory and finished goods inventory is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of our strategic partners  our production planning for meeting those needs  and the timing of seasonal biomass harvests 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
we anticipate that the level of our accounts receivable may increase significantly as we anticipate the regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel in the us capital expenditures we spent million during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included manufacturing capacity expansion  plantation cost  laboratory equipment purchases and land acquisition 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the cost of manufacturing expansion for paclitaxel  the development of new products  the acquisition of new products or technologies  the cost of manufacturing resources for new products  the nature of our relationship with our strategic partners  the progress of our research and development programs  changes in manufacturing processes  the magnitude and scope of these activities  competing technological and marketing developments  and changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships 
in we anticipate significant expenditures for improving efficiency and expanding capacity at our existing facilities 
the expanded scope of our research and development activity will require significant additions to laboratory equipment 
all of these factors  and others  lead us to expect a continued high level in capital expenditures in although we may seek additional long term financing to fund the increases in capital expenditures  we cannot assure that we can obtain such financing on terms which are acceptable to us 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
tax law provides limits on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards if there has been a change of ownership as described in section of the internal revenue code 
such a change of ownership may limit our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  and could be triggered by sales of securities by us or our stockholders 
critical accounting policies we have identified certain accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this item where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates policy in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we use estimates and assumptions 
actual results could vary from the estimates we use 
comment our accounting processes require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of expense during the reporting period 
we cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
inventory policy we state inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
plantation cost policy we have determined the cultivation of renewable sources of biomass to be used in the manufacture of paclitaxel is a technically feasible business strategy 
paclitaxel is a naturally occurring cancer fighting compound found in certain species of yew taxus trees 
we capitalize plantation expenditures incurred prior to the first commercial harvest on each planting of trees 
plantation expenditures include the acquisition cost of trees and the related cost of planting and growing 
we deplete such cost using estimated units of production over the expected number of annual harvests  six to eight 
the number and timing of harvests can vary depending on product demand 
the recovery of plantation cost may be dependent on approval by the us food and drug administration  or fda  of our paclitaxel 
delay or lack of fda approval among other circumstances could cause us to consider the possibility of impairment of our plantation cost in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement any such impairment could be material to our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets policy we review the carrying amount of long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates long lived assets will not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount of these long lived assets to estimated fair value or discounted cash flow  as appropriate 
comment on inventory  plantation cost and other long lived assets policies we have invested substantial amounts of capital in these assets 
our accurate measurement and evaluation of these assets is important to the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines regarding capitalization of cost  market valuation  and potential impairment of these assets  and provide any necessary allowances as required

we do not intend to update these statements and undertake no duty to any person to make any update under any circumstance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  we sold a significant amount of paclitaxel to faulding 
under the faulding agreement  faulding pays us a fixed percentage of their sales price for paclitaxel 
each year  faulding estimates the sales price it will receive in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  we determine the price we will charge faulding 
we recognize the corresponding sales at the time of shipment to faulding 
however  faulding s actual selling price may differ from that estimated 
in the summer  faulding provides us with their calculation of the actual sales price for sales made during the preceding year  and an adjustment is calculated that may increase or decrease our sales of products to faulding during that year 
faulding s sales are made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sells paclitaxel 
as a result  our sales are affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the past  currency fluctuations were a significant factor in reductions in the price we charged faulding 
if changes in foreign currency markets continue to cause a decrease in the price per gram we receive from faulding  there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow 
our sales to jcr  if any  are subject to the same risk
