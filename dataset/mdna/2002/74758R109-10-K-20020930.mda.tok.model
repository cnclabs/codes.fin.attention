part i item business introduction we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
tape libraries consist of cartridge tape drives  storage arrays of tape cartridges and robotics to move the tape cartridges from their storage locations to the tape drives under software control 
our tape libraries provide storage solutions for organizations requiring backup  recovery and archival storage of critical electronic information 
our tape libraries also can provide near online storage as an alternative to disk drives 
our products are compatible with commonly used network operating systems  including unix  windows nt  netware and linux 
our tape libraries also are compatible with a wide range of storage management software packages  such as those supplied by computer associates  legato  tivioli and veritas 
we offer tape libraries for multiple tape drive technologies  including those using advanced intelligent tape  dlt  and lto tape drives and media 
we sell our tape libraries worldwide  primarily to value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
these customers integrate our products with software from third party vendors to provide storage solutions  which they in turn resell to end users 
we custom configure each of our libraries based on each customer s individual requirements  with a normal delivery time of one to three working days 
this rapid fulfillment of customer orders allows our resellers to minimize their inventory levels and allows us to compete effectively with the industrial distribution channels used by our competitors 
our seven senior operations executives have worked in the computer and data storage industries for an average of approximately years each 
based on this experience  we have the ability to bring new products to market in response to changing market conditions and new opportunities as they arise 
qualstar was incorporated in california in to develop and manufacture ibm compatible track reel to reel tape drives for the personal computer and workstation marketplace 
in  we entered the tape automation market with a series of tape libraries incorporating mm tape drives 
since that time  we have introduced a succession of tape library models designed to work with other tape drive technologies and tape media formats 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  approximately of revenues for fiscal  and approximately of revenues for fiscal sales of track tape drives  services and other products accounted for the balance of our revenues 
industry background storing  managing and protecting data has become critical to the operation of many enterprises as the world economy becomes increasingly information dependent 
the data storage industry is growing in response to the increase in the amount of data that is generated and must be preserved 
the amount of data has been increasing due to the growth in the number of computers  the number  size and complexity of computer networks and software applications  and the emergence of new applications such as image processing  e commerce  internet services  medical  video and motion picture image storage  and other multi media applications 
in addition  businesses continue to generate increasing amounts of traditional business information with respect to their products  customers and financial information 
this increase in the amount of data that is generated stimulates increases in the demand for data storage and the management of this data 
factors driving growth in data the following factors are contributing to the growth in data storage increased demand from internet and e commerce businesses 
the growth in the internet and e commerce has created businesses that depend on the creation  access and archival storage of data 
we believe that the need to utilize databases will continue to grow as individuals and businesses increase their reliance on the internet for communications  commerce and data retrieval 
growth in new types of data 
the growth in data is being fueled not only by the increase in information but also in the types of stored data 
for example  storage of graphics  audio and mp  video  medical and security images  and multi media uses such as video on demand  require far greater storage capacity than text and financial data 
growth in the critical importance of data 
corporate databases contain useful information about customer records  order patterns and other factors that can be analyzed and transformed into a valuable asset and a competitive advantage 
the ability to efficiently store  manage and protect this information is important to the value and success of many businesses 
the usefulness of past and present data is further enhanced by new sophisticated data mining software applications that can access and analyze large databases 
growth in network server computing applications and data 
the use of server based computer networks has shifted critical information and applications to network servers in order to allow more people to gain access to stored data as well as to create new data 
as the speed of network computing has increased  numerous new applications have become feasible such as computer fax  e mail and voicemail  all of which generate progressively more data 
organizations increasingly are aware of the need to protect this data as networks become a mission critical element of many operations 
decrease in the costs of storing data 
the costs of data storage have decreased with advances in technology and improved manufacturing processes 
we expect these costs to continue to decrease 
decreases in costs not only encourage the storage of more data  but also make it more cost effective to add storage capacity rather than to remove old data  contributing to greater storage demand for data which in the past may have been purged periodically 
advances in storage management technologies the growth in data and need for storage is contributing to an evolution in traditional storage solutions 
new open standard technologies are designed to provide high speed connectivity for data intensive applications across multiple operating systems  including unix  windows nt  netware and linux 
these new methods of storage and data management technologies include the following fibre channel 
fibre channel is an interface technology based on industry standards for the connection of storage devices to networks 
interface is the term used to describe the electronics  cabling and software used to facilitate communications between devices 
with fibre channel  users are better able to share stored information with other storage devices and servers over longer distances  with data transfer speeds significantly faster than the most common interface technology in use today  thereby increasing the importance of storage area networks 
storage area networks 
storage area network  or san  architecture applies the inherent benefits of a networked approach to data storage applications  which allows data to move efficiently and reliably between multiple storage devices and servers 
the benefits of san architecture also include increasing the expandability of existing storage solutions and providing a higher level of connectivity than currently exists with traditional technologies 
additionally  sans are able to provide these benefits across multiple operating systems 
advanced storage management software 
the development of advanced storage management software has led to the use of tape as a lower cost alternative to disk drives for on line storage 
this software automatically migrates infrequently accessed data to the lower cost storage medium such as a tape library 
a user s request for this data at some later date will recall the data automatically from the tape library and put it back on the disk file for user access 
this sometimes is referred to as near online storage 
this process reduces the overall storage cost by using the least expensive storage medium to save data that is not expected to be needed on a frequent basis 
advances in storage management software have increased the ability of businesses to store  manage and retrieve important data  which in turn allows businesses to operate more efficiently 
network attached storage 
current storage devices are dependent on a file server for all commands and control 
network attached storage devices give storage devices file server functionality  which allow users to plug a storage library directly into a network without increasing demands on the file server or requiring a separate file server 
this allows users to maintain  or even enhance  system performance while saving on both time and cost 
types of data storage current non volatile storage solutions are based primarily on three technologies magnetic disk  optical disk and magnetic tape 
each of these solutions represents a compromise among a variety of competing factors including capacity  cost  speed  portability and data reliability 
magnetic tapes are removable  which allows them to be transported easily to an off site location for security or protection from natural disasters 
magnetic and optical disks provide quicker access to stored data and generally are used when speed is important 
less frequently used data often is migrated from magnetic or optical disks to tape storage 
tape libraries provide a near online solution  where less frequently used data files are stored on tapes instead of on disks 
tape libraries and applications automated tape libraries speed the tape loading process  eliminate errors induced by human operators  and enhance security compared to tapes that must be retrieved and loaded manually 
tape libraries also are capable of being operated from a remote location or during off hours when no attendant is on duty 
automated tape libraries are a key component of a network administrator s overall storage solution 
tape drives and tape media are two key components of tape libraries 
the costs of tape drives and tape media have declined with advances in technology  and we expect this trend to continue 
as prices decline  new applications for automated storage become justified  further increasing the number of applications that can benefit from the use of tape libraries 
we believe that continued technological improvements in tape drives and tape media will further reduce overall storage costs in the future 
current and emerging applications for tape libraries include automated backup 
backup is the creation of a duplicate copy of current data for the purpose of recovery in the event the original data is lost or damaged 
an automated tape library  in conjunction with storage management software  can backup network data at any time without human intervention 
a library with multiple tape drives can backup data using all of its drives simultaneously  thus significantly speeding up the recording process 
backup tapes can be removed from the library and stored in an off site location for protection against a physical or natural disaster at the primary site 
archiving 
archiving is the storage of data for historical purposes 
when important information is stored on tape  automated tape libraries  in conjunction with storage management software  can catalog tapes for future retrieval and prevent unauthorized removal or corruption of data by using password or key lock protection 
archival tapes provide a historic record for use in fraud detection  audit  legal and for other purposes 
tape libraries also are used for archiving because of the benefits offered by the tape medium  such as long term data integrity  resistance to environmental contamination  ease of relocation  and low cost 
additionally  the availability of write once read many or worm tapes and tape drives is expected to be used in archiving processes where data once written cannot be modified 
digital video 
digital recording of camera images for surveillance and security purposes is beginning to replace traditional analog vhs recording in mid size to large installations such as airports  retail stores  government facilities and gaming operations 
this is a growing and increasingly important market opportunity because tape libraries eliminate the need for operators to load  unload  store and retrieve the vast number of tapes created in these facilities 
library based systems index  store and play back the video images on demand  thereby reducing the recall time and cost of operation significantly when compared to vhs recording and playback devices 
digital recording technology provides enhanced resolution and accommodates the recording of transactional data such as cash register transaction data and credit card data alongside the video image  which is not possible with vhs recording technology 
image management 
storage intensive applications such as satellite mapping and medical image management systems are turning to tape libraries because of the cost advantage over traditional storage methods 
x ray images or mri results  for instance  must frequently be kept on file for years 
tape library storage of a digitized image costs considerably less than storing a film copy  and can be recalled years later with considerably less effort 
additionally  there is a trend to require that these records be kept available for longer periods of time 
distribution of tape library products the requirements for storage solutions vary depending on the size of an enterprise  the type of data generated and the amount of data to be stored 
with the increased dependence on stored data  most organizations  regardless of their size  have a heightened need for storage solutions that integrate devices such as tape drives  tape libraries and storage management software 
those organizations with sufficient in house information technology resources can rely on their internal infrastructure and expertise to design  purchase and implement their own storage solutions 
these organizations may elect to purchase equipment from distributors or directly from original equipment manufacturers 
many organizations  however  do not have sufficient in house resources but often have the same need for data storage solutions 
these organizations often look to value added resellers to design  supply and install their storage solutions 
value added resellers develop and install storage solutions for enterprises that face complex storage needs but lack the in house capability of designing and implementing the proper solution or have chosen to outsource these functions 
typically  the value added reseller will select among a variety of different hardware technologies and storage management software options  as well as provide installation and other services  to deliver a complete storage solution for the end user 
value added resellers require rapid turnaround of orders  custom configuration of tape libraries  drop shipment to their customer s site  compatibility with multiple tape formats and storage management software  and marketing and technical support 
we expect the market segment served by value added resellers to increase as the cost of tape library storage continues to decline and as more organizations choose to outsource their information technology functions 
original equipment manufacturers generally resell products made by others under their own brand name and typically assume responsibility for product sales  service and support 
original equipment manufacturers enable manufacturers  such as qualstar  to reach end users not served by other reseller distribution channels and to serve select vertical markets where specific original equipment manufacturers have exceptional strength 
original equipment manufacturers require special services such as product configuration control  extensive qualification testing  custom colors and private labeling 
our solution we offer storage solutions that respond to the growing data management challenges facing businesses today  while addressing the unique needs of value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
we believe that high product reliability is important to the end users of our products due to the critical nature of the data that is being stored  shorter time periods available for back up operations  and the operation of backup systems during hours when personnel may not be available to respond to problems 
to address these concerns  we emphasize quality and reliability in the design  assembly and testing of our products which reduces the potential for product failures and results in products that require little maintenance 
the technology utilized within automated tape libraries is continuously evolving due to advances in data recording methods  component cost reductions  advances in semiconductor and microprocessor technologies  and a general trend toward miniaturization in the electronics industry 
this changing technology requires that we continuously develop and market new products in order to prevent our product lines from becoming obsolete 
to give a few examples  this year we completed development of our q link tm remote library management tool  our gigabit per second fibre channel interface option  and our exclusive variable i o port feature 
the q link tm remote library management tool enables administrators to manage multiple qualstar tape libraries from one centralized location using a standard web browser 
our gigabit per second fibre channel option essentially doubled the performance of our existing fibre channel solution 
the variable i o port was introduced to allow it administrators the ability to select the number of cartridge slots which can be dedicated to bulk import or export of media to or from the library 
our tape libraries are compatible with over forty third party storage management software packages  such as those supplied by computer associates  legato  tivoli and veritas 
storage management software enables network administrators to allocate the use of storage technologies among user groups or tasks  to manage data from a central location  and to retrieve  transfer and backup data between multiple workstations 
we believe that storage management software is a crucial component of any automated storage installation  and the lack of compatibility is a significant barrier to entry for new tape library competitors 
to ensure compatibility  our engineers work closely with the application software vendors during product development cycles 
we do not have contracts with any application software vendors  nor do we need access to their software code to design our products 
we maintain relationships with them by supplying evaluation tape libraries so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries and by evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries 
we also support our relationships with them by keeping them informed as to current and contemplated changes to our products and by referring business to them when value added resellers or end users inquire about software sources 
we have focused our business primarily on supporting value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers as the most effective and profitable distribution channels for our tape libraries 
our solution is to offer our resellers reliable tape libraries  multiple tape format choices  and more attractive profit opportunities than do other tape library manufacturers 
we custom configure each of our libraries based on the resellers requirements  with a normal delivery time of one to three working days 
our solution for original equipment manufacturers is to offer them control over product design changes  qualification testing  custom colors and private labeling 
we believe these factors enhance the resellers and original equipment manufacturers ability to sell our products and encourage them to remain loyal to qualstar 
strategy our goals are to enhance our position as a supplier of automated tape libraries and to increase our market share in each of the tape formats in which we compete 
to achieve these goals  we intend to offer libraries for multiple tape drive technologies 
we offer tape libraries for a range of tape drive technologies  including advanced intelligent tape  digital linear tape dlt  and linear tape open  or lto ultrium tape media formats 
by offering products based on multiple tape drive technologies  we reduce our dependence on the success of any single technology and can offer products that target the specific preferences of resellers and their end user customers 
focus distribution on value added reseller channels 
we sell our products primarily through selected value added resellers who have a strong market presence  have demonstrated the ability to work directly with end users  and who maintain relationships with major vendors of storage management software 
because we market our products primarily through this channel  we have implemented a variety of programs to support and enhance our relationships with our reseller partners 
these programs are designed to increase the likelihood of closing a sale and to increase the reseller s profit margins 
we intend to maintain our marketing presence in support of this distribution channel 
we conduct business with our value added resellers on an individual purchase order basis and no long term commitments are involved 
additionally  there are no exclusive territories assigned to our value added resellers 
maintain and strengthen original equipment manufacturer relationships 
we sell our products to several companies under private label or original equipment manufacturer relationships 
original equipment manufacturer sales enable us to reach some end users not served by our value added resellers 
the same product characteristics that make our tape libraries attractive to value added resellers also are important to original equipment manufacturers 
we will continue to pursue and develop opportunities with original equipment manufacturers 
we conduct business with our original equipment manufacturer customers on an individual purchase order basis and no long term commitments are used 
develop libraries for new tape technologies 
the tape drive industry is continuously advancing the state of technology 
we will continue to monitor new product releases and design new libraries for those technologies that appear promising and meet our standards for capacity  quality and reliability 
increase our rate of innovation 
we plan to increase research and development resources in order to exploit emerging technologies and product opportunities 
we intend to continue the expansion of our product lines to incorporate higher capacities and new technologies 
we believe that our experience  efficiency and strict control over the development and manufacturing of new products are key factors in the successful execution of our strategy 
we design our tape libraries with a high percentage of common parts  use quality components and minimize the number of moving parts 
we utilize proprietary techniques in the design  production and testing of our libraries in order to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce our costs 
we produce all of our products at a single facility and control our inventory closely to provide rapid delivery to our customers 
these steps allow us to design and bring to market new products rapidly in response to changing technology  and maintain our profitability 
products tape libraries we offer a number of tape library families  each capable of incorporating one or more tape drive technologies  as summarized in the following table product family models in product family tape drive technology range of tape cartridges maximum capacity in terabytes tls sony ait  ait to tls quantum dlt to quantum sdlt  to tls lto to cls sony ait  ait rls sony ait  ait a terabyte is one million megabytes  or one thousand gigabytes 
the table shows native capacity and excludes gains from data compression  which can increase capacity by more than 
some of our tape library product families include a number of models that differ in storage capacity  price and features 
our libraries are installed in network computing environments ranging from small departmental networks to enterprise wide networks supporting hundreds of users 
we believe that selling products for multiple tape drive technologies insulates us somewhat from the dynamics of the marketplace as various tape standards compete for market share 
this helps our products appeal to the broadest possible range of end user market segments 
this wide range of products makes us a one stop supplier for our value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer customers  enabling them to meet most end user requirements for a specific tape format 
our wide range of products for competing tape drive technologies also helps to insulate us from the occasional supply shortages from tape drive or tape media manufacturers 
tape libraries generally contain two or more tape drives and from seven to thousands of tapes 
we concentrate our product offerings in the middle segment range of to tapes 
we design our tape libraries for continuous  unattended operation 
multiple tape drives allow simultaneous access to different data files by different users on the network  and increase the rate at which data can move on to  out of  or within the network 
a library with multiple tape drives can back up data using all drives simultaneously  significantly speeding up the recording process 
within the library  tape cartridges sometimes are stored in removable magazines  allowing for bulk removal of the tapes 
most of our libraries also offer key features such as barcode readers to scan cartridge labels  and an input output port for importing and exporting individual tapes under system control 
many of our library models are expandable after installation by increasing the number of tape storage positions 
this feature provides the end user with the ability to increase data capacity as storage needs grow 
we offer automated tape libraries with different data storage capacities and data transfer rates 
we continue to develop and release new libraries to expand our product offerings to meet the changing demands of the marketplace 
in addition  we continue to develop enhancements and improvements for our existing products in order to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace 
our tape libraries incorporate a number of specialized features that we believe improve reliability  serviceability and performance  including rapid tape drive replacement 
we design our libraries so that a tape drive can be replaced quickly without special tools 
this feature minimizes the off line time required when a tape drive must be replaced  and frequently avoids the high cost and delays of a service call 
fibre channel connectivity 
we offer a or gigabit per second fibre channel option on most of our models to meet the needs of storage area networks and other high performance applications 
closed loop servo control 
our tape libraries use digital closed loop servo control for robotic motion to provide precise tape handling 
this yields robotic motion that is smooth  repeatable and highly reliable 
brushless motors 
we use only brushless electric motors in our tape libraries 
motors are a key component in any robotic system 
brushless motors provide longer life and less electrical noise compared to conventional brush type motors 
we build many of our own motors in order to obtain optimum performance  and reliability 
variable i o port 
our new viop feature allows it administrators the ability to select the number of cartridge slots which can be dedicated to bulk import or export of media to or from the library 
remote management 
many larger companies with global back up solutions or disaster management programs require tape libraries that can be put off site in various regions but must be administered from a single location 
with our new q link tool  our customers have the ability to put our products anywhere in the world and manage them from a single administrative hub using a standard web browser 
our flagship product line  the tls series  is specifically designed to be placed on the floor or on a table top  without the need for a special equipment rack 
if requested  we provide our customers with an adapter kit for mounting in a rack 
other manufacturers design libraries primarily for rack mounting  and supply an adapter for table top use 
we have chosen our approach to distinguish ourselves from many of our competitors 
we believe that this approach provides the most convenient and lowest cost solution for the largest segment of our customer base 
recently we commenced shipments of the first model in our planned rls series of tape libraries 
these products are designed to fit conveniently in equipment racks and provide back up capacity in only five standard units  or a total of inches of rack space 
in addition  the rls was designed to allow for dual redundant power supplies as well as hot swappable tape drives 
we believe these features will give the rls series of tape libraries a competitive advantage over other compact rack mount tape libraries that do not offer as robust a combination of features 
we believe this product will provide a convenient solution for a large portion of our customer base 
other products we have manufactured track auto loading reel to reel tape drives since demand for track tape drives has been declining for many years  and we expect overall demand for track tape drives to continue to decline in the future 
therefore  this year we announced the end of the life for track tape drives 
in addition to our tape libraries and track tape drives  we sell ancillary products such as tape media  tape magazines  cables  bar code labels and adapters for rack mounting our products 
in july of  we purchased the assets and intellectual property of npower  inc  a privately held company located in newbury park  california 
npower designs the smallest and most efficient open frame switching power supplies available today based upon its patented technology 
since the purchase  npower has been relocated to our facility in simi valley  california 
npower products are utilized within our tape libraries as well as sold on the open market primarily to oem customers 
sales and marketing sales we sell our tape library products primarily through value added resellers 
our direct sales force usually will initiate contact with value added resellers who might be likely candidates to sell our tape libraries 
we strive to develop relationships with resellers who have expertise in storage management applications  established relationships with end users and the experience to understand and satisfy their customers needs 
we believe that by selling directly to value added resellers  we have an advantage over competitors who force resellers to purchase through distributors and who sometimes sell directly to end users  thereby competing with their own resellers 
some of the advantages of our strategy include the following higher profit margins 
by avoiding the extra distribution markup  higher profit margins are available to be shared by both us and the reseller 
custom configurations 
by circumventing the distribution step  we are able to offer custom configurations of our products  such as special paint  private branding and non standard interface options  on very short notice 
channel conflicts avoided 
we refer all end user inquiries to our reseller partners 
because they know that we will not sell directly to the end user  there is an attitude of cooperation between the reseller and us 
frequently  our sales representatives make end user visits with the reseller to answer questions or help close the sale 
credit 
we typically extend credit to resellers if they meet our credit requirements 
rapid delivery 
we generally ship a product to the reseller within one to three working days of confirming an order  rivaling the delivery time of many distributors 
we have relationships with over value added resellers  and approximately forty independent storage management software vendors 
our sales are made on an individual purchase order basis 
although we sell our tape libraries primarily to value added resellers  we believe that original equipment manufacturers are an important element of our business 
we strive to work with original equipment manufacturers early in the product development cycle so that we can obtain valuable product development feedback 
the sales cycle for original equipment manufacturers generally encompasses six months to one year and involves extensive product and system qualification testing  evaluation  integration and verification 
most of our sales of automated tape libraries to original equipment manufacturers are in the video surveillance and medical imaging segments 
original equipment manufacturers typically assume responsibility for product sales  service and support 
our sales are spread across a broad customer base  with our largest original equipment manufacturer  loronix information systems  a division of verint systems  accounting for of revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and of revenues in fiscal stornet  inc  historically our largest value added reseller accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  of revenues in fiscal  and of revenues for the fiscal year ended june  our international sales efforts are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
european sales are coordinated through our european sales office in frankfurt  germany 
we intend to continue to develop our international markets and create additional outlets for our products 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states were million  or of revenues in fiscal  million  or of revenues in fiscal  and million or of revenues in fiscal marketing we support our sales efforts with a broad array of marketing programs designed to generate brand awareness  attract and retain qualified value added resellers and inform end users about the advantages of our products 
we provide our resellers with a full range of marketing materials  including product specifications  sales literature  software connectivity information and product application notes 
we train our resellers to sell our products and to answer customers questions 
we advertise in key network systems publications such as sys admin  infostor  lanline  integrated solutions and others  and participate in trade shows 
we display our products under the qualstar brand name at various trade shows including the comdex fall trade show  and participate in other trade shows in partnership with our principal suppliers and resellers 
we support our marketing and customer service with a website that features comprehensive marketing and product information 
another element of our marketing plan is our lead registration program 
this program awards value added resellers that uncover sales opportunities and promote our products to the end user 
in exchange for this effort  the reseller is rewarded with a higher profit margin on that particular sale 
the lead registration program gives our reseller partners an advantage over their competitors who purchase from distribution channels 
our direct sales force conducts seminars targeting end users  often with a sales representative from one of the storage management software vendors 
in addition  we conduct sales and technical training classes for our resellers 
we also conduct various promotional activities for resellers and end users  including product specific rebates 
customer service and support we believe that strong customer service and support is an essential aspect of our business 
our customer service and support efforts consist of the following components technical support 
our technical support personnel are available monday through friday during normal business hours 
technical support personnel are available to all customers at no charge by telephone  facsimile and e mail to answer questions and solve problems relating to our products 
our technical support personnel are trained in all aspects of our products 
our support staff is located at our headquarters in simi valley  california 
we sell service contracts for on site service of our tape libraries installed within the united states  which are fulfilled by ibm and anacomp 
sales engineering 
our engineers provide both pre and post sales support to our resellers 
systems engineers typically become involved in more complex problem solving situations involving interactions between our products  third party software  network server hardware and the network operating systems 
systems engineers work with resellers and end users over the telephone and  in certain situations  visit the customer s site 
training 
we offer a product maintenance training program for end users  value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer maintenance personnel 
we conduct our training classes at our headquarters  as well as on site at the locations of our value added resellers or original equipment manufacturers 
warranty 
the standard warranty period on our tape libraries is three years 
during the first year we offer immediate replacement of defective products at no charge  subject to availability and credit approval of the purchaser 
the purchaser is responsible for returning the defective product to us in a timely manner without damage 
after the first year  the customer must first ship the tape library to our factory  where we will service the product during the warranty period at no charge 
we offer out of warranty factory service at a flat fee plus applicable taxes  duties and transportation costs 
for library tape drives  we pass the drive manufacturer provided warranty on to our reseller 
on site service for library products is available within the united states and some foreign countries for an extra charge 
we contract with outside service providers to supply on site service 
revenues from the sale of on site service contracts and out of warranty repair have not been significant 
manufacturing and suppliers we manufacture our products at our facility in simi valley  california 
the cls is purchased from an outside supplier 
we currently operate three assembly lines during one daily eight hour shift 
as needs require  we have the ability to add a second or third shift to increase our capacity 
in order to respond rapidly to sales orders  we build our tape libraries to a semi finished state in advance of receipt of an order  perform full testing and then place the tape libraries in a holding area until an order is received 
once an order is confirmed  we remove the unit from the holding area  install tape drives and configure the unit to meet the specific requirements of the order  retest and then ship 
the manufacturing cycle to bring the tape libraries to a semi finished state is approximately five working days 
we believe that this capability represents an effective way to control our inventory levels while maintaining the ability to fill specific customer orders in short lead times 
we coordinate inventory planning and management with suppliers and customers to match our production to market demand 
once we confirm a product order  we generally ship the product to the customer within one to three working days 
we believe this response time is among the fastest in the industry  and gives us a competitive edge 
because we fill the majority of our orders as they are received  our backlog generally is small and is not indicative of future sales 
we select our suppliers carefully based on their ability to provide quality parts that meet our specifications and volume requirements 
inventory planning and management is coordinated closely with suppliers to match our production needs 
many of the components assembled into our libraries are standard off the shelf parts  which reduces the risk of part shortages and allows us to maintain inventory of these parts at a minimum 
a number of our component parts are not available off the shelf  but are designed to our specifications for integration into our products 
tape drives and tape recording media are available only from a limited number of suppliers  some of which are sole source providers 
some of our suppliers compete with us by selling their own tape libraries 
the risk of allocation is greater upon the introduction of a new tape drive technology 
any disruption in supplies of tape drives or tape media could delay shipments of our products 
we have experienced only one situation involving a limited supply of components 
between january and january  sony electronics  inc  our sole source supplier of advanced intelligent tape drives and tape media  was unable to provide us with sufficient quantities of gigabyte tape media to meet our order volume 
during this period  our customers generally did not delay purchases of advanced intelligent tape libraries from us because of this shortage  but accepted delivery of tape libraries with a partial shipment of gigabyte tape media or accepted gigabyte tape media  which was available 
competition the market for automated tape libraries is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
because we offer a broad range of libraries for different tape drive technologies  we tend to have a large number of competitors that differ depending on the particular format and performance level 
we compete in a segment of the overall tape library market that focuses on small to mid range network computing environments 
our principal competitors in this market segment include storagetek  quantum atl products  advanced digital information corporation  exabyte  overland data  and spectra logic 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  better name recognition  larger research and development staffs  and more capabilities in manufacturing  marketing and distributing products than we do 
our competitors may develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our products 
we are not iso certified  unlike some of our competitors  which may limit some customers ability to purchase our products 
however  we do not believe that our current determination not to seek iso certification has affected our sales to date 
as a greater number of competitors introduce products in a particular tape drive technology  the increased competition normally results in price erosion  a reduction in gross margins and a loss of market share for all competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not cause a reduction in our sales or profit margins 
we believe that our ability to compete depends on a number of factors  including the success and timing of new product developments by us and by our competitors  compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems  product performance  reliability  price  and customer support 
specifically  we believe that the principal competitive factors in the selection of a tape library include reliability of the robotic assembly that handles the tape cartridges  initial purchase price  storage capacity  speed of data transfer  compatibility with existing network operating systems and storage management software  after sale expandability of a tape library to meet increasing storage requirements  expected product life and cost of maintenance  and physical configuration and power requirements of the library 
we believe our tape libraries compete favorably overall with respect to these factors 
research and development our research and development group of people consists of two engineering teams who have data storage and related industry experience 
our original team located in simi valley  california  has developed over separate tape library models for ten different tape formats over the last six years 
this year we began our advanced development group in boulder  colorado 
they are responsible for the design and development of our next generation of tape libraries 
our engineers are a diverse and robust group that have the capability to meet the needs of a complex and demanding data storage market 
our research and development efforts rely on the integration of multiple engineering disciplines to generate products that meet market needs in a competitive and timely fashion 
successful development of automated tape libraries requires the integration of mechanical design  electronic design packaging  and firmware design into a single product 
product success also relies on the engineering group s thorough knowledge of each of the different tape drive technologies  as well as scsi and fibre channel interface technologies 
we frequently develop new products in response to the availability of new tape drive technology 
as tape drive manufacturers compete in the marketplace  they continually invest in research and development to gain performance leadership either by offering increasingly enhanced versions of their current tape drive products or by introducing an entirely new tape drive technology 
we benefit from these industry developments by utilizing the new technology in our products 
our engineers work closely with various tape drive manufacturers through the drive development cycle to assure that reliable tape library and tape drive combinations are brought to market 
the design architecture of our tape libraries makes use of common parts across most product families giving us the ability to develop and introduce new products quickly 
if a new tape drive is an advanced version of one already incorporated in one or more of our products  our time and dollar investment to incorporate the new drive can be relatively small  with the primary focus being on verification testing 
when the form factors differ  the time and investment requirements can grow substantially  and may require development of a new product family altogether 
we also develop new products as we identify emerging market needs 
our sales and marketing  product development and engineering groups identify products to fulfill customer and marketplace needs 
our research and development group concentrates on leveraging previous engineering investments into new products 
for example  our firmware is based on successive generations of the operating system developed for our first library 
we also use common parts in our different library series  and leverage our electro mechanical and electronic hardware technology from previous products into next generation designs 
in some cases  entire subassemblies are transferable  leveraging not only engineering time but also materials purchasing  inventory stocking and manufacturing efforts 
our research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million for the year ended june  we anticipate increasing our spending on research and development in the future  to increase the flow of new products to market 
intellectual property we rely on copyright protection of our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property provides significant protection from competition 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the tape storage industry  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our personnel  and timely new product introductions 
we enter into nondisclosure agreements with our development engineers to protect our technology and designs 
however  we do not believe that such protection can preclude competitors from developing substantially equivalent products 
employees as of september   we had full time employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in customer service  in sales and marketing  and in finance and administration 
we also employ a small number of temporary employees and consultants as needed 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other similar agreement 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees 
risk factors our principal competitors devote greater financial and marketing resources to developing and selling automated tape libraries 
consequently  we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share 
we face significant competition in developing and selling automated tape libraries 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
we have significantly fewer financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than many of our competitors and these limited resources may harm our business in many ways 
for example  in recent years several of our competitors have acquired other tape library companies  increased the geographic scope of their market  offered a wider range of tape library products  and acquired proprietary software products that operate in conjunction with their products and the products of their competitors 
in the future  our competitors may leverage their greater resources to develop  manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to our products  attend more trade shows and spend more on advertising and marketing  reach a wider array of potential customers through a broader range of distribution channels  respond more quickly to new or changing technologies  customer requirements and standards  or reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share 
we believe competitive pressures are likely to continue 
we cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources 
if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully  our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease 
we have a limited number of executives 
the loss of any single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
the success of our business is tied closely to the managerial  engineering and business acumen of our existing executives 
william j 
gervais  our president  has been largely responsible for the development of most of our tape libraries  has overseen our operations and growth  and established and maintained our strategic relationships 
we expect that he will continue these efforts for the foreseeable future 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate key executives and other key personnel  many of whom have been instrumental in developing new technologies and strategic plans 
however  our current dependence on a limited number of executives  for whom replacements may be difficult to find  entails a risk that we may not be able to supervise and manage our ongoing operations 
our suppliers could reduce shipments of tape drives and tape media 
if this occurs  we would be forced to curtail production  our revenues could fall and our market share could decline 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of our revenues in fiscal  approximately of our revenues for fiscal year  and approximately of our revenues for the year ended june  we depend on a limited number of third party manufacturers to supply us with the tape drives and tape media that we incorporate into our automated tape libraries 
several tape drive manufacturers  including sony corporation  quantum corporation  and hewlett packard  compete with us by also manufacturing tape libraries 
there can be no assurance that other tape drive manufacturers will not also begin to manufacture libraries 
historically  some of these suppliers have been unable to meet demand for their products and have allocated their limited supply among customers 
if suppliers limit our supply of tape drives or tape media  we may be forced to delay or cancel shipments of our tape libraries 
the major supplier risks we face include the following sony electronics  inc is our sole source supplier of millimeter advanced intelligent tape tape drives and media 
sony has allocated some of their products and may allocate them again in the future 
in the fiscal year we derived million  or  of our revenues  in fiscal we derived million  or  of our revenues  and in fiscal we derived million  or of revenues from the sale of libraries  tape drives and tape media based on sony advanced intelligent tape technology 
if sony reduces its sales to us or raises its prices  we could lose revenues and our margins could decline 
quantum corporation is our sole source supplier of dlt and sdlt tape drives and competes with us as a manufacturer of automated tape libraries 
in the past  quantum has allocated quantities of tape drives among its customers 
it is possible that quantum will allocate again  and as a result  may be unable to meet our future dlt and sdlt tape drive requirements 
the linear tape open standard was developed by an industry consortium consisting of ibm  hewlett packard and seagate 
lto is intended to compete with mm and other half inch tape drives and media 
ibm and hewlett packard both manufacture and sell automated tape libraries that utilize lto tape drives and compete with our products 
therefore  even if we receive adequate allocation  it may be at a price that renders our products uncompetitive 
our other suppliers have in the past been  and may in the future be  unable to meet our demand  including our needs for timely delivery  adequate quantity and high quality 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our significant suppliers 
the partial or complete loss of any of our suppliers could result in lost revenue  added costs and production delays or could otherwise harm our business and customer relationships 
our revenues could decline if we fail to execute our distribution strategy successfully 
we distribute and sell our automated tape libraries through value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers  and intend to continue this strategy for the foreseeable future 
value added resellers integrate our tape libraries with products of other manufacturers and sell the combined products to their own customers 
original equipment manufacturers combine our tape libraries with their own products and sell the combined product under their own brand 
we currently devote  and intend to continue to devote  significant resources to develop these relationships 
a failure to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with value added resellers or original equipment manufacturers could limit our ability to grow or sustain our current level of revenues 
our focus on the distribution of our products through value added resellers poses the following risks we may reach fewer customers because we depend on value added resellers to market to end users and these value added resellers may fail to market effectively or fail to devote sufficient or effective sales  marketing and technical support to the sales of our products  we may lose sales because many of our value added resellers sell products that compete with our products 
these value added resellers may reduce their marketing efforts for our products in favor of products manufactured by our competitors  and our costs may increase as value added resellers generally require a higher level of customer support than do original equipment manufacturers 
we depend upon our original equipment manufacturer customers ability to develop new products  applications and product enhancements that incorporate our products in a timely  cost effective and customer friendly manner 
we cannot guarantee that our original equipment manufacturer customers will meet these challenges effectively 
original equipment manufacturers typically conduct substantial and lengthy evaluation programs before certifying a new product for inclusion in their product line 
we may be required to devote significant financial and human resources to these evaluation programs with no assurance that our products will ever be selected 
in addition  even if selected by the original equipment manufacturer  there generally is no requirement that the original equipment manufacturer purchase any particular amount of product or that it refrain from purchasing competing products 
we do not have any exclusive or long term agreements with our value added resellers or original equipment manufacturers  who purchase our products on an individual purchase order basis 
if we lose important value added resellers or original equipment manufacturer customers  if they reduce their focus on our products or if we are unable to obtain additional value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers  our business could suffer 
we rely on tape technology for all of our revenues 
our business will be harmed if demand for storage solutions using tape technology declines or fails to develop as we expect 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from products that incorporate some form of tape technology 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from these products for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will continue to be subject to the risk of a decrease in revenues if demand for these products declines or if rising prices make it more difficult to obtain them 
if storage products incorporating technologies other than tape gain comparable or superior market acceptance  our business could be harmed 
two customers account for a significant portion of our sales and they have no minimum or long term purchase commitments 
our revenues and earnings may decrease if we lose business from these customers 
loronix information systems  a division of verint systems inc  accounted for of our revenues during fiscal  of revenues during fiscal  and of our revenues during fiscal stornet  inc  our largest value added reseller  accounted for of our revenues during fiscal  during fiscal  and of our revenues during fiscal we cannot assure you that these customers will continue to purchase our products in the quantities they have purchased in the past  or at all 
our revenues and earnings may decrease if any of the following factors were to occur relating to either of these customers any financial difficulties of the customer that results in its inability to pay amounts owed to us 
stornet  our largest var  has had financial difficulties and as a result  we believe that it is unlikely they will continue as a re seller of our products 
due to their difficulties  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal the loss of the customer due to competition from other vendors or consolidation  or substantial cancellations of orders by the customer  or the receipt of orders significantly below historical or anticipated levels 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate in the future due to several factors  including reductions in the size  delays in the timing  or cancellation of significant customer orders  fluctuations in product mix  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us  our original equipment manufacturer customers or our competitors  expansions or reductions in our relationships with value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer customers  financial difficulties affecting our value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers that render them unable to pay amounts owed to us  the rate of growth in the data storage market and the various segments within it  timing and levels of our operating expenses  and availability of tape media 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this  in the aggregate  may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
our lack of significant order backlog makes it difficult to forecast future revenues and operating results 
we normally ship products within a few days after orders are received 
consequently  we do not have significant order backlog and a large portion of our revenues in each quarter results from orders placed during that quarter 
because backlog can be an important indicator of future sales  our lack of backlog makes it more difficult to forecast our future revenues 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  unexpected fluctuations in revenues could negatively impact our quarterly operating results 
if we fail to develop and introduce new tape libraries on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our products do not contain the features required by the marketplace  we will eventually lose market share and sales to more innovative competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the future success of qualstar will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology  to develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis  and to introduce  manufacture and achieve market acceptance of these new and enhanced products 
in particular  our success will depend on the market acceptance of our recently introduced rls family of automated tape libraries 
the rls is our next generation of automated tape libraries designed for the rackmount automated tape library marketplace 
the rls and the tls families of tape libraries are facing increasing competition from automated tape library products and likely will face competition from other types of storage devices that may be developed in the future 
development schedules for high technology products are inherently subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance we will be able to meet our product development schedules or that our development costs will be within budgeted amounts 
if the products or product enhancements developed are not deliverable due to technical problems  quality issues or component shortages  or if such products or product enhancements are not accepted by the marketplace or are unreliable  then our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new storage technologies or the adoption of an industry standard different than our current product standards could render our existing products obsolete 
we depend upon independent software developers to provide software that integrates our libraries with computer operating systems 
the utility of an automated tape library depends partly upon the storage management software  which supports the library and integrates it into the user s computing environment to provide a complete storage solution 
we do not develop and have no control over the development of this storage management software 
instead we rely on independent third party software developers to develop and support this software 
accordingly  the continued development and future growth of the market for our products will depend partly upon the success of software developers to meet the overall data storage and management needs of tape library purchasers and our ability to maintain relationships with these firms 
although we do not have contracts with any independent software developers  we maintain relationships with them by supplying evaluation tape libraries so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries  evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries  keeping them informed as to current and contemplated changes to our products  and referring business to them when value added resellers or end users inquire about software sources 
our customers have the right to return our products in certain circumstances 
an excessive number of returns may reduce our revenues 
our customers have days from the date of purchase to return our products to us for any reason 
we may otherwise allow product returns if we think that doing so maximizes the effectiveness of our sales channels and promotes our reputation for quality and service 
although we estimate and reserve for potential returns in our reported financial results  actual returns could exceed our estimates 
if the number of returns exceeds our estimates  our financial results could be harmed for the periods during which returns are made 
we may spend money pursuing sales that do not occur when anticipated or at all 
many of our original equipment manufacturer customers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new models of tape libraries 
this evaluation process is lengthy and may range from six months to one year or more 
this process is complex and may require significant sales  marketing  engineering and management efforts on our part 
the process becomes more complex as we simultaneously qualify our products with multiple customers or pursue large orders with a single customer 
as a result  we may expend resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships  if at all 
we sell a significant portion of our products to customers located outside the united states 
currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our revenue or profitability 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
our foreign sales subject us to a number of risks  including political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or our ability to market our products in foreign countries  although we denominate our international sales in us dollars  currency fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  greater difficulty of administering business overseas may increase the costs of foreign sales and support  foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our products  longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the profitability of foreign sales  and our current determination not to seek iso certification  a widely accepted method of establishing and certifying the quality of a manufacturer s products  may reduce sales 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales or profitability 
we may have to expend significant amounts of time and money defending or settling product liability claims arising from failures of our tape libraries 
because our tape library customers use our products to store and backup their important data  we face potential liability if our products fail to perform 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage could reduce our profitability or cause us to discontinue operations 
a failure to develop and maintain proprietary technology may negatively affect our business 
we rely on copyright protection of our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property rights provide significant protection from competition 
as a consequence  these rights may not preclude competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
in addition  many aspects of our products are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore can be reproduced by our competitors 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in recent years  there has been an increasing amount of litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in these proceedings in the future 
we have from time to time and in the future may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using our products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology  which redesign may be either economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
undetected software or hardware flaws could increase our costs  reduce our revenues and divert our resources from our core business needs 
our tape libraries are complex 
despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes  we may not be able to control and eliminate manufacturing flaws adequately 
these flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with a newly introduced product  a new version of an existing product  or a product that has been integrated into a network storage solution with the products of other vendors 
the variety of contexts in which errors may arise may make it difficult to identify the source of a problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  or damage our reputation 
to address these risks  we frequently revise and update manufacturing and test procedures to address engineering and component changes to our products 
if we fail to adequately monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays  repair or replacement costs or damage to our reputation 
product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts 
significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business 
our officers and directors could implement corporate actions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole 
our executive officers and directors own beneficially  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these shareholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interests of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as shareholders  may lead them to vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as shareholders per se and thus from the interests of other shareholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and require shareholders to give advance notice if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for shareholder approval 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price  and the voting and other rights of the holders  of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends and therefore you will only be able to recover your investment in our common stock  if at all  by selling the shares of the stock that you own 
we historically have pursued a policy of reinvesting our earnings in research and development  expanding our value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer relationships  and expanding our manufacturing capabilities 
consequently  we have never paid dividends on our shares of capital stock 
we intend to continue this policy for the foreseeable future to strengthen our financial and competitive position in the tape library market 
item properties qualstar leases all of the facilities used in our business 
our headquarters  manufacturing  tls and rls engineering  and n power are located in a single building containing approximately  square feet located in simi valley  california 
our lease on this facility expires in february  with an early termination option becoming available in february of rent on this facility is  per month  with step ups ranging from  to  per month every two years

overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
we offer tape libraries for multiple tape drive technologies  including those using advanced intelligent tape  dlt  sdlt  and linear tape open  or lto  tape drives and media 
many enterprises now routinely manage very large databases  in addition to storing information on local desktop computers 
this  coupled with the growth in the amount of data from new sources and applications  is increasing the need for managing and storing data efficiently 
anticipating the increased demand for large libraries  we developed a family of tape libraries over the last seven years spanning a broad range of tape formats  prices  capacity and performance 
our product mix has changed over the last five fiscal years as we introduced new products to address additional tape formats and changing customer preferences 
for example  during fiscal year  we introduced a new rack mount library compatible with ait technology 
we expect our product mix to continue to evolve in the future in response to emerging tape technologies and changing customer preferences 
we have developed a network of value added resellers who specialize in delivering storage solutions to end users that are installed complete and ready to operate 
end users of our products range from small businesses requiring simple automated backup solutions to large organizations needing complex storage management solutions 
we also sell our products to original equipment manufacturers 
we assist our customers with marketing and technical support 
our international sales efforts are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
european sales are coordinated through our european sales office in frankfurt  germany 
we intend to continue to develop our international markets and create additional outlets for our products 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states were million  or of revenues in fiscal  million  or of revenues in fiscal  and million  or of revenues in fiscal net revenues include revenues from the sale of tape libraries  library tape drives  storage media  and ancillary products 
ancillary revenues include service and repair  net of the cost of any third party service contracts  extended warranty revenues  and track tape drives  which we announced end of life in fiscal year automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  and of revenues in fiscal  and of revenues in fiscal sales of services and other products accounted for the balance of our revenues 
gross margins depend on several factors  including the cost of manufacturing  product mix  customer demand and the level of competition 
larger tape libraries provide higher gross margins than do smaller tape libraries primarily because of strong customer demand and less competition 
our gross margins have benefited from a shift in demand towards our larger tape libraries 
however  some customers of larger tape libraries desire significant quantities of tape media 
sales of large quantities of tape media partially offset the higher gross margins associated with sales of larger tape libraries because tape media provide significantly lower gross margins than tape libraries 
from time to time  we have been unable to meet demand for tape media because of supply constraints 
we may experience higher gross margins in quarters when sales of tape media decrease due to supply constraints and lower gross margins in quarters when sales of tape media increase due to greater availability 
we expect that our growth in revenues and attractive gross margins will encourage new competitors to enter our marketplace  which may affect our gross margins 
research and development activities include the design and development of new products  as well as enhancements to existing products 
in an effort to increase the flow of new products to market  we will continue to increase our spending on research and development activities 
to this end  we recently established the advanced development group in boulder  colorado 
this group is focusing on the development of our next generation family of automated tape libraries 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal  exclusive of bad debt expenses  due to the increasing cost of employee benefits and the higher cost of being a public company  such as increased premiums for directors and officers liability insurance  and legal and accounting fees and expenses 
we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal  representing the difference between the exercise prices of the options and restricted stock awards granted to employees and directors during fiscal and the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
amortization of the deferred compensation was approximately  during fiscal   during fiscal  and  during fiscal  which was recorded as general and administrative expenses in the statements of income 
total deferred compensation amortization will approximate  in fiscal  and  in fiscal these approximations may vary if individuals to whom the deferred compensation amounts relate leave prior to fiscal results of operations the following table reflects  as a percentage of net revenues  statements of income data for the periods indicated years ended june  net revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing

revenues for the year ended june  were million  a decrease of compared to net revenues of million for the year ended june  the decrease in revenues was due primarily due to an overall decline in the data storage market  which reflects the softness seen in the global economy 
revenues from tape libraries and related media decreased to million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  from million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  selling prices of our libraries remained relatively stable during fiscal however  selling prices of mm library tape drives declined during fiscal  whereas half inch library tape drives increased in overall selling price 
the decline in selling prices of mm tape drives was attributable to reduced costs for these drives from our supplier  which were passed through to our customers in the form of lower selling prices 
half inch library tape drives increased in selling price due to the introduction of new  more expensive lto and dlt tape drives 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of revenues  for the year ended june   compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  purchased parts  depreciation of plant and equipment  rent  utilities  and packaging costs 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was primarily caused by product mix 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of engineering salaries  benefits  purchased parts and supplies used in development activities 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to costs associated in bringing our new rack mount library to market 
in addition  we opened an advanced development office in boulder  colorado 
although not fully operational at june   there were nominal costs incurred in establishing this research and development facility during fiscal we anticipate that research and development expenses will significantly increase in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  sales commissions  trade show costs  advertising  technical support and travel related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of revenues for the year ended june   as compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended june  this decrease was due primarily to the decrease of commissions paid to our sales force as a result of lower sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include employee salaries and benefits  deferred compensation related to equity incentives  provisions for doubtful accounts and returns  and professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses was caused primarily by an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million primarily due to the potential insolvency of a large customer 
investment income 
investment income decreased to million in the year ended june  as compared to in the year ended june  this decrease was due to primarily to a poor performing economy in which overall interest rates have been low partially offset by an increase in funds available for investment 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million  or of pre tax income  for fiscal compared to million  or of pre tax income  for fiscal the increase in the percentage of the provision for income taxes to pre tax income was primarily due to a higher than anticipated state apportionment factor for california income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
revenues are recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  less estimated returns  for which provision is made at the time of the sale 
revenues for the year ended june  were million  an increase of compared to net revenues of million for the year ended june  this increase in revenues was due primarily to increasing demand for our existing tape library models 
revenues from tape libraries and related media increased to million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  from million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  partially offsetting the increase in revenues from our tape libraries was a decrease of million in revenues from our track tape drives to million for the year ended june  from million in the year ended june  we expect sales of track tape drives to continue to decline  as this product line is near its end of life 
selling prices of our libraries remained relatively stable during fiscal however  selling prices of tape media and library tape drives declined during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in selling prices of tape media and drives was the result of ait tape drives and media being placed in general distribution by the manufacturer 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of revenues  for the year ended june   compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  purchased parts  depreciation of plant and equipment  rent  utilities  and packaging costs 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was primarily caused by declines in selling prices of tape media and library tape drives coupled with an increase in sales of those products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of engineering salaries  benefits  purchased parts and supplies used in development activities 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries resulting from an increase in departmental headcount and for research and development of new products and new features of our existing products

general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses were caused by one time expenses of  associated with the move to our new facility  increased costs of being a publicly traded company such as directors and officers insurance and investor relations expenses  higher rent as the result of our move to a new facility  and higher salaries and benefits for administrative staff 
the year ended june  also includes deferred compensation amortization expense of  related to equity incentives  as compared to only  of deferred compensation amortization expense in the year ended june  impairment of investment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in chaparral network storage  inc exceeded its net realizable value as a result of rapid changes in technology and the availability of capital for further development of its family of products 
accordingly  we recognized an allowance in the amount of  to reduce the carrying value of the investment in chaparral to zero 
investment income 
investment income increased to million in the year ended june  as compared to  in the year ended june  this increase was due to a full year of investment of the initial public offering proceeds 
in addition  net cash generated by our operations in fiscal was invested in interest bearing securities 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million  or of pre tax income  for fiscal compared to million  or of pre tax income  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our capital requirements with cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in each of these periods  operating cash was provided primarily by net income 
during fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was primarily used to fund increases in receivables and inventory 
in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was primarily used to fund increases in inventories and the purchase of marketable securities 
in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was primarily used to purchase marketable securities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal related primarily to our investment of million for an approximately interest in chaparral network storage  inc  a provider of fibre channel interfaces 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal and related primarily to purchases of marketable securities as well as equipment and leasehold improvements 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of june  are as follows in thousands due in due in and due in and due thereafter total operating lease obligations total we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may utilize cash to invest in businesses  products or technologies that we believe are strategic 
we regularly evaluate other companies and technologies for possible investment by us 
in addition  we have made and expect to make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
however  we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses or technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer promotional offers  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty costs  investments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock in simi valley  california 
in general  these customers are allowed to return the product  free of penalty  within days of shipment 
after days  customers generally are not allowed to return product to us without a restocking fee 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns based on past experience and current knowledge of our customer base 
our experience has been such that only a very small percentage of libraries are ever returned 
should our experience change  however  we may require additional allowances for sales returns 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  if the financial condition of our customers for which we have already established allowances were to improve  then their ability to make payments to us would be less impaired  potentially making such allowances unnecessary 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology changes more rapidly than expected  or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
likewise  if technology changes more slowly than expected  or market conditions become more favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may become unnecessary 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluation of product failure rates  material usage and estimation of service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we do not currently record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidelines on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized for their estimated useful lives 
we expect to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and do not expect the adoption of the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or result of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application encouraged 
we expect to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and do not expect the adoption of the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or result of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quanitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we have no outstanding debt nor do we utilize derivative financial instruments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
