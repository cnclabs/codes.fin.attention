overview we are a leading domestic designer  marketer and distributor of a broad range of branded  high quality small appliances under well recognized brand names such as salton r  george foreman tm  toastmaster r  breadman r  juiceman r  juicelady r  white westinghouse r  westinghouse r  farberware r  melitta r  russell hobbs r  tower r  haden r and pifco r 
we believe that we have the leading domestic market share in indoor grills  toasters  juice extractors  bread makers  griddles  waffle makers and buffet ranges hotplates and a significant market share in other product categories 
we outsource most of our production to independent manufacturers  primarily in the far east 
we also design and market tabletop products  time products  lighting products and personal care and wellness products under brand names such as block china r  atlantis r crystal  sasaki r  calvin klein r  timex r timers  ingraham r  westclox r  big ben r  spartus r  stiffel r  ultrasonex tm  relaxor r  carmen r  hi tech r  mountain breeze r and salton r 
we predominantly sell our products to mass merchandisers  department stores  specialty stores and mail order catalogs 
we also sell certain of our products directly to consumers through infomercials and our internet website 
we market and sell our products primarily in the united states and europe through our own sales force and a network of independent commissioned sales representatives 
the general slowdown in the retail sector  which began during our second fiscal quarter of  has continued to have an adverse effect on our sales  operating profit and net income 
we continue to experience a shift in our customers buying patterns from higher priced products to lower price point promotional products 
although this was somewhat abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are unsure of the longer term pattern of purchases of our customers 
our wide range of products at different price points has allowed us to adapt to this shift in buying patterns 
this shift to lower priced products also lowered gross margins as opening and mid price point products generally have lower gross margins than our higher price point products 
also  we have had to spend additional promotion and advertising dollars to maintain our market presence 
our products  and our market leading position in so many categories  gives us a solid foundation to actively face the difficult economic environment 
the results for the fiscal year include pre tax charges of million related to three legal settlements discussed below  million in reserve increases related to certain trade and royalty receivables  and million associated with exiting certain product lines 
these lines include cookware and large outdoor gas grills 
the results for fiscal include pre tax charges of million related to inventory losses  million in lifo charges  and million related to the bankruptcy of ames department stores 
as a result of complaints from a few retailers concerning our allocation in and of certain george foreman tm grills  we have entered into an agreement with the attorney generals of new york and illinois governing our future conduct with retailers relating to our indoor electric grills 
we expect all  or nearly all  of the other states to join in this agreement 
although we believe that we acted in compliance with longstanding antitrust principles  we entered into this agreement to resolve this matter without the distractions and costs of a lengthy investigation and likely litigation 
the agreement with the attorney generals provides for us to make a payment of million upon final approval of the agreement and two additional payments of million each on march  and  respectively 
all of these payments are contingent on states representing at least of the national population entering into the settlement agreement 
we also entered into a settlement agreement with applica  inc to settle all outstanding claims against each other 
the principal features of the settlement are the cancellation of the obligations on our balance sheet with respect to the promissory note which we issued to applica in  which note has a face value of million and a carrying value prior to the settlement of approximately million and an accounts payable balance of million  the termination of our obligation to pay applica a fee based upon our net sales of white westinghouse r products to kmart  the agreement by applica to be responsible for the payment of any losses or settlements relating to claims made by a former sales representative of salton  the grant by a subsidiary of applica to salton of a royalty free license to use certain technology relating to electric toasters  the payment by salton to applica of million on or before december  and million on or before june   and a mutual release by the parties 
we also settled the litigation brought by advantage partners  the licensee of popeil inventions 
advantage partners claimed that our foreman tm rotisserie ovens infringed certain patents held by advantage 
the settlement we entered into entitles salton and all of our retail customers to sell the rotisserie ovens without fear of future litigation and effectively grants to us the right to use all of the patents on rotisserie ovens held by advantage partners 
in april  we announced we had signed an exclusive licensing agreement with westinghouse electric corporation to use its westinghouse r brand name  circle w trademark  and the brand awareness statement you can be sure 


if it s westinghouse r on certain product categories in north america  south america  africa  europe  asia  and australia new zealand

the launch includes a series of innovative  technologically advanced vacuums under the westinghouse r brand and will feature a wireless upright vacuum cleaner 
this product will be bagless  eliminate the need for a cord while vacuuming  and provide comparable suction power to a corded vacuum cleaner 
we also plan to introduce two corded upright vacuum cleaners that feature bagless technology and hepa filtration 
additionally  we announced the introduction of a new line of smart  networked home appliances  under the westinghouse r brand  that will interface with the internet via a information center called a gateway device designed by salton and powered by microsoft windows ce 
net 
the new line of products will include the gateway device  breadmakers  convection ovens  and coffee makers  among other planned future products

in march  we announced the appointment of david m 
mulder to the newly created position of executive vice president and chief administrative officer 
mr

in august  we announced the acquisition of the westclox r  big ben r and spartus r brands from the bankrupt general time corporation  until recently the largest producer and marketer of alarm  wall and occasional clocks in north america 
under the terms of the acquisition  we agreed to purchase all of the trademarks  molds  intellectual property  rights and patents related to these select brands for million 
in addition  we agreed to purchase certain inventory related to these brands held in the us  europe and canada 
in august  we appointed martin burns to oversee the operations of salton europe formerly pifco holdings plc 
martin most recently served as managing director of morphy richards at the glen dimplex group  a manufacturer of electrical heating and small kitchen appliances in the united kingdom 
on july   we announced the appointment of dr 
bruce j 
walker to our board of directors  increasing the board to eight members 
dr 
walker currently serves as dean and professor of marketing at the college of business at the university of missouri columbia 
on june   we acquired pifco holdings plc  a united kingdom based producer and marketer of a broad range of branded kitchen and small appliances  personal care and wellness products  cookware and battery operated products 
our operating results for fiscal include the operating results of pifco from june  through june  in fiscal we renamed pifco holdings plc to salton europe ltd 
on january   we acquired toastmaster  a columbia  missouri based marketer of kitchen and small appliances and time products 
through toastmaster  we design  market and service a wide array of kitchen and small appliances and time products under the brand names toastmaster r and ingraham r 
our operating results for fiscal include the operating results of toastmaster from our acquisition date of january  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and intangible assets 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  publicly available information regarding our customers and the inherent credit risk related to them  information from subscription based credit reporting companies  trade association data and reports  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs may be required  resulting in write offs that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventory valuation 
our inventories are generally determined using the last in  first out lifo cost method 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  and regularly review the book value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine if these items are properly valued 
if market value is less than cost  we write down the related inventory to the lower of market or net realizable value 
we regularly evaluate the composition of our inventory to determine slow moving and obsolete inventories to determine if additional write offs are required 
changes in consumer purchasing patterns  however  could result in the need for additional write offs 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits and other claims related to product and other matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain reserves and or accruals for such costs that may be incurred  which are determined on a case by case basis  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the reserves and accruals are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated for new developments or new information as appropriate 
intangible assets 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of february  are not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
intangible assets that have an indefinite life are also periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
independent valuation consultants are employed by us to assist in determining if and when intangible assets might be impaired 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques  which are based on estimated future operating results 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
in fiscal  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and  as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill as well as  million of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform at least an initial impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended june  june  july  net sales cost of goods sold distribution expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses legal expenses  net operating income year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales in the fifty two weeks ended june  fiscal were million  an increase of approximately million or  compared to net sales of million in the fifty two weeks ended june  fiscal 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales of products under the george foreman tm  stiffel r  toastmaster r  aircore r  farberware r  melitta r and other brands 
these increases in sales were partially offset by decreases in sales of products under the white westinghouse r product line  primarily sold to kmart  as well as reductions primarily in sales of juiceman r  salton r  maxim r and magic chef r brands 
sales of new product lines  primarily under the westclox r  spartus r  big ben r and look for brands and the addition of a full year of sales of product and brand names acquired in connection with salton europe  also helped offset the sales decreases 
much of the sales increases occurred in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal with particularly strong sales of products under the george foreman tm  toastmaster r  stiffel r and farberware r brands  as well as strong sales of products and brand names acquired in connection with salton europe and westclox r 
the fourth quarter of fiscal only included one month of results from salton europe 
net sales of the white westinghouse r brand to kmart approximated of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal cost of goods sold during fiscal decreased to of net sales compared to in fiscal gross profit increased slightly  primarily from an improvement in sales of higher priced items with higher gross margins  particularly george foreman tm products  russell hobbs r products and rejuvenique r products and a reduction in sales of white westinghouse r products which generally have lower gross margins  partially offset by an increase in distribution expenses  million for reserve increases related to certain trade and royalty receivables and million associated with the exiting of certain product lines 
gross profit for fiscal was reduced by million related to inventory losses  million in lifo charges and million related to trade receivables 
distribution expenses increased  as a percentage of sales  due to higher costs of operating our warehouses and increased outside warehouse space added during the year 
plans are in place to consolidate us west coast warehousing into a leased facility  to be built late in fiscal additionally we incurred a full year of expenses in fiscal related to the operation of salton europe 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in freight costs from changing certain customers from prepaid freight to collect freight during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include a full year of salton europe or million compared to one month of salton europe or million in fiscal expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses were of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million in fiscal this increase was primarily from increased spending on cooperative advertising  direct advertising  royalty expenses and trade show expenses  partially offset by decreased spending on infomercial advertising 
these expenditures were driven primarily to penetrate new brands into the european market  and to increase sales in a promotionally driven domestic market 
the remaining selling  general and administrative costs increased to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal this was primarily attributable to increased salaries  amortization on goodwill and other intangibles  increased legal and other professional expenses related to legal matters and a domestic corporate restructuring for improved reporting purposes  rent  travel  product development costs to support our sales activities  and increases in certain other administrative expenses to support the activities of the company 
the increases in salaries  product development and other administrative expense were primarily related to the integration of new or acquired product lines and businesses  and infrastructure and systems improvements 
these expenses are primarily anticipated to benefit future periods 
legal settlements  net 
we recorded a million expense for three legal settlements 
the settlement with applica  the settlement with advantage partners and the settlement with the attorney generals were all recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fair market value adjustment on derivatives 
salton europe entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily us dollar inventory purchases 
the contracts generally mature within one year and are designed to limit exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
we recognized a pre tax charge for a decrease in the fair market value of the derivatives of million  or million net of tax  from foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with us gaap 
unrealized pre tax losses of million or million net of tax  from foreign exchange contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges were included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair market value adjustment occurred primarily in the fourth quarter as the dollar weakened against the pound sterling 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to interest expense of million related to the million senior subordinated debt offering completed in april   interest expense of related to the accretion of the pifco loan notes and a reduction in interest income of million for funds kept on deposit during fiscal  partially offset by a reduction of interest paid of million on reduced borrowings under our revolver and term debt and lower rates during fiscal our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordinated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal these increases contributed to higher interest expense and the increased borrowings were used to provide working capital necessary to support the business and make acquisitions 
income tax expense 
salton had tax expense of million in fiscal as compared to tax expense of million in fiscal the overall tax rate for fiscal was of pretax income compared to in fiscal this reduction was primarily due to certain initiatives implemented in fiscal that reduced our state taxes and by the impact of certain legal settlements  which were not taxable 
we expect the tax rate to be approximately in the future 
net income 
net income decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal earnings per share 
basic earnings per common share were per share on weighted average common shares outstanding of  in fiscal compared to earnings of per share on weighted average common shares outstanding of  in fiscal diluted earnings per common share were per share on weighted average common shares outstanding  including dilutive common stock equivalents  of  in fiscal compared to earnings of per share on weighted average common shares outstanding  including dilutive common stock equivalents  of  in fiscal the reduction in share counts at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal is primarily due to the repurchase of  shares related to the george foreman guarantee and a decrease in the number of shares related to employee stock options  primarily from the dilutive effect of the current price of our common stock 
all share counts reflect a for split of our common stock effective july   for stockholders of record at the close of business on july  year ended june  compared to year ended july  net sales 
net sales in the fifty two weeks ended june  fiscal were million  a decrease of approximately million or  compared to net sales of million in the fifty three weeks ended july  fiscal 
this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales of products under the white westinghouse r product line  primarily sold to kmart  and reduced sales of products under the rejuvenique r brand  which was subject to a warning letter from the fda during the period 
we were additionally impacted by reduced sales of products under the brands of juiceman r  farberware r  breadman r  magic chef r and ingraham r 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by an increase in sales of products under the melitta r brand  toastmaster r brand  the george foreman tm brand and the kenmore r brand 
sales of new product lines  primarily under the relaxor r  ultrasonex tm  aircore r  welbilt r and stiffel r brands and the addition of one month s results of newly acquired pifco holdings plc  also helped offset the sales decreases 
net sales of the white westinghouse r brand to kmart approximated of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal cost of goods sold during fiscal increased to of net sales compared to in fiscal gross profit decreased primarily from a reduction in sales of higher priced items with higher gross margins  particularly large and extra large size george foreman tm indoor grills  rejuvenique r  juiceman r and juicelady r brand products 
we also had increased sales of products with lower gross margins  primarily toastmaster r brand products 
distribution expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal distribution expenses increased  as a percentage of sales  due to higher costs for shipping to customers  primarily due to higher fuel costs and an increase in sales to customers purchasing on prepaid freight terms that ordered in smaller quantities on a more frequent basis  thereby increasing our freight costs 
additionally we incurred a full year of expenses in fiscal related to the addition of two warehouses during fiscal and two former manufacturing facilities were converted to distribution centers and are now carried in distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million for fiscal expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses were of net sales or million in fiscal compared to of net sales or million in fiscal this reduction was primarily from less spending on infomercials  as well as lower royalties on white westinghouse r products  partially offset by increased spending on cooperative and direct advertising 
the remaining selling  general and administrative costs increased to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal this was primarily attributable to increased salaries  rent  travel and product development costs to support our sales activities  increased legal expenses and settlement costs  primarily related to rejuvenique r and the fda  patent infringement claims and other corporate activities and increases in certain other administrative expenses to support the activities of the company 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing  operating income decreased by million or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest expense 
net interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to interest paid of million on increased borrowings under our revolver and term debt  interest of million related to the million senior subordinated debt offering completed in april  and a reduction in interest income of million for funds kept on deposit during fiscal our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordinated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal these increases contributed to higher interest expense and the increased borrowings were used to make acquisitions and provide working capital necessary to support the business 
income tax expense 
salton had tax expense of million in fiscal as compared to tax expense of million in fiscal net income

liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we provided net cash of million in operating activities and used net cash of million in investing activities 
the cash provided from operating activities resulted primarily from net income  non cash expenses for depreciation  amortization and imputed interest on notes that carry lower than market interest charges  an increase in accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid income taxes 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  an increase in inventories  and a reduction in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily from strong sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a continued reduction of sales of white westinghouse r brand products  generally sold to k mart on day sales terms which were replaced by sales made to customers on generally day to day normal sales terms 
kmart filed for bankruptcy protection in fiscal the increase in inventories was primarily from an increase in salton europe to better service our customers and to support the large sales growth there  an increase in us based inventories as retailers require us to hold more inventory to satisfy their order patterns and an increase in inventory due to the threat of a longshoreman s strike in california where over of our inventories are received 
income tax payments were lower as estimated payments made in the prior year were recovered in the current year  as well as lower taxes payable on lower income in the current year and the reduction in the overall tax rate 
cash used in investing activities included additions to intangibles  patents and trademarks  capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses 
the additions to intangibles  patents and trademarks included the additional payment on the george foreman transaction related to the repurchase of our common stock  the purchase of the westclox r  big ben r and spartus r brand names and the purchase of manufacturing  distribution and intellectual property rights of certain food grilling products 
capital expenditures are primarily for tooling for new products  leasehold improvements and furniture  fixtures  office equipment  computer hardware and software to operate the business 
financing activities provided net cash of million 
at june   we had debt outstanding of million  including million of senior subordinated notes due  excluding million related to the fair value of a monetized fixed to floating interest rate swap on the notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement exclusive of unused commitments of up to million under the revolving credit facility  million related to the term note outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement  million related to amounts still due under the george foreman agreement and excluding million related to the loan notes issued in the pifco holdings plc acquisition 
the loan notes are cash collateralized at a bank in the united kingdom 
at june   we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million under our revolving credit facility 
typically  given the seasonal nature of our business  our borrowings tend to be the highest in mid fall and early winter 
in the quarter ended december   we acquired  effective july   the right to use in perpetuity and worldwide the name george foreman tm in connection with the marketing and sale of food preparation and non alcoholic drink preparation and serving appliances 
the aggregate purchase price payable to george foreman and other venture participants was million  of which million was paid in cash and the remainder was paid through the issuance by us of  shares of our common stock and a million non interest bearing subordinated promissory note 
we paid the first installment in cash to george foreman during fiscal  as well as issued stock to the other venture participants as described in the following paragraph 
the note  as of june   has a face amount of million  and is recorded at its present value of million 
the effect of the george foreman transaction was an elimination of substantial royalty expense 
on september  we announced that we had reached an agreement to satisfy payment obligations of million under the note by issuing  shares of our common stock to george foreman and other venture participants 
we agreed  under certain circumstances  to guarantee the value of these shares 
we registered for resale the shares of common stock issued to george foreman and the other venture participants 
on july   we took back  of the  shares issued to george foreman on september  and paid him million 
this payment  which represented million less the proceeds george foreman received from the sale of shares on the open market previously issued to him  terminated our guarantee obligation with respect to the shares issued to him and satisfied the third annual installment due under the note payable to george foreman 
upon completion of this transaction we had only two installments remaining under the note  as well as our outstanding guarantee obligation to the other venture participants 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we paid one of the two remaining installments under the note 
during the fiscal quarter ended december   we amended and restated our credit agreement among us  lehman brothers inc  as arranger  lehman commercial paper inc  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of banks 
we increased our existing revolving credit facility from million to million 
the amended and restated credit agreement provided for million in a senior secured credit facility consisting of a million term loan at an established base rate equivalent to the prime rate of interest plus an applicable margin of basis points or  at our election  a eurodollar rate equivalent to the libor rate plus an applicable margin of basis points maturing in twenty four consecutive quarterly installments commencing on march   and a million revolving credit facility at an established base rate equivalent to the prime rate of interest plus an applicable margin or  at our election  a eurodollar rate equivalent to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based on a range of ratios of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization maturing on january  the amended and restated credit agreement is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets 
credit availability is based on a formula related to trade accounts receivable  inventories and outstanding letters of credit 
during the fiscal quarter ended september   we further amended and restated our credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement increased the senior secured credit facilities to an aggregate of million  consisting of a million term loan amortizing over sixteen consecutive quarterly installments commencing on march  and a million revolving credit facility maturing on january  the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at an established base rate equivalent to the prime rate of interest or  at our election  a eurodollar rate equivalent to the libor rate  plus in either case an applicable margin based on total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
under our settlement agreement with the attorney generals of new york and illinois we are required to make a payment of million upon final approval of the agreement and two additional payments of million each on march  and  respectively 
in fiscal we had issued a promissory note to applica  inc in the face amount of million 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with applica 
as a result  we cancelled the promissory note  having a carrying value prior to the settlement of approximately million and an accounts payable balance of million 
we agreed to pay to applica an amount of million on or before december  and million on or before june  this settles all claims with applica  including future amounts that would have been due under the earlier arrangement to pay applica a fee based upon our net sales of white westinghouse r products to kmart 
our principal uses of liquidity will be to meet debt service requirements  pay royalties and other fees under our license and other agreements  finance our capital expenditures and possible acquisitions and fund working capital 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service  royalty payments  capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and working capital will be funded by internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million and million for fiscal years and we incurred approximately million for capital expenditures during fiscal our senior credit facilities contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock  enter into certain investments  enter into sale and lease back transactions  make certain acquisitions  engage in mergers and consolidations  create liens  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and otherwise restrict our corporate and business activities 
in addition  under the senior credit facilities  we are required to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including a minimum net worth test  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due and senior subordinated notes due contains  covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  create certain liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and lease back transactions  sell assets or enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest or liquidated damages  if any  on  or to refinance  indebtedness including the notes  to pay royalties and other fees under our license and other agreements or to fund planned capital expenditures and or possible acquisitions  will depend upon our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that future cash flow from operations  together with available borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  and other sources of debt funding  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for capital expenditures  potential acquisitions  royalty payments  working capital  interest payments and scheduled principal payments 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  including the notes  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be available or that any sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
as of june   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we have historically experienced higher sales during the months of august through november primarily due to increased demand by customers for our products attributable to holiday sales 
this seasonality has also resulted in additional interest expense to us during this period due to an increased need to borrow funds to maintain sufficient working capital to finance product purchases and customer receivables for the seasonal period 
effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we generally negotiate our purchase orders with our foreign manufacturers in united states dollars

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs through the use of interest rate swaps 
our objectives in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt  and hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments and receipts by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts 
the following tables provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major risk exposures are changing interest rates in the united states and foreign currency commitments in europe

in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate naturally occurring offsetting positions and then hedges residual balance sheet exposures 
at june   we had forward contracts outstanding for the sale of million gbp and the purchase of million over the course of the next twelve months  which had an aggregate fair value of million
