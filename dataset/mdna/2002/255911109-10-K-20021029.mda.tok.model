critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  which involve significant judgments and estimates  are used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
revenue from software licenses  which include a cancellation clause  is recognized upon expiration of the cancellation period 
software licensed with post contract customer support includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates and bug fixes 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
the company determines the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue related to products still in the testing phase is deferred until formal acceptance of the product by the purchaser 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the company records deferred revenue for maintenance amounts invoiced prior to revenue recognition 
revenue derived from the development and installation of software packages under a fixed price contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
when estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
revenue related to professional services  such as implementation  training and consulting  is generally recognized as the services are performed 
revenue and incremental direct costs related to professional services implementation associated with the company s asp hosting operations is deferred during the implementation phase and subsequently recognized over the term of the asp hosting agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the specific details of the customer accounts  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  or with statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the guidance above requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirement associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in future net cash flows or fair value could result in the inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby requiring an impairment charge to be recognized 
deferred taxes and valuation allowance the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
translation of foreign currency the company translates the financial statements of its european subsidiary into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation
