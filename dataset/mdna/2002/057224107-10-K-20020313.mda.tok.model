see business environment for a more detailed discussion of certain of these factors 
baker hughes expectations regarding its level of capital expenditures described in liquidity and capital resources below are only its forecasts regarding these matters 
in addition to the factors described in the previous paragraph and in business environment  these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which are affected by the following factors the accuracy of the company s estimates regarding its spending requirements  regulatory  legal and contractual impediments to spending reduction measures  the occurrence of any unanticipated acquisition or research and development opportunities  changes in the company s strategic direction  the need to replace any unanticipated losses in capital assets and the factors listed in item business environmental matters 
business environment the company has eight operating divisions each with separate management teams and infrastructure that offer different products and services 
the divisions have been aggregated into two reportable segments oilfield and process 
the oilfield segment consists of six operating divisions baker atlas  baker hughes inteq  baker oil tools  baker petrolite  centrilift and hughes christensen that manufacture and sell equipment and provide related services used in exploring for  developing and producing hydrocarbon reserves 
the oilfield segment also includes the company s interest in an oil and gas property in nigeria and its investment in western geco 
in  revenues from the oilfield segment accounted for of total revenues 
the process segment consists of two operating divisions eimco process equipment and bird machine that manufacture and sell process equipment for separating solids from liquids and liquids from liquids through filtration  sedimentation  centrifugation and flotation processes 
the business environment for the company s oilfield segment and its corresponding operating results can be significantly affected by the level of energy industry capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by oil company expectations about the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas products and by the energy price environment that results from supply and demand imbalances 
key factors currently influencing the worldwide crude oil and gas markets are o production control the degree to which opec nations and other large producing countries  such as mexico  norway  and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of crude oil to reduce supply and support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
o global economic growth particularly the impact of the us and western european economies and economic activity in japan  china  south korea and the developing areas of asia where the correlation between energy demand and economic growth is strong 
the international energy agency forecasted in february worldwide oil demand growth of approximately  compared with the averaged for the years ending december during  the us economy went into a recession that is expected to continue into an important factor in the global economic growth in is the timing and strength of the us economic recovery 
o oil and gas storage inventories relative to historic levels 
inventory levels offer a measure of the balance between supply and demand 
north american natural gas inventories at the beginning of november the start of the winter withdrawal season were at record high levels 
continued high inventories  without an increase in demand  indicate a market that is amply supplied 
o technological progress in the design and application of new products that allow oil and gas companies to drill fewer wells and to drill  complete and produce wells faster and at lower cost 
o maturity of the resource base of known hydrocarbon reserves in the north sea  us  canada and latin america 
o pace of new investment access to capital and the reinvestment of available cash flow into existing and emerging markets 
o price volatility the impact of widely fluctuating commodity prices on the stability of the market and subsequent impact on customer spending 
o possible supply disruptions from key oil exporting countries  including  but not limited to  iraq  saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries  due to political instability or military activity 
o weather the impact of variations in temperatures as compared with normal weather patterns and the related effect on demand for oil and natural gas 
oil and gas prices generally  customers expectations about their prospects from oil and gas sales and customers expenditures to explore for or produce oil and gas rise or fall with corresponding changes in the prices of oil or gas 
accordingly  changes in these expenditures will normally result in increased or decreased demand for the company s products and services in its oilfield segment 
crude oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 
west texas intermediate crude bbl us spot natural gas mmbtu oil prices averaged bbl in  ranging from a low of bbl to a high of bbl 
slower economic growth and higher opec production levels contributed to an increase in inventories and a moderation in oil prices 
oil prices over the course of the year fell from levels above opec s self declared targeted price zone in the first half of to levels below opec s targeted price zone in the second half of the year 
in november  opec abandoned defense of its targeted price zone as it sought cooperation with certain non opec countries  particularly russia  norway and mexico  to jointly reduce production in an effort to reduce inventories and support prices 
during  natural gas prices averaged mmbtu  down from the mmbtu average price for prices ranged from a high of mmbtu in january to a low of mmbtu in november 
the decline in natural gas prices was driven by a decrease in demand for natural gas due to slowing us economic growth  offset only partially by increased demand from fuel switching back to natural gas 
a modest increase in production also contributed to the decline in prices 
at the beginning of the withdrawal season  inventories were at record high levels following record storage injections during the summer of mild weather and the us recession continued to moderate demand and allowed year over year storage surpluses to grow through the remainder of  resulting in softer prices 
rig counts the company is engaged in the oilfield service industry providing products and services that are used in exploring for  developing and producing oil and gas reservoirs 
when drilling or workover rigs are active  they consume the products and services produced by the oilfield service industry 
the rig counts act as a leading indicator of consumption of products and services used in drilling  completing  producing and processing hydrocarbons 
rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas 
rig counts therefore reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices 
the company s rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated and are based on weekly rig counts for the us and canada and monthly rig counts for all other areas 
us land  us offshore canada north america   latin america north sea other europe africa middle east asia pacific outside north america worldwide    us workover rigs   industry outlook caution is advised that the factors described above in forward looking statements and business environment could negatively impact the company s expectations for oil demand  oil and gas prices and drilling activity 
oil oil prices are expected to average between bbl and bbl in sustained oil prices in this range and an outlook that prices are likely to remain in this range are expected to support the company s forecast of customer spending 
oil prices are particularly susceptible to changes in oil supply as oil demand growth in compared with is expected to be the lowest year to year growth in a decade 
prices could fall to bbl to bbl by mid year  resulting in lower than forecasted spending  if one or more of the following occurs opec is unwilling or unable to control its production  russia or other major non opec producers are unwilling or unable to restrain their production  or the us economic recovery is delayed into late or prices could rise to bbl to bbl  or more  if one or more of the following occur the us and worldwide economic recovery occurs sooner or is stronger than forecasted  opec or key non opec oil exporting countries  particularly russia  constrain oil production  or a supply disruption occurs  resulting from political or military action in a key oil exporting region 
north america natural gas us natural gas prices are expected to average between mmbtu and mmbtu in prices are expected to average between mmbtu and mmbtu in the first half of as year over year inventory surpluses and weak demand continue to influence prices 
as a result of lower natural gas prices during this period  spending by the company s customers directed at developing natural gas supplies and therefore  drilling activity is expected to remain soft 
in the second half of the year  the impact of a growing us economy and production declines resulting from lower spending in the second half of and the first half of are expected to result in a tighter supply demand balance in the market 
as a result  prices could exceed mmbtu by year end 
prices could trade lower if weather is milder than normal  if the economic recovery is delayed  or if production levels are maintained despite lower drilling activity 
prices could trade higher if weather is more extreme than normal  if the economic recovery occurs sooner or is stronger than expected  or if production levels fall more than expected as a result of lower drilling activity 
customer spending based upon the company s discussions with its major customers and its review of published industry surveys and reports and the company s outlook for oil and gas prices described above  the anticipated customer spending trends are as follows o north america spending in north america  primarily towards developing natural gas supplies  is expected to be down to in compared with o outside north america customer spending  primarily directed at developing oil supplies  is expected to be flat to up in compared with o total spending is expected to be down to in compared with drilling activity based upon the company s outlooks for oil and natural gas prices and customer spending described above  the company s outlook for drilling activity  as measured by the baker hughes rig count  is as follows o the north american rig count is expected to decline between to in compared with o drilling activity outside of north america is expected to increase to in compared with company outlook the trends as described above relating to declining rig counts  decreased customer spending and low oil and gas prices began in late and have continued to develop in as a result  the company expects that will not be as strong as  with revenues expected to decline by approximately to as compared with  with related declines in operating results 
recent changes in currency laws and other economic events in argentina are expected to negatively impact the company 
changes mandated by law may prevent the company from being able to fully recover outstanding receivables from its customers and losses are expected as a result of the devaluation of the argentine peso 
in addition  the uncertain economic environment in argentina will likely negatively impact the exploration and production spending plans of the company s customers in argentina in and beyond  thus reducing the demand for the company s products 
the company is responding to this situation in a number of ways  including negotiating with its customers for acceptable payment terms on outstanding receivables  increasing the use of us dollar based invoicing or us dollar equivalent pricing and invoicing  adjusting pricing and contracts to reflect the changes in argentina s currency  and shipping products to argentina directly from outside the country with payment made offshore in us dollar or equivalent currency 
although the company has provided for its best estimate of uncollectible receivables at december   it is uncertain at this time as to the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact on the company  however  the company estimates potential losses related to the devaluation and uncollectible receivables could be between million and million 
in  revenues from argentina were less than of the company s total revenue  accordingly  the impact on the company s total revenues in is not expected to be significant 
historically  the venezuelan economy has experienced high inflation and a weakening currency 
recently  venezuela has experienced additional political and economic uncertainties  including large fluctuations in exchange rates with the us dollar 
this creates additional uncertainties for the business environment and market for the company s products and services 
the company continues to closely monitor the economic situation in venezuela and is taking appropriate actions to minimize its exposure to these risks 
critical accounting policies the company has defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires the management of the company to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting polices used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of collectibility  which requires the company to use estimates and exercise judgment 
the company routinely monitors its customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured 
this requires the company to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowances needed for doubtful accounts 
the company records provisions for doubtful accounts when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to make the required payments either at contractual due dates or in the future 
adverse changes in the financial condition of the company s customers could require additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventory the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand  market conditions  production requirements and technological developments 
significant or unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company uses the liability method for reporting income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to realize its deferred tax assets 
the company operates under many legal forms and in more than countries 
as a result  the company is subject to many domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and to many tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that the company provides during any given year 
western geco on november   the company and schlumberger and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of schlumberger created a venture by transferring the seismic fleets  data processing assets  exclusive and nonexclusive multiclient surveys and other assets of the company s western geophysical division and schlumberger s geco prakla business unit

for its fiscal year beginning january  euro conversion a single european currency the euro was introduced on january   at which time the conversion rates between the old  or legacy  currencies and the euro were set for participating member countries 
the legacy currencies in those countries were used as legal tender through december  and will be used for a short transition period subsequent to december  thereafter  the legacy currencies will be canceled  and euro bills and coins will be used in the participating countries 
prior to december   the company converted its legacy currency based financial records to the euro 
in addition  the company reviewed existing contracts and agreements with customers and vendors to assess the potential impact of converting to the euro 
the company did not experience any problems or issues in converting its financial records and systems to the euro that  in the opinion of management  materially or adversely affected the consolidated financial condition of the company 
in addition  due to the nature of the company s business as it relates to customers and vendors  it does not expect any significant problems related to the euro to arise subsequent to december  that could materially or adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
the word expect is intended to identify a forward looking statement in euro conversion 
the company s anticipation regarding the lack of significance of the euro introduction on the company s operations is only its forecast regarding this matter 
this forecast may be substantially different from actual results  which are affected by factors such as the following the failure of the company to implement sap r or another euro compliant computer system or unforeseen difficulties in updating computer systems to accommodate the euro in any new geographic location that prices in euros or in any newly acquired entity  the inability of third parties to adequately address their own euro systems issues  including vendors  contractors  financial institutions  us and foreign governments and customers  and the lack of alternatives available to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments that arise in the normal course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
commercial paper borrowings  other short term borrowings and variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is managed by borrowing money that has a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt aggregating  million and variable rate debt aggregating million 
the following table sets forth  as of december  and  the company s principal cash flows for its long term debt obligations  which bear a fixed rate of interest and are denominated in us dollars  and the related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the table sets forth the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates of the company s interest rate swaps by expected maturity dollar amounts in millions 
thereafter total as of december  long term debt   weighted average interest rates fixed to variable swaps notional amount pay rate receive rate as of december  long term debt   weighted average interest rates fixed to variable swaps notional amount pay rate receive rate fair market value of long term debt is  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
fair market value of the interest rate swaps is a million asset and a million liability at december  and  respectively 
includes the liquid yield options notes lyons with an accreted value of million at december  the lyons were redeemed for cash in may average six month libor for the japanese yen  the euro and the swiss franc plus 
three month libor plus 
investments during  the company sold its investment in common stock and common stock warrants of varco at an average price of per share 
total proceeds from the sale of the company s investment in the common stock and the warrants were million 
crude oil contracts during the year ended december   the company entered into two crude oil contracts to mitigate price risk associated with production from the company s interest in an oil producing property in nigeria 
based on the company s outlook for crude oil prices  the company elected to terminate these contracts prior to their maturity dates 
accordingly  the contracts were terminated on october   and the company received a cash payment of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the net gain recognized in earnings in from all crude oil contracts was million and is reported in revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   the company had entered into two contracts to mitigate price risk associated with the company s interest in an oil producing property in nigeria 
the fair value of these contracts at december  was a million unrecorded asset 
foreign currency and foreign currency forward contracts the company s operations are conducted around the world in a number of different currencies 
the majority of the company s foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency 
as such  future earnings are subject to change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currencies 
to minimize the need for foreign currency contracts  the company is generally able to manage its foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than the functional currency 
at december   the company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of million  million and million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar  the indonesian rupiah and the euro  respectively 
these contracts are cash flow hedges 
based on year end quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  no asset or liability was recorded as the forward price is substantially the same as the contract price 
at december   the company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of million  million and million to hedge against exposure to fluctuations in the british pound  the south african rand and the euro  respectively 
the fair market value of these forward contracts was a million unrecorded asset 
the counterparties to the company s forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  the company s exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
certain borrowings of the company are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
at december   these nonfunctional currency borrowings totaled million with exposures between the us dollar and the euro  the saudi riyal  the brazilian real  the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit 
a depreciation of the us dollar against these currencies would not have a material adverse effect on the future earnings of the company
