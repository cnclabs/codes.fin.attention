in fulfilling its responsibility for the reliability of financial information  management has developed and maintains accounting systems and procedures appropriately supported by internal accounting controls 
such controls include the selection and training of qualified personnel  an organizational structure providing for appropriate division of responsibility  communication of approved accounting  control and business practices  and a program of internal audit 
although no system of internal accounting controls can ensure that all errors or irregularities have been eliminated  management believes that the controls in place provide reasonable assurance  at reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition  that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization  and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements of the company have been audited by deloitte touche llp  the company s independent auditors

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 
inventory valuation 
the company s inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
the company computes the weighted average cost utilizing specific identification at the stock keeping unit level multiplied by the weighted average cost for such stock keeping unit 
in most cases  the expected sales value ie  market value of the company s inventory is higher than its cost 
however  as the company progresses through a selling season  certain merchandise may be currently  or in the future  marked to sell or ultimately sold below the cost for that item 
as a result  there is a high degree of judgement and complexity in determining the market value of such inventories 
for inventories on hand at any given fiscal quarter end  the company estimates the future selling price of its merchandise  given its current selling price and its planned promotional activities  and provides a reserve for the difference between cost and the expected selling price for all items expected to be sold below cost 
the company conducts a chainwide physical inventory count near the end of each fiscal year and adjusts the company s records to reflect the actual inventory counts 
for interim financial reporting quarters  the company provides a reserve for shrinkage based principally on historical shrinkage experience 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates its investment in long lived assets used in operations at the individual store level that is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
when evaluating assets for potential impairment  the company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
the individual store s estimated future cash flows are based on the company s estimated future results given perceived local market conditions  the local economy and historical results 
if the individual store s estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset  impairment is indicated 
decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
the impairment loss would then be recorded and is generally measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s estimated fair value generally based upon future discounted cash flows 
in addition  decisions to close a store  prior to the expiration of its underlying lease  generally results in increased depreciation over the remaining revised useful life of property and equipment 
insurance 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and general liability up to a predetermined stop loss amount 
third party insurance coverage is maintained for claims that exceed the predetermined stop loss amount 
the company s self insurance accruals are based upon standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions or the company s historical claims experience 
income taxes 
the company records reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of financial results
