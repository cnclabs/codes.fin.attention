the income earned on this activity is pawn service charge revenue 
while allowable service charges vary by state and by amount of the loan  a majority of the company s pawn loans are in amounts that permit pawn service charges of per month or per annum 
the company s average pawn loan amount has historically averaged between and the allowable term of pawn loans also differs by state  but is typically days with an automatic day extension 
a secondary  but related  activity of the company is the sale of merchandise 
the company acquires inventory for its retail sales primarily through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases from customers and wholesale distributors 
the realization of gross profit on sales of inventory primarily depends on the company s initial assessment of the property s resale value 
improper assessment of the resale value of the collateral in the lending function can result in reduced marketability of the property and the realization of a lower margin 
the company also offers unsecured payroll advances in most of its pawnshops 
in a limited number of locations  the company makes payroll advances 
in most locations  the company markets and services payroll advances made by county bank  a federally insured delaware bank 
after origination of the loans  the company may purchase an participation in the loans made by county bank and marketed by the company 
the average payroll advance amount is just over and the terms are generally less than days  averaging about days 
the service charge per loaned is typically per day period  but varies in certain locations 
in fiscal  the company adopted a restructuring plan  including the closure of several under performing stores 
the restructuring plan and its effects are described more fully below 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for losses on payroll advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  observable trends  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management uses this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition pawn service charges are recorded using the interest method for all pawn loans the company deems to be collectible 
the company bases its estimate of uncollectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates  and the amount of loans due in the following three months 
if future redemption rates  loan extensions  or other factors vary from historical trends used in the company s estimate  the company s earnings and financial condition would be affected 
in fiscal  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million resulted from an increase in accrued pawn service charges receivable 
payroll advances and related service charges reported in the company s consolidated financial statements reflect only the company s participation interest in these loans 
the company accrues service charges on the loans the company deems to be collectible 
accrued service charges related to defaulted loans are deducted from service charge revenue upon loan default  and increase service charge revenue upon subsequent collection 
allowance for losses on payroll advances unlike pawn loans  payroll advances are unsecured  and their profitability is highly dependent upon the company s ability to manage the default rate and collect defaulted loans 
the company considers a loan defaulted if the loan has not been repaid or refinanced by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected subsequently  the company charges defaulted loans principal to bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
subsequent collections of principal are recorded as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
the company also provides an allowance for losses on active payroll advances and related service charges receivable 
this estimate is based largely on recent net default rates and expected seasonal fluctuations in default rates 
the accuracy of the company s allowance estimate is dependent upon several factors  including its ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
changes in the principal valuation allowance are charged to bad debt expense 
changes in the service charge receivable valuation allowance are charged to service charge revenue 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
the company believes it effectively manages these risks by using a credit scoring system  closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio  and participating in loans made by a bank using similar strategies 
inventory if a pawn loan is not repaid  the forfeited collateral inventory is recorded at cost pawn loan principal 
accordingly  the company does not record loan loss reserves or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost or market net realizable value  the company provides a reserve for shrinkage and excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory 
the company s inventory reserve is based on the type and age of merchandise as well as recent sales trends and margins 
at september   this reserve was approximately million  or of the gross inventory balance 
changes in the inventory reserve are recorded as cost of goods sold 
the company s inventory reserve is dependent on its ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold prices or new product offerings could increase or decrease the company s inventory reserves 
in addition to its ordinary inventory reserve  the company reserved another million of its inventory at september  as part of its restructuring plan 
this reserve wrote down to estimated realizable value the inventory at stores targeted for closure 
this additional reserve was fully utilized in fiscal as the related inventory was sold 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
no impairment was recognized in fiscal   or  other than as part of the company s restructuring in fiscal the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  october  the company will cease to amortize goodwill and pawn licenses in its fiscal year ending september  this will lower amortization expense in fiscal by  the company also currently amortizes goodwill related to its equity investment in a b 
this  annual amortization  recorded as a reduction to equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate  also will cease in fiscal the company will perform an annual impairment test  and expects to complete its first test by march  management has not yet determined the impact  if any  that this impairment test will have upon its recorded balances of goodwill or pawn licenses 
there can be no assurance that at the time the test is completed an impairment charge will not be recorded 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
an expense must be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase in the valuation allowance for a given period 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company recorded a valuation allowance of million at september   due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was based on management s estimate of taxable income in the three years following fiscal  including the expected taxable gains on the sale of properties 
the valuation allowance was not adjusted in fiscal or because management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
projected levels of pre tax earnings over the next three years  primarily attributable to ordinary and recurring operating results  are sufficient to generate the million required amount of taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company intends to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for additional valuation allowance  if any 
uncertainties that might impact the realization of the deferred tax assets include possible declines in sales  margins and revenues 
in the event that the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a decrease to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
disclosure and internal controls based on an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures  accounting policies  and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and procedures  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company in all material respects 
there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation 
management identified no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls 
other risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report as well as changes in business strategies  could adversely impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows in future periods 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company s fiscal pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from fiscal to million 
this represents an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million offset by the decrease in pawn service charge revenue from closed stores million 
of the million improvement in same store pawn service charge revenue  million was due to greater average loan balances during the year and million was due to a percentage point improvement in loan yields to in fiscal variations in the annualized loan yield  as seen between these periods  are due generally to changes in the level of loan forfeitures and a mix shift between loans with different yields 
excluding the effect of closed stores  the company s fiscal average balance of pawn loans outstanding was higher and ending pawn loans outstanding were higher than in fiscal fiscal sales increased million from fiscal to million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in jewelry scrapping sales million  offset by a reduction in sales from closed stores million and lower same store merchandise sales million 
lower merchandise sales occurred mainly in jewelry largely as a result of lower jewelry inventories caused by the higher level of jewelry scrapping 
below is a summary of fiscal and sales and margins fiscal year ended september  dollars in millions merchandise sales jewelry scrapping sales other revenues total sales gross profit on merchandise sales gross profit loss on jewelry scrapping sales gross margin on merchandise sales gross margin on jewelry scrapping sales overall gross margin fiscal overall gross margins on sales decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
margins on merchandise sales  excluding jewelry scrapping  decreased percentage points as a result of higher loan values on forfeited collateral  more aggressive discounting  and higher inventory reserves  primarily on aging general merchandise 
the change in merchandise sales margins comprised of a percentage point of the change in overall gross margins 
although margins on jewelry scrapping improved in fiscal due largely to higher gold prices  the increase in volume of these low margin sales jewelry generally is scrapped at a loss or small margin had a percentage point negative effect on overall margins 
inventory shrinkage  included in cost of goods sold  was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal payroll advance data are as follows for fiscal and fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands service charge revenue   bad debt included in operating expense   other direct expenses included in operating expense collection costs included in administrative expense contribution to operating income  average payroll advance balance outstanding during year  payroll advance loan balance at end of year   average loan balance per participating location at end of year participating locations at end of year whole numbers net default rate defaults net of collections  measured as a percent of loans made the contribution to operating income presented above is the incremental contribution only and excludes other costs such as labor  rent  and other overhead costs 
payroll advance service charge revenue and bad debt expense each increased from fiscal primarily due to higher average loan balances 
the loan balance increased due to the maturing of the product and a growth in the number of locations offering the loans 
the company provides for a valuation allowance on both the principal and fees receivable for payroll advances 
due to the short term nature of these loans  the company uses recent net default rates and anticipated seasonal changes in the rate as the basis for its valuation allowance  rather than reserving the annual rate 
at september   the valuation allowance was of the payroll advance principal and fees receivable 
in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased of a percentage point to 
fiscal operating expenses reflect a volume related million increase in payroll advance bad debt and other direct expenses  and a million increase in rent from the sale leaseback of previously owned store locations 
despite these increases  store operating expenses decreased as a percent of net revenues due to the effects of greater net revenues and an improvement in other store operating expenses 
the incremental sale leaseback rent was largely offset by related decreases in depreciation of the sold locations and lower interest expense from debt retired with the proceeds from the sale leasebacks 
administrative expenses measured as a percentage of net revenues increased of a percentage point from fiscal to 
the increase is due primarily to higher employment related costs and payroll advance collection costs 
employment cost increases reflect limited staff additions  general inflation  and greater incentive compensation related to the company s improved overall performance in fiscal the increased volume of payroll advances in fiscal required the increase in payroll advance collection costs  primarily labor 
depreciation and amortization expense  when measured as a percentage of net revenue  decreased percentage points in fiscal to 
this improvement is primarily due to the reduction in depreciable assets through the sale leaseback of previously owned locations 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased by million to million 
lower average debt balances led to million of the improvement  while lower effective interest rates contributed the remaining million 
at september   the company s total debt was million compared to million at september  decreases in the debt balance were funded primarily by cash flow from operations and million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of previously owned locations 
the fiscal income tax provision was million of pretax income compared to an income tax benefit of million of pretax loss for fiscal the increase in effective tax rate for fiscal compared to the fiscal benefit is due to non tax deductible items having a smaller percentage effect on larger pre tax earnings 
operating income for fiscal increased million over fiscal to million 
the million greater contribution from payroll advances and million increase in same store pawn service charges account for most of the overall improvement 
these improvements were largely offset by lower gross profits on sales million and increased rent from the sale leaseback of store locations million  combined with higher administrative costs 
after a million decrease in interest expense and smaller changes in other non operating items  fiscal net income improved to million from fiscal s million net loss 
fiscal compared to fiscal while the company s average store count during fiscal was down from fiscal due to the restructuring  its pawn service charge revenue decreased only  or million from fiscal to million 
this represents an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million offset by the decrease in pawn service charge revenue from the forty seven closed stores million 
greater average loan balances during the year contributed million of the increase in same store pawn service charges  while lower pawn loan yields offset this amount by million 
pawn loan yields were in fiscal compared to in fiscal variations in the annualized loan yield  as seen between these periods  are due generally to changes in the level of loan forfeitures and a mix shift between loans with different yields 
at september   same store pawn loan balances were above september  fiscal merchandise sales decreased approximately million from fiscal to million primarily due to a reduction in sales from closed stores million 
also contributing to the change were increases in wholesale jewelry sales million  offset by a decrease in same store merchandise sales million or 
below is a summary of fiscal and sales and margins fiscal year ended september  dollars in millions merchandise sales jewelry scrapping sales other revenues total sales gross profit on merchandise sales gross profit loss on jewelry scrapping sales gross margin on merchandise sales gross margin on jewelry scrapping sales overall gross margin fiscal overall gross margins on sales improved percentage points from fiscal to 
margins on merchandise sales  excluding jewelry scrapping  improved percentage points  partially due to the absence of a restructuring charge to cost of goods as was seen in fiscal percentage points 
this improvement in merchandise sales margins comprised percentage points of the improvement in overall gross margins 
the increase in jewelry scrapping jewelry generally is scrapped at a loss or small margin reduced the overall gross margin improvement by percentage points 
inventory shrinkage was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal at the end of fiscal  the company offered payroll advances in of its pawnshops 
in five locations  the company made the loans 
in locations  the company marketed payroll advances made by county bank 
payroll advance service charge revenue increased million from fiscal to million as a result of offering the loans in additional locations 
the company offered payroll advances in only nine locations in fiscal  the results of which were immaterial 
during fiscal  the company experienced a net default rate of 
the company s bad debt expense  included in store operating expense  was million 
the company provides for a valuation allowance on both the principal and fees receivable  based on recent net default rates 
at september   the valuation allowance was of the payroll advance loan principal and fees receivable 
this reserve differed from the annual net default rate as it reflects more recent net default rates and trends 
in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased percentage points to 
administrative expenses decreased percentage points from fiscal to of net revenues 
this expense level improvement was largely due to improved cost management and the closure of lower volume stores 
on a per average store basis  operating expenses in fiscal were up slightly to  from  in fiscal administrative expenses per average store decreased during fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense  when measured as a percent of net revenue  increased of a percentage point in fiscal to  primarily due to beginning depreciation of the company s new point of sale computer system placed in service in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  interest expense increased million to million 
higher effective interest rates increased interest expense million  while lower average debt balances offset the increase by million 
at september   the company s total long term debt was million compared to million at september  the income tax benefit for fiscal was million of pretax loss compared to an income tax benefit of million of pretax loss for fiscal a valuation allowance of million was established during the year ended september   to offset certain deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets 
exclusive of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the fiscal income tax benefit was million of pretax loss 
the decrease in effective tax rate for fiscal compared to the fiscal benefit before valuation allowance is due to non tax deductible items having a greater percentage effect on a smaller pre tax loss 
excluding restructuring charges  operating income for fiscal increased million over fiscal to million 
same store net revenue growth million  expense management million and the closure of under performing stores million account for the earnings improvement  offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization million 
including the effect of the fiscal restructuring charge  operating income loss improved million  to million in fiscal after an increase in interest expense and other non operating items  the fiscal net loss improved to million from fiscal s million net loss before the million cumulative effect of the accounting change adopted in fiscal accounting change during the second quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of revenue recognition on pawn loans by reducing the accrual of pawn service charge revenues to the estimated amount that will be realized through loan collection  and recording forfeited collateral at the lower of the principal balance of the loan or estimated market value 
previously  pawn service charges were accrued on all loans  and the carrying value of the forfeited collateral was the lower of cost principal amount of loan plus accrued pawn service charges or market 
the company believes the new method of revenue recognition is preferable in that it better aligns reported net revenues and earnings with current economic trends in its business and the management of the company 
in addition  the company believes the new method improves comparability of its operating results and financial position with similar companies 
this change was made effective october   the first day of the company s fiscal year 
the million cumulative effect of this accounting change on prior years net of a tax benefit of million increased net loss for the year ended september  of the net loss per share for the year ended september   per share is attributable to the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
restructuring pursuant to a restructuring plan  the company decided to close stores and recorded a pretax charge of million million net of tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal the total pretax charge included million resulting from closed stores and approximately million related to severance of administrative staff and other restructuring costs 
the million pretax charge included a million write down of inventory included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of operations 
in june  the company re evaluated seven remaining stores that had not been closed  and decided to continue their operation  based on their improved operating performance and future outlook 
accordingly  the company reversed the million restructure accrual related to these seven stores  net of million related to stores previously closed 
the results of operations from the closed stores were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended september  total revenues  operating loss  at september   the company had a remaining restructuring reserve of liquidity and capital resources the company s million fiscal cash flow from operations consisted of million of earnings before depreciation  amortization  and other non cash items and million of changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily inventory and accounts payable 
in fiscal  the company s million cash flow from operations consisted of million of earnings before non cash items  a million income tax refund  and the collection of a million note receivable  reduced by million restructuring expenditures and million of other changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  the company invested million in property and equipment  million in pawn loan growth  and million in funding the net increase in payroll advances 
these investments and a million reduction in debt were funded by cash flow from operating activities of million  million in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily the sale leaseback of owned properties  million of dividends from its equity investment in albemarle bond holding  plc  and million of cash on hand 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and required debt payments during the coming year 
however  there can be no assurance that cash flow from operating activities will be adequate for these expenditures 
effective october   the company amended and restated its credit agreement 
the amendment extends the maturity date to march  and provides for a million revolving credit facility through march   and million thereafter 
advances under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
availability under the revolving credit facility is tied to loan and inventory balances 
interest on the revolving credit facility will be the eurodollar rate plus to basis points or the agent bank s base rate prime plus to basis points 
the company pays a commitment fee of basis points on the unused amount of the revolving facility 
terms of the agreement require  among other things  that the company meet certain financial covenants and that no dividends be paid 
the company believes that the financial covenants established in its credit facility will be achieved based upon the company s current and anticipated performance 
seasonality historically  service charge revenues are highest in the company s first fiscal quarter october through december due to improving loan redemption rates coupled with a higher average loan balance following the summer lending season 
sales generally are highest in the company s first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and the impact of tax refunds 
sales volume can be heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory  which generally occurs during low jewelry sales periods may through october 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
due primarily to significant loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season  the company s cash flow is greatest in its second fiscal quarter

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and gold prices 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s earnings and financial position may be affected by changes in gold prices and the resulting impact on pawn lending and jewelry sales 
the proceeds of scrap sales and the company s ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold prices 
the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in gold prices cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its debt  all of which is variable rate debt at september  under its amended and restated credit agreement dated october   the company s effective interest rate was reduced by approximately basis points 
if interest rates average basis points less in than they did in  the company s annual interest expense would decrease by approximately million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s variable rate debt at september  the company s earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the equity investment in albemarle bond holdings  plc a b 
a b s functional currency is the uk pound 
the uk pound exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact the company s results of operations and financial position in several ways 
for example  a devalued pound could result in an economic recession in the uk  which in turn could impact a b s and the company s results of operations and financial position 
the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the us pound cannot be reasonably estimated due to the interrelationship of operating results and exchange rates 
the translation adjustment representing the strengthening in the uk pound during the year ended june  included in the company s september  results on a three month lag as described above was approximately  on november   the uk pound closed at to us dollars  an increase strengthening from at june  no assurance can be given as to the future valuation of the uk pound and how further movements in the pound could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company
