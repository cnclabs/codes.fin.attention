item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of marine support vessels to the oil and gas industry primarily in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea  latin america and  most recently  in west africa 
we currently have a total fleet of vessels  including supply vessels  large capacity platform supply vessels  seven large anchor handling  towing and supply vessels  crew boats and nine line handling vessels 
our results of operations are affected primarily by the day rates we receive and our fleet utilization 
demand for our vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which is primarily influenced by oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of oil and gas companies 
as a result  oil and gas prices significantly affect our vessel utilization and day rates 
our day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration and capabilities of our fleet 
in the case of supply boats  psvs and ahtss  their deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors 
our day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market area with similar configurations and capabilities 
our operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of our direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and costs for the routine dry dock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain required certifications for our vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of dry dockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for dry dock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such dry dockings  typically two to five years 
results of operations the table below sets forth by vessel class  the average day rates and utilization for our vessels and the average number of vessels we owned during the periods indicated 
we sold all of our six lift boats in the second quarter of year ended december  average vessel day rates supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average vessel utilization rates supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average number of vessels supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average vessel day rate is calculated by dividing a vessel s total revenues in a period by the total number of days such vessel was under contract during such period 
average vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days for which a vessel is under contract in a period by the total number of days in such period 
set forth below is the internal allocation of our charter revenues and charter revenues less direct operating expenses among vessel classes for each of the periods indicated dollars in thousands 
year ended december  charter revenues supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats other charter revenues less direct vessel operating expenses supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats other comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december our revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to million for the increase was due primarily to improved average day rates for our supply boats in the gulf and the increase in day rates and utilization for our north sea fleet resulting from increased north sea drilling activity 
in the third quarter of  we began to experience decreased utilization and day rates for our gulf fleet due to lower oil and gas prices and decreased offshore drilling activity 
our average supply boat day rates in the gulf increased to  for  compared to  for the average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels increased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet decreased to in from in due to lower oil and gas prices and the decrease in offshore drilling activity in the gulf in the last half of utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in  due to the decrease in activity in the gulf and because two of the line handlers in brazil were off contract for part of the year 
average day rates for our north sea vessels in increased to  compared to  for vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of improved market conditions in the north sea in  we reactivated two north sea psvs in mid our last inactive north sea psv was brought back into service in the first quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses increased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for due to increases in labor costs and maintenance expenses and the re activation of a total of nine vessels from mid through direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in primarily due to the increase in average vessel day rates for our gulf supply boats and the increase in day rates and utilization for the north sea fleet 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an asset write down in the amount of million  before taxes 
this non cash charge was due to the write down of eight vessels 
six of these vessels had been deactivated or cold stacked for an extended period and have been permanently withdrawn from service 
these vessels were part of larger fleet acquisitions completed in and that had not undergone upgrade and refurbishment as we had done with the rest of our gulf supply boat fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  down from million for  due to the sale of our lift boats in the second quarter of  and the write down of the book value of eight vessels in the third quarter of amortization of marine inspection costs decreased to million for  from million for our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for principally due to increases in salaries  benefits and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased in due to the increase in average day rates for our gulf supply boats and the increase in day rates and utilization for the north sea fleet 
interest expense decreased to million during compared to million during  due to the reduction of our debt in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by our norwegian operations  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december our revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to million for the increase was due primarily to improved average day rates and utilization for our supply boat fleet in the gulf resulting from increased drilling activity 
late in the third quarter of  we began to experience increased utilization and day rates for our gulf fleet 
however  the north sea  which was slower to decline in than the gulf  did not experience any improvement until the second quarter of our average supply boat day rates in the gulf increased to  for  compared to  for the average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels increased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet increased to in from in utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in  due to the dry docking of a majority of our line handling vessels in  and the scheduled dry docking of our swath vessel in brazil 
average day rates for our north sea vessels in decreased to  compared to  for our average day rate in the north sea  as expressed in us dollars  was impacted by the norwegian kroner  which on average  depreciated by approximately against the us dollar in compared to vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of low market day rates and utilization in  we elected to deactivate two of our north sea psvs in the third quarter of a third psv was de activated in the fourth quarter of as a result of improving market conditions  we reactivated two of these three vessels late in the second quarter of we reactivated the remaining vessel in the first quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses were essentially unchanged at million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in due primarily to the increase in utilization and average vessel day rates for our gulf fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for  up from million for  due to the depreciation  for a full year  of two new vessels we placed into service in mid amortization of marine inspection costs decreased to million for  from million for our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for principally due to increases in salaries  benefits and professional fees associated with our international operations 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased in due to the increase in utilization and average day rates for our gulf fleet 
interest expense decreased to million during  compared to million during  due to the reduction of our debt in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by our norwegian operations  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
liquidity and capital resources our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service debt and acquire  maintain or improve equipment 
during  million in funds were provided by operating activities  net of million of dry docking and vessel inspection costs  a significant improvement from last year when we generated  in funds from operating activities  net of million of dry docking and vessel inspection costs 
this improvement in funds generated from operating activities is principally due to the increase in operating income  before giving effect to the million non cash asset write down  resulting from the increase in day rates for our gulf supply boats and the increase in day rates and utilization for our north sea vessels 
during  million in funds were used in financing activities  which was due to a net reduction of our debt of million 
this compares to when million in funds were provided by financing activities  which was principally due to our issuing million of common stock and million of long term debt  offset in part by the repayment of million of debt 
during  million of funds were used in investing activities  primarily due to capital expenditures of million  reduced by the proceeds from the cash sale of two crew boats for million 
this compares to million provided by investing activities in  which was due principally to million in proceeds from the sale of assets  offset in part by million of capital expenditures 
we do not have any financing arrangements that we are not required to disclose under generally accepted accounting principles 
we have outstanding approximately million in senior notes due the senior notes are unsecured and are required to be guaranteed by all of our significant subsidiaries 
the senior notes may be prepaid  at our option  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the redemption price declining ratably on august  and each of the succeeding two years 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  prevent us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense is at least to  except that we may incur additional debt under our credit facility up to a maximum aggregate amount of million 
the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we maintain two primary bank credit facilities 
one bank credit facility provides a million revolving line of credit that can be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by a mortgage on substantially all of our vessels other than those located in the north sea and brazil 
amounts borrowed under the bank credit facility mature on june  and bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on our leverage ratio 
as of february   we had million in stand by letters of credit outstanding under the bank credit facility and no outstanding borrowings 
the stand by betters of credit are used to secure temporary import bonds as required to import vessels into certain foreign locations 
the bank credit facility requires us to maintain certain debt service coverage and leverage ratios  minimum tangible net worth and mortgaged vessel values  and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
although the bank credit facility does impose some limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  it expressly permits distributions to us by our significant subsidiaries for scheduled principal and interest payments on the senior notes 
based on the current utilization and day rates for our gulf vessels  we may experience difficulty complying with the consolidated leverage ratio covenant in our million bank credit facility after june  this is due to expected borrowings under the norwegian kroner credit facility to fund the two platform supply vessels we are building  prior to seeing the benefit of the resulting cash flow from the new vessels until after they are placed in service 
with the exception of million in stand by letters of credit  we do not have any borrowings outstanding under this bank facility and do not expect to borrow any additional amounts under this facility to fund our operations during this period 
we have discussed this covenant with our bank lenders  and if current market conditions continue  we expect to revise the covenant during the second quarter of while we have historically been able to revise the financial covenants in our bank credit facilities in response to changing industry conditions  we cannot give assurances this covenant will be revised 
if we experience difficulty in complying with this covenant and are unable to revise it  our future borrowing capability  including the issuance of letters of credit  could be diminished  and we may be required to replace or secure with cash deposits the existing letters of credit 
we also maintain a revolving credit facility payable in norwegian kroner nok in the current amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this bank facility is reduced by nok million million every six months  with the nok million million balance of the commitment to expire in june as of february   we had nok million million of debt outstanding under the facility 
we also have a term loan in the amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this loan is reduced by nok million million every six months with the balance of the commitment to expire june as of february  several principal payments required by this loan had been prepaid  therefore  the entire balance of this loan is not due until maturity in june amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at nibor norwegian interbank offered rate plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate for these facilities was as of december  these facilities are collateralized by mortgages on certain of our north sea vessels 
we have received a written commitment  subject to execution of final loan documentation  for a new credit facility in the amount of nok million million 
this facility will replace the existing nok million revolving facility and will be used for general corporate purposes 
the new credit facility will be collateralized by a mortgage on the same vessels securing the existing credit facility and the two psvs under construction in norway when they are delivered 
the commitment is reduced by nok million million every six months beginning march  with the balance of the commitment to expire in seven years 
the new bank facility is expected to contain covenants that are substantially similar to those in the existing credit facility and require that our north sea operating unit maintain certain financial ratios and limits its ability to create liens  or merge or consolidate with other entities 
in june we signed definitive agreements to acquire two foot psvs for a cost of approximately nok million million 
the two state of the art  ut design vessels  equipped with dp dynamic positioning systems  are currently under construction in norway and are slated for delivery in may and september payment terms for each of the vessels call for payments equal to during construction and upon delivery 
also in the second quarter of  we executed agreements to build three foot crew boats in the us gulf for a total cost of approximately million with vessel deliveries expected during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of payment terms on the new crew boats call for progress payments throughout the construction period 
as of december   we had paid approximately million of the construction costs 
expenditures for these vessels are expected to total approximately million during we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our bank credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and our planned capital expenditures 
however  our cash generated from operations is dependent upon the day rates and utilization for our vessels  which in turn are affected by oil and gas prices and the expenditures for oil and gas exploration  development and production in the markets where we operate 
a prolonged decline in offshore industry activity would affect our cash generated from operations  and may also affect our ability to meet certain financial ratios that are required under our bank credit facilities  which could result in a reduction in our borrowing capability 
we intend to continue to position ourselves to pursue acquisitions and to selectively build new vessels that enhance our capabilities and enable us to enter new market areas 
depending upon the size of those investments  we also may require additional equity or debt financing 
we can give no assurances regarding the availability or terms of any possible transactions and the related debt and equity financing 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  fixed assets  deferred expenses  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  pension liabilities  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies to be critical policies due to the significant judgements  estimation processes and uncertainty involved for each in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization  operating performance and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of fixed asset impairments 
impairment of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
at december  goodwill amounted to million 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to enable their value to be fully realized 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
at december  net deferred tax assets amounted to million 
during the year ended december   we did not record any valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets 
deferred marine inspection costs 
we record the cost of major scheduled drydocking inspection costs for our vessels as deferred charges 
we amortize these deferred charges over the expected periods of benefit  typically ranging from two to five years 
the american institute of certified public accountants has issued an exposure draft for a proposed statement of position  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment  which would require major scheduled inspection costs to be expensed as costs are incurred 
if this proposed statement of position is adopted in its current form  we will be required to write off the balance of our deferred marine inspection costs  which totaled million at december   and expense future costs as incurred 
new accounting standards on june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  to prohibit use of the pooling of interest pooling method of accounting for business combinations initiated after the issuance date of sfas no 
sfas no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  by stating that goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment in a manner different from how other assets are tested for impairment 
sfas no 
establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment by requiring that goodwill be separately tested for impairment using a fair value approach rather than an undiscounted cash flow approach 
goodwill will be tested for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit  generally a level lower than that of the total entity 
sfas no 
requires entities to perform the first goodwill impairment test  by comparing the fair value with the book value of a reporting unit  on all reporting units within six months of adopting the statement 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment loss will be recognized and treated as a change in accounting principle 
goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment after the initial adoption of the statement on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
must be adopted at the beginning of a fiscal year 
accordingly  the company will no longer amortize goodwill effective january  amortization of goodwill for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
based on the company s initial interpretations of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the company does not believe the implementation of these statements will have a material impact on the company s cash flow or financial condition 
however  a change in the fair value of any of the company s significant subsidiaries could materially change this preliminary determination 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s net income  cash flows  or financial condition 
during august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
the company is presently evaluating the impact of implementing sfas no 
 but presently does not believe it will have a material impact on the company s net income  cash flows or financial condition 
in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
this sop provides guidance on accounting for certain costs and activities relating to property  plant  and equipment pp e 
for purposes of this sop  a project stage or timeline framework is used and pp e assets are accounted for at a component level 
costs incurred for pp e are classified into four stages preliminary  preacquisition  acquisition or construction and in service 
the sop requires  among other things  that preliminary  preacquisition and acquisition or construction stage costs  except for payments to obtain an option to acquire pp e  should be charged to expense as incurred 
costs related to pp e that are incurred during the in service stage  including costs of normal  recurring  or periodic repairs and maintenance activities  should be charged to expense as incurred unless the costs are incurred for acquisition of additional pp e or components of pp e or the replacement of existing pp e or components of pp e 
costs of planned major maintenance activities are not a separate pp e asset or component 
those costs should be charged to expense  except for acquisitions or replacements of components that are capitalizable under the in service stage guidance of this sop 
this sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this proposed pronouncement and has not quantified the proposed impact at this time 
as of december  the company had capitalized net deferred marine inspection costs of  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on derivative and financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities during trico s exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we have entered into a number of variable and fixed rate debt obligations  denominated in both the us dollar and the norwegian kroner norwegian debt payable in norwegian kroner  as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by monitoring our ratio of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in view of changing market conditions and from time to time altering that ratio by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facilities with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swap agreements  when deemed appropriate 
in february  we sold certain interest rate swap agreements for approximately  as of december  and we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt 
in we entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate exposure on a portion of our variable rate debt 
under the terms of the agreement we paid a fixed rate of interest on a notional amount of principal to a counterparty 
the counterparty  in turn  paid us a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
the effect of the swap agreements was to limit our interest rate exposure to a fixed percentage on a portion of the related debt obligation 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million  which included our senior notes million  marad bonds million  and marad bonds million 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million 
the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined using discounted future cash flows based on quoted market prices  where available  on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet dates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions utilized in computing fair values 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our long term variable rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million and million  respectively  which included our us and norwegian bank credit facilities 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
fair value was determined as noted above 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  and would increase annual interest expense by approximately  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our foreign subsidiaries collect revenues and pay expenses in several different foreign currencies 
we monitor the exchange rate of our foreign currencies and  when deemed appropriate  enter into hedging transactions in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
we also manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars
