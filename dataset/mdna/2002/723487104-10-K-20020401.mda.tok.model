critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified revenue recognition  software capitalization  goodwill and our use of estimates as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant as our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
for the fiscal years ended   and  the company recognized revenue over the life of the applicable contracts 
beginning in fiscal we will sell our software and  under certain circumstances  will recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
all other software sales will be recognized over the life of the applicable contracts in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type contracts sop 
software capitalization until  we did not sell software as a standalone product 
during  we made a decision to modify certain existing internal use software and attempt to sell it as actrellis 
at the time this decision was made  we determined that we would need to modify our existing software capitalization policy  such that in the future  we would now follow the guidance of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed for software to be sold externally 
the internal use software predecessor to actrellis was developed prior to the issuance of sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires certain costs attributable to internally developed software to be capitalized in the application development stage 
since the application development of actrellis predecessor occurred prior to the issuance of sop  no amounts related to actrellis development were capitalized at december  under sfas no 
 research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
additionally  software development costs are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for release to customers 
the company s actrellis software was released soon after technological feasibility was established in as a result  costs subsequent to achieving technological feasibility under sfas no 
have not been incurred before and all software development costs have been expensed through december  goodwill the company s intangibles consist primarily of goodwill from our acquisition of stockpoint accounted for under the purchase method 
the company is in the process of obtaining an independent valuation of the assets and liabilities it has acquired as well as identifying the intangible assets it has acquired in order to finalize its allocation of the purchase price of the transaction 
the company will finalize its valuation as soon as possible or within one year of the acquisition date 
the company s preliminary allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement based on the final determination of fair value 
under the transition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and long lived intangible assets related to the company s stockpoint acquisition have not been periodically amortized in fiscal use of estimates the company s preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates

in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  software license revenue is generally recognized when  the contracted is executed  all delivery obligations have been met  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence is determinable 
for some arrangements  we may provide services that are essential to the functionality of the software selected 
for these arrangements both the license revenue and services revenue will be recognized in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type contracts sop 
we will account for these arrangements under the percentage of completion contract method pursuant to sop maintenance revenue for technical product support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract

this revenue is generally recognized as the service is performed 
we record billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
our contracts typically have lengths of one or two years 
we report our revenue net of allowances and rebates 
cost of services cost of services consist of royalties to information providers as well as costs for bandwidth  storage of our servers in third party network data centers and certain costs associated with the maintenance of our infrastructure 
we also include certain payroll and related expenses pertaining to staff associated with client implementation  developing custom applications  performing editorial and quality assurance services and maintaining our network operations 
we have several different arrangements with information providers 
the majority of our contracts are based on royalty fees that are calculated monthly  based on the volume of a provider s information relayed to our customers

we believe under our current software engineering processes that the establishment of technological feasibility and general release substantially coincide 
as a result  no software development costs have been capitalized to date for software developed for external sales 
for software developed for internal use  expenses are capitalized while in the application development stage and expensed while in the preliminary and post implementation stages

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions including accounting  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative functions  as well as provisions for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
stock based compensation we recorded a charge for the amortization of deferred stock based compensation of approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation is a result of the issuance of stock options to employees  directors and affiliated parties with exercise prices per share determined for financial reporting purposes to be below the fair market value per share of our common stock at the date of the applicable grant 
this difference is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized as non cash compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the related options 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation that will be subsequently amortized as expense for each of the next four fiscal years  including options granted through december   is estimated to be as follows period amount in thousands year ending december   year ending december  year ending december  total  results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

years ended december  and revenue 
revenue totaled approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million in the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of stockpoint  which accounted for million of revenue 
after adjusting for the acquisition  revenues increased by million  an increase of over the prior year 
this increase was due to an overall increase in fees per customer as a result of our expanded product offerings and directing our sales efforts to enterprises that require larger  more comprehensive information solutions 
our average contract value increased approximately over the prior year 
we experienced revenue growth even as we lost customers  most of which were smaller  internet related customers 
at december  we had customers compared to  in the prior year 
stockpoint had approximately customers at december  out of our total in both and  no customer accounted for over of revenue 
although our total revenue has increased in recent periods  we cannot be certain that total revenue will grow in future periods or that it will grow at similar rates as in the past 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  after adjusting for cost of services related to the acquisition of stockpoint  of approximately million  cost of services increased by million to million  an increase as a percentage of revenue over the prior year to from 
the increase was primarily due to increases in certain payroll and related expenses  fees paid to network providers for bandwith and monthly fees for housing our servers in third party network data centers 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  after adjusting for research and development expense related to the stockpoint acquisition  of approximately million  research and development increased slightly by  to million  a slight decrease as a percentage of revenue over the prior year to from 
the absolute dollar increase was due to an increase in direct personnel costs and further development of our actrellis integration server software suite and hosting platform 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  after adjusting for the additional sales and marketing expense related to the stockpoint acquisition  sales and marketing expense decreased to million  a decrease as a percentage of revenue to from in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a significant headcount reduction in our sales  marketing and information provider management departments and reductions in advertising  trade shows and other marketing related expenses 
this offset an increase in commission expense that resulted from an increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  after adjusting for general and administrative costs related to the acquisition of stockpoint of approximately  our underlying general and administrative expenses increased to million  an increase as a percentage of revenue to from in the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in bad debt expense  certain professional fees including legal costs for failed merger and acquisition activity and an increase in corporate and franchise taxes 
amortization of intangibles 
in connection with the acquisition of stockpoint  we are in the process of obtaining an independent valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as identifying the intangible assets acquired in order to finalize the allocation of the purchase price of the transaction 
the valuation will be finalized within one year of the acquisition date 
for the year ending december  we will incur amortization expense once we have identified the intangible assets related to the acquisition 
restructuring 
in july our management took certain actions to further increase operational efficiencies and bring costs in line with revenues 
these measures included the involuntary terminations of employees  from sales and marketing  research and development and the general and administrative areas  as well as the consolidation of some of our leased office space  the closure of several of our offices and asset impairment charges 
as a consequence  we recorded a million charge to operations during the third quarter of for severance related payments to terminated employees  the accrual of future lease costs net of estimated sublease income and the write off of fixed assets for office locations that were closed or consolidated and assets that were abandoned or impaired 
as a result of these restructuring initiatives  we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately million in operating expenses 
however  there can be no assurance that such cost reductions can be sustained or that the estimated costs of such actions will not change 
we incurred no such restructuring charges for the year ended december  stock based compensation 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a reversal of unearned stock options 
as a percentage of revenue  stock based compensation decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the previous year 
this increase was mostly due to an increase in our customers to  at december  from at december  also contributing to this increase was a increase in the average monthly services revenue per customer and a increase in average license and set up fees for new customers due to the introduction of new products 
the introduction of our new products also resulted in follow on orders from existing customers 
in  no customer accounted for over of revenue and we do not anticipate that any one customer will account for more than of revenue in the year ending december  although our total revenue has increased in recent periods  we cannot be certain that total revenue will grow in future periods or that it will grow at similar rates as in the past 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of services decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to increases in revenue resulting in higher fees paid to information providers  and an increase in the number of employees in the implementation and content engineering  network operations  and professional services departments 
we anticipate that the cost of services will continue to grow in absolute dollars as we expand our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase was due to direct personnel costs and the development of our siteware software suite  content engine  hosting platform and other products 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in research and development expenditures 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars was due to a significant increase in compensation expense associated with the growth of our sales force  customer support and marketing programs  the opening of new sales offices in the united states  and the establishment of foreign offices in europe 
the decrease in sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in sales and marketing expenditures  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars resulted from an increase in personnel  certain facilities costs  accounting and legal fees  bad debt expense and bad debt reserves 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in general and administrative expenditures 
stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we have deferred stock compensation of million at december  we amortized million and million of deferred stock compensation in and respectively 
other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income from cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities offset by interest on capital leases 
other income  net  increased to million in from  in the significant increase from to was due to interest income earned on higher cash balances  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from both our series c and initial public offerings in july and august  respectively

net loss per common share basic net loss per common share was computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted net loss per share has not been presented since the impact of options  warrants and the conversion of preferred shares would have been antidilutive 
pro forma basic net loss excludes the amortization of deferred stock compensation  deemed preferred stock dividends  restructuring charges and the provision for impairment of investments of        and for the three months ending march  through december  in thousands  respectively 
pro forma basic net loss per common share has been computed as described above and also gives effect  even if anti dilutive  to common equivalent shares from preferred stock as if such conversion had occurred at the beginning of the period or at the date of original issuance  if later 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through private sales of equity and debt securities and through our initial public offering 
sales of equity securities included million of net proceeds from our august initial public offering of common stock and million of net proceeds received from the july private placement of convertible preferred stock  which converted into common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and million respectively 
we operate from leased premises in new york  satellite offices in san francisco  london and iowa 
our current aggregate annual rental obligations under these leases are approximately million for and for the years ended december  and  our capital expenditures were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for computers  hardware  software and professional services to design our new financial systems and networking equipment 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under a series of capital leases of computer and networking equipment and our facilities leases 
at the end of each capital lease term  we have the option to purchase the equipment  typically at the lesser of fair market value or of gross asset value 
we presently intend to exercise the purchase option for the majority of the leases 
in connection with the acquisition of stockpoint inc  a financial institution acting as a trustee for debenture holders is the beneficiary of an irrevocable standby letter of credit for million 
our obligation regarding the million letter of credit has been satisfied as of march  a leasing company is the beneficiary of a million irrevocable standby letter of credit with a financial institution securing their leasing agreement with us 
our landlord is the beneficiary of a  irrevocable standby letter of credit with a financial institution securing our new york office lease arrangement with them 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net losses of million  offset by million in non cash charges 
the non cash charges consist primarily of approximately million of depreciation  million of restructuring charge   of stock based compensation  and a  charge for impaired investments 
in addition  accounts receivable decreased by million  accrued restructuring expenses increased by million and prepaid expenses decreased by approximately  this was offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately  the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net losses of million and an increase in trade accounts receivable of million 
this was offset by million in non cash charges  of which stock based compensation accounted for million  an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in deferred revenue and a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net losses of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and an increase in trade accounts receivable of million offset by a million non cash charge for stock based compensation 
for the year ended december  the net cash used in investing activities was approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities resulted from million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
in addition  the acquisition of stockpoint resulted in a net cash outflow of approximately million 
this consisted primarily of debt repayments of approximately million and severance and other exit costs 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was principally for the purchase of marketable securities  equipment leasehold improvements and the rollout of our new financial system 
the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was principally for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
for the years ended december  net cash used by financing activities was approximately million 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the repayment of capital leases of million offset by approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
for the years ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million and million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock of million and the net proceeds from the sale of common stock upon completion of our initial public offering of million 
this was offset by repayments of our capital lease obligations of million and payment for the repurchase of treasury stock for million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of a warrant and stock options of  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was provided substantially by net proceeds generated from our issuances of series a and b preferred stock 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with the net proceeds from the series c preferred stock offering and our current cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  if we undertake significant acquisitions or make significant strategic investments  we may need to raise additional funds within that time 
we may also need to raise additional funds if competitive pressures force us to make unforseen expenditures  such as to acquire or develop new technology 
if we need to raise additional funds  we will likely do so through the issuance and sale of equity securities 
if this were to occur  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution and these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by these limitations

revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
this issue should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effects of these changes on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we do not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading purposes 
some of our investments may be subject to market risk which means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
exchange rate sensitivity 
we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as we currently do not have significant amount of revenue and assets denominated in a foreign currency and have minimal expenses paid in a foreign currency 
currently  the exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses in the uk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
as of december  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was not material
