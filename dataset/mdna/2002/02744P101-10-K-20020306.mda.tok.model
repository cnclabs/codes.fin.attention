approximately company sales managers located in sales offices throughout the united states support the independent agents 
the company s products generally provide discounts to insureds that utilize preferred provider organizations ppos 
the company owns a preferred provider network and also contracts with other networks to ensure cost effective health care choices to its customers 
summary of results the company s financial performance improved considerably in the key factor in the improvement was the health loss ratio  which by year end had dropped to its lowest point in over three years 
this positive momentum is attributed to strategic decisions made in late including aggressively raising prices on new and renewal business  focusing marketing efforts for small group products in markets with the best prospects for profitability and future growth  redesigning products to meet the changing needs of today s consumers  and expanding the distribution of the company s medone products 
during the first quarter of  the company received an adverse decision by the eleventh circuit federal court of appeals affirming a jury verdict in a lawsuit brought against the company by skilstaf  inc  an employee leasing company 
as a result  the company s reported results reflect an after tax charge of million or per share 
see item  legal proceedings for more detailed information regarding this case 
management has characterized this charge as a nonrecurring item in the following discussion of results of operations due to the unusual nature and size of the lawsuit and because it relates to a contract inforce between and following is a discussion of management s strategic decisions made in late and their effect on the company s operations product pricing significant technological advancements in the health care field have continued in the past few years 
as a result of this and other factors  the costs associated with health care have also increased 
in the face of escalating claims cost trends that emerged in late and  management implemented significant premium rate increases on the company s existing block of business 
this action contributed greatly to the improvement in the health loss ratio and resulting earnings performance 
after the effect of buydowns in coverage and terminations  average medical premium per member per month increased from to in comparison  average medical claims costs increased only for the same period 
management is committed to a pricing strategy intended to maintain premium rate increases at a level necessary to achieve the company s target profit margins 
focused small group marketing management continues to analyze the company s geographic markets and is focusing its marketing efforts in those areas that offer the greatest potential for appropriate returns 
as a consequence of government regulations and rapidly rising health care inflation resulting from advances in technology and drug treatments  the company s small group business experienced losses in and since that time  management has taken steps to return the company s small group business to profitability 
those steps included exiting from certain unprofitable markets  shifting sales and marketing energies away from underperforming markets and realigning the company s small group agent force to producers with a commitment to the company 
as a result of these actions and the premium rate increases previously discussed  the company s small group business has improved significantly over the past two years and is currently contributing to the company s improved financial performance 
as anticipated  these focused efforts to improve profitability resulted in a decline in membership and revenues throughout management is currently taking steps to return the company s small group business to a growth mode while continuing to protect its margins 
management remains committed to this business and believes that this large and growing sector of the economy has significant revenue and earnings potential 
product redesign a significant portion of the company s product portfolio was redesigned during to keep pace with changes in the marketplace and to maximize the company s competitiveness 
consumers seem to be willing to accept higher co payments and deductibles in exchange for affordable premiums and protection from major medical bills 
the company s new products for small groups and individuals are designed to provide more affordable coverage for major medical expenses by shifting the financial responsibility for routine day to day health care to the patient 
these new products feature attractive rates  real choice and protection from catastrophic medical costs 
the company has been introducing these products to its sales force for the past several months  and the agent reaction has been enthusiastic 
in markets where the products have been fully launched  management has seen a positive trend in orders and quote requests 
medone expansion recognizing the significant earnings potential of the medone product line  management continues to take steps to expand the distribution of this business 
there are a number of key factors that make medone a strategic focus and an attractive product line to sell 
the general regulatory environment allows the company expanded flexibility in pricing  risk selection and plan design 
the product line features higher deductibles and co payments  thereby increasing consumers involvement in health care cost decisions 
in addition  the medone business is well positioned in a slowing economy in which employers are faced with reducing their workforce or dropping their group health coverage 
medone represented of the company s medical membership at the end of  compared with at the end of this shift in the company s product mix contributed to the improvement in the health loss ratio 
while medone products are more costly to sell and administer than small group products  the increased underwriting and risk management flexibility results in a lower loss ratio 
the lower loss ratio was somewhat offset by the increase in the expense ratio during management expects this product line to represent about half of the company s revenues by outlook for increasing premium rates and realigning marketing efforts caused a drop in the company s new member enrollment and an increase in existing membership terminations resulting in decreased revenues throughout while this consequence was anticipated  management believes membership and revenues in will remain flat with with some further decline during the first half of before starting to improve by mid year 
premium rate increases will moderate considerably during  which should improve persistency of small group membership 
in addition  the introduction and roll out of new products is expected to have a positive impact on new sales 
the company is currently conducting significant marketing campaigns to recruit new medone and dental agents 
these efforts are also attracting agents who want to sell the company s full line of products causing the company s force of professional  licensed agents selling small group products to grow 
management also believes that competitive pressures should ease in as other small group insurance carriers either exit the small group market or implement significant rate increases 
management expects the health loss ratio to continue to improve  but at a more moderate rate during based on the company s significantly improved financial performance in the last two quarters of  management anticipates earnings per share to be between and  including the effect of the nonamortization provisions of a new accounting standard 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for a detailed discussion of new accounting standards and the related impact on the company 
while there may be material upside potential to these estimates  the guidance is based on rapidly emerging positive trends  tempered by inherent variables in this business 
see cautionary factors below for a detailed description of inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described 
comparison of results of operations the company experienced unrelated nonrecurring charges during and as these nonrecurring items were not reflective of the ongoing operations of the company  management has chosen to exclude their effects from the comparison of results of operations and to describe each item separately 
the following table illustrates the effect of nonrecurring items on the company s results year ended december  in thousands income loss before nonrecurring item    nonrecurring item  net of tax   net income loss    a summary description of each of the nonrecurring items is as follows during the third quarter of  the company ceased marketing and terminated all small group business in florida  all small group and individual health business in maryland and all remaining business in minnesota over a period of months 
this decision was made after it became clear to management that certain regulatory challenges existed that made it impossible to return these markets to profitability 
the company recorded a million after tax charge in for a premium deficiency reserve to recognize expected losses related to highly regulated markets 
during the first quarter of  the company received an adverse decision by the eleventh circuit federal court of appeals affirming a jury verdict in a lawsuit brought against the company by skilstaf  inc  an employee leasing company 
the company recognized an after tax charge of million or per share during the first quarter of representing the full loss including punitive damages and other expenses 
in july  at the direction of the district court  the company paid the full amount of the verdict plus interest 
this case is now closed 
years ended december  and insurance premiums decreased to million in from million in premium revenues have decreased as a result of the company s membership decline 
as discussed above  membership reductions have resulted from product repricing  market exits and focusing marketing efforts in profitable markets 
medical membership declined by  members during the company s change in its product mix has also impacted premium revenue 
the medone business  which has become a larger percentage of the company s total business  has a smaller premium per member compared with the declining small group business 
partially offsetting the membership decline and the change in the product mix is the effect of increasing premium rates 
the health segment loss ratio improved basis points to for compared to for the health loss ratio is at its lowest point in over three years 
the improvement in the health loss ratio is due in part to improved performance on the company s small group business resulting from repricing efforts 
in  average premiums per member per month increased at a higher rate than average claims costs per member resulting in a lower loss ratio 
the health loss ratio also benefited  to a lesser degree  from the change in product mix to a larger percentage of medone business  which has a lower loss ratio 
the life segment loss ratio remained relatively stable with the prior year at for compared with for net investment income decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted mainly from a decrease in the annual investment yield

as anticipated  the health segment expense ratio  excluding the first quarter litigation charge  increased to in from in the increase largely reflected the change in the company s product mix 
medone business has higher agent commissions and issue costs than small group products  but lower claim costs 
the decrease in premium volume also contributed to the increase in the health expense ratio 
for  management expects the health segment expense ratio to increase slightly primarily as the result of investments in the company s distribution system and other selling costs and a continued expansion of the medone business 
the health segment combined ratio  which represents the sum of the health loss and expense ratios  improved basis points to for from for the improvement in the combined ratio resulted in an improvement in pre tax income of million to the company in interest expense on the outstanding balance of the company s line of credit decreased to million in from million in the interest rate charged on the line of credit is tied to the short term borrowing rate  which declined throughout most of resulting in decreased interest expense for the company

years ended december  and insurance premiums decreased to million for from  million reported for the company acquired the majority of the fully insured group health business of continental assurance company cna on january  premiums on the cna block of business declined approximately million from to  which accounted for the majority of the decrease in premium 
the remainder of the decline in premiums from the prior year resulted from declining small group membership due to the exit from unprofitable markets 
partially offsetting the impact of the declining membership was the continued increase in premiums per member per month 
the company s average fully insured medical premium per member per month increased to  compared to for the health segment loss ratio improved basis points to in from reported in  excluding the nonrecurring charge 
the significant improvement was due to management s actions and strategies implemented during to manage medical inflation 
these actions included premium increases  claims cost control initiatives and the exit from unprofitable small group markets and the related release of premium deficiency reserves 
the improvement also reflected increased sales of medone products  which are priced for a lower loss ratio due to its increased deductibles and co payments 
the life segment loss ratio improved to for from in net investment income decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted from a slight decrease in average invested assets from to average invested assets at cost decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of investment gains and losses are realized in the normal investment process in response to market opportunities

the expense ratio includes commissions  general and administrative expenses  premium taxes and assessments

medone business  which expanded significantly during  has higher agent commissions and issue costs than small group products  but lower claim costs 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the company received a one time assessment from the state of minnesota related to the company s exit from the medone health insurance market in that state in early the assessment was million in excess of the company s original provision for the assessment 
management expects no similar assessments from other exited markets 
the decrease in premium volume also contributed to the increase in the health expense ratio 
the health segment combined ratio  which represents the sum of the health loss and expense ratios  improved basis points to for from for the improvement in the combined ratio resulted in an improvement in pre tax income of million to the company in interest expense on the outstanding balance on the company s line of credit agreement remained flat compared to at million 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets declined from to to million from million 
the effective tax rate for was compared with for the change in the effective tax rate relates to the amortization of non deductible goodwill and other permanent items in relation to pre tax income 
the company reported pre tax income of million in compared to a pre tax loss of million in critical accounting policies liabilities for unpaid claims the company s liabilities for unpaid claims are based on an estimation process that is complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
these estimates are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
the amount recorded for unpaid claims liabilities is sensitive to judgments and assumptions made in the estimation process 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining claims cost trends  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported  changes in the timing of claims submission patterns from providers  changes in the company s speed of processing claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
actual conditions could differ from those assumed in the estimation process given the general economic and regulatory environment of the company s operations 
due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported in the company s statement of operations for a particular period under different conditions or using different assumptions 
as is common in the health insurance industry  the company believes that actual results may vary within a reasonable range of possible outcomes 
management believes that the recorded liabilities for unpaid claims at december  is in the higher end of a reasonable range of outcomes 
management closely monitors and evaluates developments and emerging trends in claims costs to determine the reasonableness of judgments made 
a retrospective test is performed on prior period claims liabilities and  as adjustments to the liabilities become necessary  the adjustments are reflected in current operations 
management believes that the amount of medical and other benefits payable is adequate to cover the company s liabilities for unpaid claims as of december  in determining the liability for unpaid claims at december   management considered the potential impact of the september  events 
although the events of september  did not have a direct material effect on the company  management anticipates an indirect impact including  but not limited to  increased utilization by the general population of mental health services for stress  anxiety  depression and similar conditions in the fourth quarter 
also  subsequent bio terrorism threats and attacks may result in increased utilization of health care services including office visits  laboratory tests and prescription drugs for flu like symptoms in the fourth quarter 
while the impact of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes adequate provision has been made for such claims as of december  accordingly  the outcome of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
should the outcome be that minimal health benefits are incurred  the result would be positive to the earnings of the company 
litigation the company is involved in various legal and regulatory actions occurring in the normal course of business 
the liabilities recorded for litigation are generally determined on a case by case basis and typically relate to disputes over policy coverage and benefits 
in determining the amount to be recorded  judgments are made by management based on the facts and the merits of the case  advice from outside legal counsel  the general legal and regulatory environment of the originating state  historical results of similar cases and other relevant factors 
the average cost for the settlement of the actions occurring in the normal course of the company s business approximates  however  inherent uncertainties surround legal proceedings and actual results could differ from those assumed in determining the liabilities 
the possibility exists that a decision could be rendered against the company including punitive or other damage awards  which may have a material impact on the results of the company s operations 
in estimating the liabilities for litigation as of december   the company considered the recent unfavorable litigation environment it has experienced in certain states 
management s evaluation of the likely impact of these actions could change in the future and an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow of a future period 
see item  legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the company s material pending litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the new rules will impact the company in two ways 
first  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
second  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will be subject to an initial impairment test in accordance with the statements  and any remaining balance of goodwill and intangible assets will be subject to future annual impairment testing 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per year 
the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives in  effective as of january   by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to their carrying amounts book value  including goodwill 
in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units  management will consider valuation techniques such as the quoted market price of the company s stock  the present value of future cash flows and market comparison of similar assets and liabilities 
at december   the company s book value per share was and was significantly higher than the quoted market price per share 
the company has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
if management determines that the quoted market price per share is the appropriate measure of the company s fair value  the resulting impairment would be greater than of the amount of goodwill and other intangibles on the company s december  balance sheet 
if it is determined that an impairment exists as of january   the charge would be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated financial statements and would have no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of cash flow consist primarily of insurance premiums  administrative fee revenue and investment income 
the primary uses of cash include payment of medical and other benefits  selling  general and administrative expenses and debt service costs 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of medical and other benefits and other operating expenses 
the company s investment policies are designed to maximize yield  preserve principal and provide liquidity to meet anticipated payment obligations 
the company s cash provided by operations was million for and cash used in operations was million for the year ended excluding the payment for the skilstaf litigation  cash provided by operations was million for the increase in cash flows from operations is primarily the result of improved underwriting margins in over consistent with the company s earnings  cash flows increased significantly during the last half of the company is well capitalized with a debt to total capital ratio of at december   which is low by industry standards 
the company s insurance subsidiaries operate in states that require certain levels of regulatory capital and surplus and may restrict dividends to their parent companies 
the insurance regulator in the insurer s state of domicile may disapprove any dividend which  together with other dividends paid by an insurance company in the prior months  exceeds the regulatory maximum  computed as the lesser of of statutory surplus or total statutory net gain from operations as of the end of the preceding calendar year 
based upon the results of operations and capital position of the company s insurance subsidiaries as of december   as filed with the insurance regulators  dividends are limited to million without prior regulatory approval until september  at which time the aggregate amount available without regulatory approval is million 
in february  a million dividend was paid to the parent company by an insurance subsidiary 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted risk based capital rbc standards for life and health insurers designed to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to various business risks faced by such insurers 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
at december   each of the company s insurance subsidiaries had rbc ratios substantially above the levels that would require company or regulatory action 
during  the company purchased  shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million 
in october  the company reached its maximum authorized purchase threshold  bringing the total purchased under the program to million shares at an aggregate purchase price of million 
as described in item  business general  the company has been in discussions with cobalt regarding cobalt s desire to reduce its investment in the company 
cobalt s wholly owned subsidiary  bcbsuw owned of the outstanding common stock of the company at february  the outcome of these discussions could result in a limited share repurchase and secondary offering of the company s shares owned by bcbsuw 
the company maintains a revolving bank line of credit agreement with a maximum commitment of million 
at december   the outstanding balance of advances under the credit agreement was million 
as collateral for the outstanding balance  the company is required to maintain a minimum cash deposit of million in an account at the lender s institution 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants which  among other matters  require the company to achieve certain minimum financial results and restrict the company s ability to incur additional debt  pay future cash dividends and dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  and anticipates continued compliance in the foreseeable future 
the company believes that the implementation of fas will not adversely impact its compliance with debt covenants 
the credit agreement was amended in january and april to revise the minimum financial requirements of certain covenants 
the april amendment also revised the company s applicable interest rate on outstanding loans and the schedule of mandatory future commitment reductions including a million maximum commitment reduction from million to million 
annual principal amounts that mature related to the credit agreement are million in  million in  million in and million in the company anticipates using future cash flows from operations and existing capital and surplus  if necessary  to fund these capital resource needs 
the company does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and intends to employ its earnings in the continued development of its business 
the company s future dividend policy will depend on its earnings  capital requirements  debt covenant restrictions  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
market risk exposure the primary investment objective of the company is to maximize investment income while controlling risks and preserving principal 
the company seeks to meet this investment objective through diversity of coupon rates  liquidity  investment type  industry  issuer  duration and geographic location 
investment grade debt securities made up of the company s total investment portfolio at december  the below investment grade debt securities were investment grade when purchased and subsequently downgraded 
none of the below investment grade securities were in default at december  the company uses outside investment managers who seek to maximize return on the portfolio within the company s investment guidelines 
at december   million or of the company s total investment portfolio was invested in debt securities 
the bond portfolio had an average quality rating of aa and aa at december  and  respectively  as measured by moody s investor service 
almost the entire portfolio was classified as available for sale 
the company had no investment mortgage loans  nonpublicly traded securities except for principal only strips of us government securities  real estate held for investment or financial derivatives 
the market value of the total investment portfolio exceeded amortized cost by million at december  as compared with december  when the amortized cost of the total investment portfolio exceeded market value by million 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient for its cash flow needs and that liquidation of its investment portfolio will not be necessary 
the primary market risk affecting the company is interest rate risk 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical decline in fair value of shareholders equity is estimated to be million after tax at december  this amount represents approximately of the company s shareholders equity 
at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings under the line of credit facility approximated the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
inflation health care costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise at a rate that exceeds the consumer price index 
the company s cost control measures and premium rate increases are designed to reduce the adverse effect of medical cost inflation on its operations 
in addition  the company uses its underwriting and medical management capabilities to help control inflation in health care costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will fully offset the impact of inflation or that premium revenue increases will equal or exceed increasing health care costs
