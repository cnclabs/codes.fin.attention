fiscal compared to fiscal home sales housing revenues for fiscal were higher than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
the revenue increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the average price of the homes delivered and a increase in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered was the result of increases in selling prices  a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas and an increase in the dollar amount of options that our home buyers selected 
during fiscal  the company s homebuyers paid approximately above the base selling price of a home for options and lot premiums  compared to in fiscal the increase in the number of homes delivered is primarily due to the larger backlog of homes to be delivered at the beginning of fiscal as compared to fiscal the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes and billion  homes for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the value of new contracts signed in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the average selling price of the homes due primarily to an increase in base selling prices  a shift in the location of homes sold to more expensive areas and an increase in the dollar amount of options selected by our home buyers offset in part by a decrease in the average number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale and the resulting decrease in the number of homes for which the company signed sales contracts 
the decrease in the number of communities was the result of increased regulatory requirements that delayed the opening of some new communities and new sections of some existing communities 
at october   the backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  as compared to the billion  homes backlog at october  the terrorist attacks of september  impacted us most severely in the first few weeks immediately after the events as consumer confidence dropped  the stock market declined and the company s business slowed 
since then  deposit trends for new homes have improved  although they have been quite volatile from week to week 
in the six week period since october   the total number of deposits was approximately higher than the same period of fiscal on a per community basis  deposits were down approximately over the same period 
compared to the previous five year average for the six week period  deposits were approximately higher on a per community basis 
based upon the lower backlog of homes to be delivered and the lower number of outstanding deposits at october  as compared to october   home building revenues for fiscal may be lower than fiscal home building revenues 
housing costs as a percentage of housing sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than costs  lower land and improvement costs  and improved operating efficiencies offset in part by higher inventory write offs 
the company incurred million in write offs in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal land sales the company operates a land development and sales operation in its south riding master planned community located in loudoun county  virginia 
the company is developing several other master planned communities in which it may sell lots to other builders 
the decrease in land sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to fewer lots being available for sale in south riding in fiscal than in  offset in part by increased sales of lots from several of the company s other master planned communities 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures in fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture to develop and sell land owned by its venture partner 
under the terms of the agreement  the company has the right to purchase up to a specified number of lots with the majority of the lots to be sold to other builders 
in fiscal  the joint venture sold its first group of home sites to other builders and to the company 
the company recognizes its share of earnings from the sale of lots to other builders 
the company does not recognize earnings from lots it purchases but reduces its cost basis in the lots by its share of the earnings on those lots 
earnings from this joint venture are expected to continue into fiscal  but at a significantly lower level 
interest and other income interest and other income increased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase in interest income  the gain from the sale of an office building constructed by the company  and an increase in earnings from the company s ancillary businesses  offset in part by reduced management fee income and gains from the sale of miscellaneous assets recognized in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increased spending was primarily due to the increase in housing revenues in fiscal over fiscal  and costs related to the development of the company s master planned communities 
sg a as a percentage of total revenue was the same in fiscal and fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal home sales housing revenues for fiscal were higher than those of fiscal by approximately million  or 
the revenue increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of the homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered was the result of increased selling prices  a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas and an increase in the number of homes delivered from our highly amenitized country club communities 
the increase in the number of homes delivered is primarily due to a increase in the number of communities from which the company was delivering homes and the larger backlog of homes to be delivered at the beginning of fiscal as compared to fiscal the value of new sales contracts signed totaled billion  homes and billion  homes for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the value of new contracts signed in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the average selling price of the homes due primarily to the location  size and increase in base selling prices and an increase both in the average number of communities in which the company was offering homes for sale and in the number of contracts signed per community 
as of october   the backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  approximately higher than the billion  homes backlog as of october  the increase in backlog at october  was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of new contracts signed and price increases  as previously discussed 
based on the company s current backlog and current healthy demand  the company believes that fiscal will be another record year 
housing costs as a percentage of housing sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than costs  lower land and improvement costs  and improved operating efficiency offset  in part  by higher inventory write offs 
the company incurred million in write offs in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal land sales in march  the company acquired land for homes  apartments  retail  office and industrial space in the master planned community of south riding  located in loudoun county  virginia 
the company will use some of the property for its own home building operations and will also sell home sites and commercial parcels to other builders 
the company recorded its first sale of land from this operation in the third quarter of fiscal the company is also developing several master planned communities in which it may sell land to other builders 
the increase in land sales in fiscal over fiscal was due to the full year of operations in fiscal compared to six months in fiscal at south riding and the first sale of lots at one of its other master planned communities 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures in fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture to develop and sell land owned by its venture partner 
under the terms of the agreement  the company has the right to purchase a specified number of home sites on which to build homes with the majority of the home sites to be sold to other builders 
in fiscal  the joint venture sold its first group of home sites to other builders and to the company 
the company recognizes its share of earnings from the sale of home sites to other builders 
the company reduces its cost basis in the home sites it purchases from the joint venture by its share of the earnings on those home sites 
interest and other income interest and other income increased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was principally due to gains from the sale of miscellaneous assets  offset in part by a reduction of fee income 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increased spending was primarily due to the increase in the number of communities from which the company was selling  the increase in the number of homes delivered  costs associated with the company s expansion into new markets  expenses incurred in the opening of divisional offices to manage the growth and spending related to the development of its master planned communities and land sales 
interest expense the company determines interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis for its home building operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for its land sales operations 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense will vary depending on many factors including the period of time that the land was owned  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of its inventory during those periods 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense was slightly higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal and lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes income taxes for fiscal  and were provided at effective rates of  and  respectively 
extraordinary loss from extinguishment of debt in january  the company called for the redemption of all of its outstanding senior subordinated notes due at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the redemption resulted in the recognition of an extraordinary loss in of million  net of  of income tax benefit 
the loss represented the redemption premium and a write off of unamortized deferred issuance costs 
capital resources and liquidity funding for the company s operations has been principally provided by cash flows from operations  unsecured bank borrowings and  from time to time  the public debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  has improved as operating results have improved 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  in the coming fiscal year will continue to be strong  but will be dependent on the level of revenues from the delivery of homes and the company s results of operations 
the company has used its cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public debt to acquire additional land for new communities  to pay for land development and construction costs needed to meet the requirements of the company s continuing expansion of the number of selling communities  to repurchase company stock and to reduce debt 
the company expects that inventories will continue to increase and is currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with banks  of which million extends through march and million extends through february at october   the company had million of loans and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
in november  the company issued million of senior subordinated notes due december the company intends to use the net proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its activities through a combination of existing cash resources  cash flow from operations and other sources of credit similar in nature to those the company has accessed in the past 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home and the company generally sells its homes before commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company utilizes both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument 
the company does not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company is required to refinance such debt 
the table below sets forth  as of october   the company s long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt fiscal weighted weighted year of average average expected interest interest maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter   total   fair value at october    the company has a million revolving credit facility with banks of which million extends through march and million extends through february interest is payable on borrowings at above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by the company from time to time 
the company had million of borrowings against this facility at october  and the above table assumes that these borrowings will be repaid at the final maturity date of the facility 
the company had fixed million of the borrowings at through an interest rate swap until march a subsidiary of the company has a million line of credit with a bank to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the bank and bears interest at the banks overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october  the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line 
borrowing under this line is included in the fiscal year maturities 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by the company by approximately million per year
