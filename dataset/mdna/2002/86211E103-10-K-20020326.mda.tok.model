item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  our critical accounting policies and those factors set forth below under factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of data storage management software and services 
we operate in two business segments  managed storage services and professional services  and provide these services to our customers at their data centers  both onsite at the customers facilities or in a third party hosting center 
our managed storage services include pacs  storbackup  stormanage  and storfusion storage services 
our storconsulting professional services are designed to help enterprise organizations design their primary data storage systems and optimize their existing data storage infrastructures 
since our inception in  we have provided our managed storage services to our customers in our storage point of presence  or s pop  data centers 
an s pop data center can be located either within a customer s own on site data center  or within a data center operated by a hosting service provider 
we opened our first s pop data center in houston in may through december   we operated s pop data centers in the metropolitan areas of atlanta  austin  boston  chicago  dallas  detroit  houston  los angeles  new york  san francisco  seattle  washington  dc  amsterdam  frankfurt and london 
in  we identified a significant opportunity to provide our software and services to service providers in order to enable them to manage their storage infrastructure and provide new value to their customers 
as a result  we developed and began marketing our storfusion offering 
due to increased interest in our software and services from large enterprise organizations  our addition of storfusion customers  and interest in our storos operating system as a stand alone product  along with weakening demand for storage services by customers inside hosting service provider data centers  we shifted our focus to marketing to large enterprise customers and storfusion customers and on the development and commercialization of our software 
therefore  we scaled back the sales and marketing activities for our fully managed pacs primary storage service offerings and focused on developing and enhancing our software and services that enterprise customers  telecommunications companies and system integrators were demanding 
in the future  we expect to focus on selling solutions that deliver high value to customers  including our software based offering  storfusion 
we are in the process of commercializing our storos operating system as a stand alone software application  to enable customers to use our solutions in managing their own storage infrastructures more efficiently and effectively 
we expect to begin selling our software directly to customers during the second half of since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
we believe that we will continue to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven  and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our company difficult 
we believe that you should not rely on the period to period comparison of our operating results to predict our future performance 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by new companies in rapidly evolving industries 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants disclose their critical accounting policies in the discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  and provision for income taxes described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
revenues revenues consist of i fees from customer use of our managed storage services  which include pacs storage services  stormanage storage services  and storfusion storage services  ii professional services fees  and iii proceeds from data storage equipment sales to customers 
revenues are recognized in accordance with the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues from our pacs and stormanage storage services primarily include monthly service fees charged on a per usage basis and are recognized as the managed storage services are provided 
our storfusion services include fees for launch and enablement services and monthly service fees 
revenues from launch and enablement services are recognized ratably over the period the services are provided 
monthly service fees are charged on a per usage basis and are recognized as the managed storage services are provided 
revenues from professional service engagements are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and are adjusted monthly for the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates 
we determine the percentage of completion of our contracts by comparing costs incurred to date to total estimated costs 
contract costs include all direct labor and expenses related to the contract performance 
equipment sales are recognized when the equipment is delivered to the customer or placed into service 
impairment of long lived assets we continually review the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment to determine whether there are any indications of impairment losses 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we conducted an impairment review of long lived assets  primarily storage hardware assets used in delivering our fully managed storage services within our traditional s pop data centers 
we calculated the expected net undiscounted cash flows of each s pop data center to determine which group of assets was impaired 
for those assets where impairment was present  a loss was recognized for the difference between the asset carrying values and fair market values 
we determined fair market value based on multiple quotes from third party data storage equipment resellers 
in conducting the impairment review  we separated assets in production assets to be held and used from idle assets assets to be disposed of 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings and substantial downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due  to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
provision for income taxes we incurred a net taxable loss in  and  and therefore did not record a provision for income taxes in these periods 
as of december   we had a federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million  which may be used  subject to limitations  to offset future state and federal taxable income through and  respectively 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against the entire net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards because we are uncertain that we will be able to realize the benefit of the carryforwards before they expire 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in managed storage service revenues increased from  in to million in the increase resulted primarily from the increase in the number of customers in we had customers under contract to receive our managed storage services at december   and over customers at the end of professional service revenues increased from million in to million in the increase resulted primarily from the increase in the number of professional service engagements in in  we performed professional service engagements for customers of emc corporation and compaq computer corp 
that accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total consolidated revenues 
approximately of our revenues in were represented by data storage equipment sales 
during  we had no data storage equipment sales 
the relative contributions of each of our segments to our total revenues in may not be indicative of future periods  however  as we shift the focus of our sales and marketing efforts to selling software and professional services to large enterprise organizations and service providers 
cost of revenues cost of managed storage service revenues increased from million in to million in the opening of additional s pop data centers in and the operation of   and s pop data centers during each consecutive quarter of caused the increase 
we had active s pop data centers at the end of accordingly  costs incurred in the operation of an s pop data center  such as depreciation of capital equipment  personnel costs  networking costs and facility costs were all higher in cost of professional service revenues increased from million in to million in the increase was caused by an increase in the number of professional services personnel in costs of equipment revenues were million in since we did not sell equipment in  we did not incur the associated costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was caused primarily by an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and an increase in promotional and advertising activities in in addition  higher direct sales related compensation expenses  such as commissions and bonuses  were incurred in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was caused by an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel in  as well as increased information technology and facilities costs incurred as a result of our growth in in addition  we incurred higher consulting and professional fees in as a result of our transition to a public company 
research and development research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was caused primarily by an increase in the number of technology and engineering personnel in  as well as higher costs incurred in connection with technology and research activities  such as equipment and depreciation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation increased from million in to million in in  we incurred a full year of amortization of deferred stock compensation for stock options granted with exercise prices deemed to be less than the fair value of common stock at the dates of grant 
interest income interest income increased from million in to million in the increase resulted from our higher average cash and investment balances during as a result of our equity financings 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in to million in the increase resulted from higher capital lease obligations under which interest expense was incurred in years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in managed storage service revenues increased from million in to million in the increase resulted from more capacity under management 
our customer base in consisted of companies for whom we managed larger volumes of data  primarily with our back up services 
accordingly  our average annualized revenue per customer increased each quarter in one managed storage service customer  merrill lynch  accounted for approximately of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  approximately of our total consolidated revenues earned in the year ended december  were recognized from fees paid for non recurring customer contract renegotiations 
in addition  in  our new managed storage service customer base consisted of a higher ratio of large enterprise customers to internet related companies than in the capacity under management in hosting service provider s pop data centers declined in the second half of as a result of the weakening economy and related decline in demand for services within the data centers of hosting service providers 
we anticipate that due to our focus on selling our software and related services  we may encounter longer sales cycles and will incur lower average selling prices per unit 
although we believe that potential profit from these sales is greater than that from our fully managed storage service offerings  we expect that the size of each sale will generally be smaller 
therefore  in  we anticipate that revenues from managed storage services may decrease on a quarterly basis  which may be partially offset by an increase in revenues from sales and licensing of our software and related services 
professional service revenues decreased from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in the number of professional service engagements in in  we performed subcontracted professional service engagements for customers of emc corporation and compaq computer corp 
that accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total consolidated revenues 
in the second half of  we focused our professional service organization on delivering higher scale and increased value added services  and we performed fewer sub contracting engagements 
as a result  we performed fewer overall professional service engagements and our professional service revenues declined 
we expect to continue performing direct professional service engagements that are both strategic and provide higher value to the customer 
however  these engagements are not as frequent as those that we had performed under various subcontracting agreements with hardware vendors 
as such  we do not anticipate immediate growth in revenues from professional services in during and  we had no data storage equipment sales 
cost of revenues cost of managed storage service revenues increased from million in to million in the increase resulted primarily from higher depreciation and equipment maintenance expense related to equipment used in we had more capacity under management in than we did in and needed to procure more data storage capital equipment to satisfy this increase 
however  our gross margins from providing managed storage services increased from in to in we achieved this improvement through greater efficiencies from the equipment deployed and personnel required to manage the storage capacity 
our storos operating system allowed our delivery of managed storage services to scale as capacity under management increased 
as a result of an impairment recorded in the quarter ended december  see impairment charge and other related costs below  the company recognized a charge of million to write down certain managed storage services assets to fair market value 
as a result  the company expects its depreciation expense to decline in in addition  we recorded charges related to long term fiber contracts and other s pop data center related charges  such as unutilized floor space  that will also reduce the cost of managed storage services in the future 
cost of professional service revenues decreased from million in to million in the decrease was caused by a decrease in the number of professional services personnel in our professional service organization was scaled down in the second half of as a result of our performing fewer subcontracting engagements 
subcontracting engagements required us to maintain a large group of consultants due to the unpredictability of the timing and volume of these engagements at any point in time 
as a result of a smaller  more focused professional services group  we were able to increase gross margins from professional services from in to in since we did not sell equipment in and  we did not incur the associated costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was caused primarily by an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel in the first half of also  because revenues increased during  we incurred higher direct sales related compensation expenses  such as commissions and fees paid to resellers 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily caused by higher salary and related costs in as a result of more general and administrative personnel in the first half of in addition  we incurred higher insurance costs  professional service fees  and legal costs in  our first full year as a public company  than in finally  we incurred higher facilities and related costs in as we established a new corporate headquarters 
research and development research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was caused primarily by higher salary and related costs in as a result of more research and development personnel in  specifically within software development 
we also incurred higher consulting costs in as we initiated software development projects relating to the enhancement of our storos operating system 
consulting costs were significant in the first half of  and were reduced in the second half as we continued to add full time software development personnel 
depreciation of fixed assets  equipment and maintenance costs all increased in as we procured equipment used in our development  interoperability and quality assurance activities 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased from million in to million in the decrease in resulted from the termination of certain compensatory stock options as a result of employee terminations before such options vested 
impairment charge and other related costs in  we recorded asset impairment charges of million  or per share  and other one time charges of million  or per share 
as discussed above  during  demand for services in third party data centers weakened 
in addition  we recognized that there was limited demand for fully managed primary data services from enterprise customers 
during the quarter ended december   general economic conditions remained difficult and hosting service providers continued to experience significant financial difficulties 
as a result  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on selling software and services to large enterprise organizations 
this focus triggered an impairment review of long lived assets  primarily storage hardware assets used in delivering our fully managed storage services  within our s pop data centers that are located within third party hosting centers 
we calculated the expected net undiscounted cash flows of each s pop data center to determine which group of assets was impaired 
for those assets where impairment was present  a loss was recognized for the difference between the asset carrying values and fair market values 
we determined fair market value based on multiple quotes from third party data storage equipment resellers 
in conducting the impairment review  we separated assets in production assets to be held and used from idle assets assets to be disposed of 
assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of accounted for million and million  respectively  of the total million asset impairment charge 
in addition  as a result of our new focus on selling software and services to large enterprise organizations  we determined that certain assets and future obligations no longer matched the needs of our current enterprise customers or the future direction of the business 
therefore  we recognized a one time charge of million related to the following items fiber related assets and obligations million  the permanent impairment of strategic investments of privately held companies with businesses complementary to our fully managed primary storage services million  future commitments for office and s pop data center floor space million  future commitments for assets related to fully managed primary storage services million and employee termination costs and other charges million 
during the year ended december   we paid  related to these charges  and had million remaining in accrued expenses 
interest income interest income remained unchanged at million for and a larger average cash and investment balance  offset by lower overall money market and commercial paper interest rates in  caused interest income to remain unchanged 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase resulted from higher capital lease obligations throughout the year under which interest expense was incurred in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  including temporarily restricted cash equivalents  of million  investments of million and working capital of million 
as a result of our initiatives to develop version of our storos software as a stand alone product and to focus our sales and marketing efforts on large enterprise organizations  we have eliminated strategic investments in privately held companies with businesses complementary to our fully managed primary storage services  reduced future commitments for office and s pop data center floor space and reduced headcount 
we expect  however  that cash expenditures relating to research and development  including expenditures for software development  will continue to increase 
we have entered into a number of operating leases for our facilities  which expire from through we also lease certain data center infrastructure and equipment under capital leases 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt capital lease obligations    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations 
     net cash used in operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in our use of cash in and was primarily attributable to the operating loss generated by our investment in the growth of our business  which included an increase in personnel from nine at the end of to as of december   to as of december   offset by non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our use of cash in was also primarily attributable to the operating loss generated during the year 
although our operating loss in was greater than our operating loss in  our operating cash used was significantly less because our operating loss included million in asset impairment and other charges that were not represented by cash 
also  depreciation of fixed assets represented a larger percentage of our operating loss in finally  we reduced discretionary operating costs  mainly within cost of managed storage services and sales and marketing expenses  during the second half of while at the same time maintaining a consistent accounts receivable days sales outstanding 
however  million of the million asset impairment and other charges is represented by accrued expenses which will result in a use of cash in future periods 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in our cash used in investing activities in  and resulted primarily from our purchase of short term investments offset by maturities of such investments  the purchase of restricted cash equivalents in order to secure certain lease facilities  as well as additional procurement of capital equipment  principally equipment related to our managed storage services 
in addition  in  we made strategic investments in the preferred stock of private companies 
we did not make significant strategic investments in the preferred stock of private companies in our use of cash in was primarily attributable to the procurement of capital equipment used in the delivery of our managed storage services 
in addition  we redeemed more investments  which we used for operating purposes  than we purchased in as a result  our total use of cash from investing activities decreased in net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in in  our net cash used in financing activities totaled million 
in we raised million from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
in  we raised million from the sale of convertible preferred stock  million from our initial public offering and million from our follow on public offering completed in november our use of cash from financing activities in primarily related to the payment of capital lease obligations 
in the quarter ended december   we paid million to retire certain equipment lease obligations associated with storage assets before the end of their terms 
we did this to have more flexibility with these assets and because we were paying a fixed imputed interest rate that far exceeded our return on our cash 
we plan to spend at least million in in connection with additional early lease terminations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  lease terminations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to finance the expansion of our business with regard to new products or services or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncement in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
sfas  which is effective for all quarters in fiscal years beginning after december   establishes accounting and reporting standards for recognizing and measuring the impairment of long lived assets 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas  which is effective for all quarters in fiscal years beginning after december   supercedes apb opinion no

sfas  which is effective for all quarters in fiscal years beginning after june   supercedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and amends or supercedes a number of interpretations of apb no 
we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or other forward looking information 
we believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our stockholders 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control 
the factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language elsewhere in this form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations indicated by forward looking statements 
we may not successfully produce and sell our enterprise storage resource management software historically  our managed storage services have generated the majority of our revenues 
in january   we announced our intention to transition our business to focus on providing storage management software and services that meet the needs of large enterprise organizations and service providers and to decrease our sales and marketing of our managed storage services 
we are also in the process of preparing our existing software  which we currently use in providing our services  for licensing and delivery to customers as a stand alone product 
to be successful  this transition will require the successful development of new  independent versions of our software products 
these versions may not be available on schedule  or at all  and may not be accepted by customers 
this transition will also require changes in many aspects of our operations  including a modification of the function of our engineering department  our revenue recognition policies  our revenue forecasting  our profitability metrics  how we contract with our customers  how we provide support to our customers  how we market and sell our products and services  how we train our sales force  how we utilize third party sales channels  and how we compensate our sales force 
if this transition is not successful  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history due to the changing nature of our business  our limited operating history and the emerging nature of our markets  products and services  it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we commenced operations in october  we began offering our managed data storage services in may  and derived of our revenues in  of our revenues in  and of our revenues in from these services 
none of our revenues in was derived from the direct licensing of software products 
the enterprise storage resource management software and services markets are relatively new  highly competitive  and may not continue to grow or be sustainable 
potential customers may choose to purchase enterprise storage resource management software and services from a competitor or may choose to develop the software or services themselves 
it is possible that our software and services may never achieve significant market acceptance 
if these markets do not mature  or develop more slowly than we expect  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be seriously harmed 
we have incurred losses in each quarter since our inception 
we experienced net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot be certain that our revenues will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we believe that we will continue to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
we will need to generate higher revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability 
if our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly  or if our operating or capital expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be further reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our stock price has been volatile and could result in substantial losses of investors the market for technology stock has been extremely volatile 
the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock in the public market to fluctuate significantly 
the addition or departure of key personnel  
variations in our quarterly operating results  
announcements by us or our competitors of the gain or loss of significant contracts  new products or service offerings or enhancements  mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or capital commitments  
changes in earnings estimates by analysts  
our sales of common stock or other securities in the future  
changes in market valuations of technology companies  and 
fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes 
our market is highly competitive  and our competition includes established storage hardware and software vendors and service providers against whom we may not be able to compete successfully the market in which we operate is highly competitive and is marked by rapid and substantial technological change  the emergence of new competitive companies  products  services and evolving technical standards 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and services and continue to enhance our existing products and services 
we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to develop new products or services or new releases or versions that meet the needs of customers 
in addition  the introduction of new products and services  or new versions of existing products  may not meet with customer acceptance or may be delayed 
we currently face competition from hardware and software vendors whose products compete with our software products and who also provide consulting and related services that compete with our services 
many of these vendors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
many of these vendors also have more extensive customer bases  broader customer relationships and broader industry alliances than us  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
we also face competition from other providers of storage services and may face competition from new entrants to the data storage market 
increased competition from any of these sources could result in a loss of customers and market share 
our current and future competitors could introduce products and services with superior features and functionality  and could bundle their services and software with other products in order to compete 
additionally  price competition  particularly from competitors with greater resources  could require us to reduce the prices for our services and software 
any of these results could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
we might experience significant defects in our products in the past  we have utilized our software to manage the delivery of our services to our customers 
however  we have never sold our software to customers as independent products  and we may not be successful in developing our software as independent products 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we might experience significant errors or failures in our products  or they might not work with other hardware or software as expected  which could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products  or which could adversely affect market acceptance or our products 
our products can be used to manage data critical to organizations 
if we were to experience significant delays in the release of new products or new versions of products  or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for service or warranty costs and claims  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
certain software is licensed from third parties some of our products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future or on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays  delays in the development of future products or enhancements of existing products  or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we rely on enterprise transactions we market our services and intend to market our products to large enterprise customers 
however  we may not successfully be able to market and sell our software or services to such customers 
such failure could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our operating results are sensitive to the timing of such orders 
such orders are difficult to manage and predict  because 
the sales cycle is typically lengthy  generally lasting six to twelve months  and varies substantially from transaction to transaction  
enterprise license transactions often include multiple elements such as product licenses and service and support  
recognition of revenue from enterprise license transactions may vary from transaction to transaction  
they typically involve significant technical evaluation and commitment of resources  and 
customers internal procedures frequently cause delays in orders 
such internal procedures include approval of capital expenditures  implementation of new technologies within their networks  and testing new technologies that affect key operations 
many of the large organizations that we target as customers have lowered their rate of spending on enterprise software 
due to the large size of enterprise transactions  if orders forecasted for a specific transaction for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter may be seriously harmed 
we may rely on indirect sales channels as we develop and market our software products  we may rely on distributors  systems integrators  other software makers  and hardware vendors for the marketing and distribution of our products 
agreements with such resellers may not be exclusive and may be terminable by either party without cause 
these resellers might also market products that are competitive with ours 
the development of business relationships with resellers will require a significant amount of resources 
any failure of these reseller arrangements  or any failure to develop such reseller arrangements  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and operating results 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us  and additional suits may be filed  which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which may harm our business we and several of our officers are named as defendants in a purported class action complaint that has been filed on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock between june  and december  this complaint alleges violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of  each as amended 
this complaint primarily alleges that there was undisclosed compensation received by our underwriters from purchasers of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this matter 
any conclusion of this matter in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operation 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
we may also be subject to other class action litigation in the future 
any such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general and could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will be unsuccessful if we are unable to develop and protect our proprietary technology a key component of our growth strategy is to further develop our proprietary software 
our continued expansion and development of our operations will depend on  among other things  our ability to produce software that can be sold as products independent of our services  as well as to develop new products 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we do not have any significant issued patents and have filed only a limited number of patent applications with respect to our data storage software and services 
we cannot be certain that our current patent applications or any future application will be granted  that any future patent will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that rights granted under any patent issued to us will afford us a competitive advantage 
our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions 
the laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar information or technology 
our inability to continue to expand our services or to develop and adequately protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and our ability to compete effectively 
any failure of our products and services could lead to significant costs  service disruptions and data loss  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business and reputation to be successful  we must provide our customers with secure  efficient and reliable enterprise storage resource management software and managed data storage services 
to meet these customer requirements  we must protect our software and services against failure caused by occurrences such as 
product error  
design flaws  
human error  
physical or electronic security breaches  
fire  earthquake  flood and other disasters  
power loss  and 
sabotage  vandalism and terrorism 
the failure of our software to operate as we warrant or the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at one or more of our s pop data centers could result in lack of performance  service interruptions  significant damage to equipment or loss or unavailability of customer data  which could adversely affect our reputation  our ability to attract new customers and the value of our stock 
we may also be subject to legal actions by our customers 
any significant product errors or design flaws or any widespread loss of services would slow the adoption of our products and services and cause damage to our reputation  which would seriously harm our business 
our revenues will not continue to grow  our costs will increase  and our reputation will be damaged if we are not able to deliver our products and services in accordance with our contracts with our customers because our services contracts provide customers credits against a portion of their monthly service fees if our managed data storage services do not achieve specified performance levels of data availability  successfully completed back ups and data security  we will lose revenues and may experience a decrease in customer satisfaction if our services and software do not perform as we expect 
our failure to satisfy our customers could damage our reputation  significantly reduce demand for our services  and cause us to receive lower fees than expected and incur unforeseen costs to remedy our shortfalls 
quarterly and annual operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  which may cause our stock price to decline and could cause long term harm to our business quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  which in turn could adversely affect our revenue  profitability or cash flow in the future and could cause serious harm to our business 
these factors include 
our success at marketing and selling our software and services  and customers reactions to our new software products  
success in expanding and adapting our sales and marketing programs  
financial condition of our customers and customers demand for and implementation of our products and services  
length of sales cycle  
general economic conditions  
price and product competition  
ability to introduce new or enhanced products and services  
market acceptance of our or our competitors new products and services  
ability to control costs  
new hardware and software technologies  
size and timing of licensing and services transactions  
ability to retain qualified personnel  
changes in pricing policies  
quality control of our products and services  
acquisition costs or other non recurring charges in connection with the acquisition of companies  products or technologies  
acts of terrorism and acts of war  
temporary shortages or interruptions in supply of storage hardware and software  and 
natural disasters in the geographic markets in which we operate 
if any of our business relationships with hosting service providers  hardware and software vendors and other service providers and suppliers terminate or do not develop  our revenues could be adversely affected we have formed business relationships  both formally and informally  with various hosting service providers  hardware and software vendors and other service providers and suppliers for joint marketing and sales activities 
we may also need to develop relationships with third party hardware and software vendors to sell our software products 
if we are unable to develop or maintain such relationships  our potential future software revenues could be adversely affected 
for example  exodus communications  inc exodus  with whom we had a joint marketing and services agreement  filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on september  under the terms of our agreement with exodus  we provide services to customers inside exodus data centers  and exodus generally invoices the customers for these services 
on february   exodus completed the sale of a substantial part of its business to cable wireless plc and digital island  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cable wireless 
as part of this acquisition  cable wireless has assumed the joint marketing and services agreement  and we intend to continue to provide services to customers under that agreement 
the closing of the acquisition by cable wireless also triggered exodus obligation to pay us for pre bankruptcy petition services that had previously been unpaid as a result of exodus bankruptcy filing  and we have received such payment in full 
as a result of the change of ownership from exodus to cable wireless  some of these customers may move their business to data center hosting companies with whom we do not have a relationship 
in addition  these customers may otherwise cease using our services  and cable wireless may otherwise not fulfill its obligations under our agreement with exodus  including the failure of certain exodus subsidiaries to fulfill obligations under the agreement 
if our relationship with cable wireless is terminated  or if we are otherwise unable to collect revenue from cable wireless  its subsidiaries  or from these customers  our business and results of operations would be substantially harmed 
our software and services may become obsolete if we do not respond rapidly to technological and market changes the data storage software and managed data storage services markets are and will continue to be characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
if competitors introduce products  services or technologies that are better than ours or that gain greater market acceptance  or if new industry standards emerge  our software and services may become obsolete  which would materially harm our business and results of operations 
in developing our software and services  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions about the standards that our customers and competitors may adopt 
if the standards adopted are different from those that we may now or in the future promote or support  market acceptance of our software and services may be significantly reduced or delayed  and our business will be harmed 
in addition  the introduction of products or services incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products and services obsolete 
the development of new or enhanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we currently plan to introduce and market several potential new products in the next twelve months 
some of our competitors currently offer certain of these potential new products or products similar to these potential new products 
such potential new products are subject to significant technical risks 
we may fail to introduce such potential new products on a timely basis or at all 
if potential new products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be seriously harmed 
we may experience design  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new services or enhancements to our existing services 
our failure to anticipate and meet changing customer requirements could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing necessary to grow our business as we grow our business  we may need additional financing 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms 
additionally  holders of any future debt instruments may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock  and any future issuance of common stock would result in dilution of existing stockholders equity interests 
our revenues could decline if our customers do not renew our services or if the rates we charge for services are reduced we provide our managed data storage services through service level agreements with our customers 
we have little historical information with which to forecast future demand for our services from our existing customer base after existing contracts expire 
if our customers elect not to renew our services  our revenues will be reduced and our business and financial results may suffer 
as the data storage hardware  software and services market continues to experience increased competition and price pressure  we will continue to experience pressure to decrease the fees for our services  which could adversely affect our revenues and our gross margin 
a portion of our current customers are internet based businesses that may not pay us for our services on a timely basis and that may not succeed over the long term approximately of our revenues recognized in were derived from customers that are internet based businesses  and a portion of our future managed storage services revenues will be derived from this customer base 
the unproven business models of some of these customers make their continued financial viability uncertain 
given the short operating history and emerging nature of many of these businesses  some of our customers have encountered financial difficulties and failed to pay for our services or substantially delayed payment and there is a risk that more of these customers will encounter similar difficulties 
the failure of any of our customers to pay our fees on a timely basis or to continue to purchase our services in accordance with their contractual commitments could adversely affect our revenue collection periods  revenues and other financial results 
provisions of our charter documents may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  by laws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is staggered in three classes  so that only a portion of the directors may be replaced at any annual meeting 
our by laws limit the persons authorized to call special meetings of stockholders and require advance notice for stockholders to submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
additionally  our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval that could have the effect not only of delaying or preventing an acquisition  but also of adversely affecting the price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk nearly all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars and are primarily from customers located in the united states 
although we have s pop data centers and sales offices located outside the united states  revenues from international customers to date have not been significant 
we incur costs for our overseas offices in the local currency of those offices for staffing  rent  telecommunications and other services 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
although currency fluctuations are currently not a material risk to our operating results  we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations in the future 
we do not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market risk on our investments because substantially all of our investments are in fixed rate  short term securities 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due to the fixed rate  short term nature of our investment portfolio
