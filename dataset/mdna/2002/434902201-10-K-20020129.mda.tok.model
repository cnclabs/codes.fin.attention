general we are a multi store dealership chain that sells  finances and services rvs  boats and other recreation vehicles 
we currently have retail locations  although our clermont  florida dealership was damaged by fire in april and is still being reconstructed 
we expect the reconstruction to be complete during the second quarter of fiscal our growth depends primarily on our ability to obtain the necessary capital to support our operations and allow us to successfully execute our business plan 
key elements of our business plan include opening new stores  increasing the performance of our existing locations  and  growing through selective acquisitions in limited circumstances 
our inability to meet our projected growth potential will adversely impact our business 
our primary focus in fiscal was on acquiring well established rv and marine dealerships with strong leadership roles in key geographic markets with strong demographics 
we then worked to improve their performance and profitability by implementing our operating strategies 
in fiscal  our primary strategy focused on integrating the acquired dealerships into our corporate structure  reducing our inventory turnover rates to comply with dollar limits imposed by our primary floor plan lender  reducing expenditures and closing unprofitable locations 
our performance in fiscal reflects a reevaluation of our business from all aspects 
we believe that structuring our business to fit within the limitations of our capital resources will position us to perform at higher levels if the demand for recreational products increases at the anticipated rate 
we intend to add new dealerships by leasing suitable property in key geographic markets and through co location opportunities with strategic partners  but only if we have sufficient working capital to sustain expansion 
we will also consider acquisition opportunities within our existing markets if we believe it will result in operating and marketing efficiencies and that the acquisition will immediately add profits to operations 
while we do not anticipate closing any of our current dealerships  we intend to closely monitor the performance of all locations and close any that are unprofitable or whose performance does not justify continued operations 
all of our acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
as a result  we have not included in our financial statements the results of operations of the acquired companies prior to the dates we acquired them 
any goodwill of an acquisition is amortized over a year period 
our growth also depends on same store growth and maintaining sufficient working capital to operate each store efficiently 
we have experienced a downturn in sales for the last sixteen months 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was a downturn in our sales 
we believe that the industry and our markets are poised for recovery and continued increased sales 
we expect our same store sales growth to follow these industry trends based on the number of baby boomers  our target demographic group  reaching their peak earnings and vacation years during that period 
we also believe there is a renewed sense of national pride and an increased desire to experience the geographic diversity of the united states 
the us census bureau confirms the projected growth of the baby boomers population segment 
we believe this group of buyers and other demographic groups will increasingly use recreational products as a travel alternative and to enhance the quality of their lives 
however  these trends may not produce the increased sales that we expect 
we launched a national branding strategy in december to consolidate and rebrand the various operating names of our subsidiaries under the trade name recreation usa 
we believe the new trade name better reflects our corporate identity and solidifies our acquisitions under a single  recognizable brand that will be memorable with customers 
however  we believe there is a greater potential to capitalize on the brand identity 
we intend to evaluate strategies aimed at achieving a greater value with our geographic market diversity 
implementing these strategies depends on the continued availability of cash to advertise and promote our brand 
effective november   we changed our revenue recognition policy related to commissions we earn for placing retail financing contracts with indirect lending institutions in connection with customer vehicle and marine purchases and customer purchases of credit life insurance products to defer these commissions until the chargeback period has lapsed 
this change was made in accordance with the implementation of the us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the effect of this change is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the year ended october  the net effect reflects the deferral as of november  of approximately million of revenue net of chargebacks previously recognized 
we recognized the revenue included in the cumulative effect adjustment during the year ended october  the effects of this change in accounting principle on net loss and net loss per share for the year ended october  were decreases of approximately  and per share  respectively 
results of operations we have summarized for the periods presented  certain selected income statement data as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  total revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income loss from operations interest expense  net gain loss on the sale of fixed assets loss on debt conversion gain on insurance recovery income tax provision benefit net income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect on prior years as of november  related to the implementation of sab net income loss number of stores at end of period results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal sales and service revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this decrease  million was attributable to a decrease in same store sales  partially offset by the effect of acquired stores 
used vehicle sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year used vehicle sales result in approximately higher gross profits than new units on average 
new rv and marine product sales decreased in fiscal to million  or of total rv and marine product sales  from million  or of total rv and marine product sales in fiscal although new vehicle sales may have been adversely affected by the reduction in available inventory  management believes that its prior inventory levels were principally overstocked 
the decline in comparable store sales was primarily the result of the following three factors internal management initiatives 
management focused on reducing aged and overstocked inventory by reducing selling prices  lowering inventory at all locations to increase inventory turnover and restocking inventory based on local market demand at each dealership 
we also focused on changing our product mix to include less expensive new models  and more used rvs  which have a higher gross profit 
we believe that lower priced used vehicles are more desirable in a weak economy characterized by declining consumer confidence 
in addition  in the last days of fiscal year  we focused on store performance by closing dealerships we believed were not performing at levels sufficient to justify their continued operation 
we also closed dealerships in markets where we had multiple locations 
we expect to offset most of the loss of revenue from the closed locations with increased revenue and profits from stores remaining in the same general market of each closed dealership 
external market conditions 
we believe that declining consumer confidence and the slower economic environment played a significant role in the overall decrease in recreation vehicle and marine product revenue for fiscal year however  studies show that the long term outlook for rv sales continues to appear favorable 
based on research conducted for the rvia in fall  we believe lower gas prices  lower interest rates and the desire for greater flexibility and control over travel plans in the post september travel climate will increase the demand for our products 
demographic studies reflect continued growth in the recreational vehicle prime target market for the next years 
we intend to continue responding to market demand by emphasizing lower priced vehicles  and offering value added service and warranty programs while reducing costs 
financial constraints 
our ability to maintain what we believe is a desirable mix between new and used products has been hampered by reductions in our available floor plan credit line and the time required to sell aged inventory  which is not eligible for floor plan funding  and overstocked inventory in a weak market 
in addition  throughout fiscal year  we have had insufficient capital to satisfy all of our working capital requirements 
this dramatically limits our ability to meet our business objectives and fully exploit our markets in any economic environment 
parts and services revenue increased million  or  to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal while same store sales decreased million  or  this decrease was offset by acquired or newly opened stores 
although there was a downturn in our overall business and we were constrained by our limited working capital  we emphasized our parts and service business which contributed positively to our performance 
net revenue from finance and insurance products and other sources decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
of this decrease  million was attributable to a decrease in same store sales partially offset by net revenue generated from acquired or newly opened stores 
the overall decrease in fiscal is directly related to our decrease in new and used rv and marine product sales 
effective november   we changed our revenue recognition policy by adopting sab  which defers recognizing revenue on commissions received from placing indirect retail installment contracts with indirect lenders and fees generated from the sale of credit life insurance 
the cumulative adjustment required to record the accounting change is separately recorded as a charge before net income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the current year net effect of this change in the revenue recorded from finance and insurance products was additional revenue of million 
total gross profit decreased million  or in fiscal from million in  primarily due to a decrease in same store gross profit  partially offset by gross profit from the newly acquired dealerships in fiscal the decrease in actual dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily related to a reduction in overstocked and aged inventory which we accomplished by reducing retail prices to increase sales of aged units and through additional inventory reserves based on inventory aging  reassessment of wholesale market value and salability  historical sales activity and the condition of the merchandise as of october  these efforts resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
in addition to marking down inventory  which we believe created value for our customers  we provided incentives to our sales force to achieve our inventory objectives 
although these initiatives impacted gross profit  we successfully reduced new and used rv and marine product inventories by million  or 
parts and services gross profit decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal same store gross profit decreased million  or  partially offset by the effect of the acquired stores 
in addition  all parts and accessory inventory was reviewed and valued based on sales history  aging  condition of merchandise and applicability to the markets we service 
as a result  our reserve for obsolescence increased by million in fiscal net revenue from finance and insurance and other products contributed of total gross profit in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or approximately million  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal on a same store basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal acquisitions and new store openings represent an additional expense of million in fiscal all other expenses were million 
in fiscal  we also recorded an expense of million for common stock issued to a financial consultant as compensation for services 
personnel related expenses remained essentially unchanged  and represented of expenses in fiscal  compared to in fiscal total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to from due to decreased revenue and increased charges incurred in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing impaired goodwill for two closed stores 
we concluded that operating one larger dealership in a geographic market  rather than three smaller dealerships in the same market  would improve performance in that market  and positively impact the performance of our dealerships in surrounding markets 
loss from operations in fiscal was million  approximately million more than the fiscal loss from operations 
this was primarily the result of the activities described above 
interest expense decreased to to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reductions in floor plan financing as a result of decreased inventory levels  despite an increase in our floor plan interest rates 
we had losses from the sales of assets of million compared to a slight gain in fiscal in fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million from an insurance recovery on the clermont  florida property damaged in a fire 
debt conversion expense of million was charged in fiscal in connection with the conversion of seller notes into shares of our common stock 
seller notes with a principal balance of approximately million were converted into  shares of common stock valued at approximately million  or million less than the carrying value of the debt 
since the terms of the conversion were the result of a modification of the original conversion terms that would have called for share issuance at a fixed price of per share  or  shares  we were required under sfas no 
 induced conversions of convertible debt  to record this non cash expense charge equal to the fair value of the incremental shares  issued 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal most all current year tax benefits created from loss carrybacks to income years were offset by a valuation allowance established to reduce previously recognized deferred tax assets due to uncertainty about their realization 
see note to the financial statements 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
we received a tax refund of approximately million in fiscal for a carry back of net operating loss 
in fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the change in our revenue recognition policy from adopting sab  which defers recognizing revenue on commissions received from placing indirect retail installment contracts with indirect lenders and fees generated from the sale of credit life insurance 
the current year effect of this change is reflected in operating income 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal sales and service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the newly acquired dealerships in fiscal of the increase  million  or  was from the newly acquired county line and little valley dealerships 
in spite of the negative impact of higher interest rates  increasing fuel prices and a declining stock market on customer traffic starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we were able to increase comparable store stores owned both periods sales by  or million 
we continue to respond to these market conditions with a concentrated focus on aggressive promotions  improved product mix  improved stocking levels  and improved service 
on a pro forma comparable basis all stores for the comparable periods sales and service revenue decreased by approximately  or 
we expect revenue to increase significantly in fiscal  primarily due to our expansion 
we expect our same store sales to fluctuate from the impact of changes in competition within each market we operate  movement in interest rates  general market conditions in the areas in which our stores are located  our acquisition of new dealerships in the same general market of our existing dealerships  and the risk factors set forth below 
coming off a record setting  rv industry analysts predicted that sales would increase to during  yet industry shipments for the first months of the year show the entire sector was down about percent 
motorhomes  which led sales growth during  declined nearly percent 
higher interest rates  increasing fuel prices and a declining stock market dampened consumer confidence in although we expect our existing stores to have sales growth and to remain profitable  we expect most of our sales growth to come from newly added store locations 
however  we may not be able to continue to grow or purchase new store locations at a sufficiently rapid pace or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in  primarily due to gross profit from the newly acquired dealerships in fiscal gross margin decreased to from  primarily as a result of our decision to sell inventory at a lower cost in order to remain competitive 
this decrease was offset by increased margins in parts and services  which increased to from 
this was the result of our strategy to become the rv industry s first national brand 
on a pro forma comparable basis all stores for comparable periods  total gross profit decreased by million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to million in sg a for the newly acquired dealerships 
approximately million of the increase was due to expenses associated with building an infrastructure for our current and future expansion  acquisition related expenses and improving stockholder communications 
expenses to promote the new trade name recreation usa and the relocation of two dealerships also impacted sg a 
we expect the infrastructure building and the acquisition related types of expense to continue but these expenses will have a significantly lower impact in the future on total sg a as revenue from acquisitions increases and the integration of acquired businesses are completed 
loss from operations in fiscal was  this was million less than the million income from operations earned in fiscal this was primarily the result of the activities described above  including costs associated with expanding our infrastructure  acquisition related expenses and improving stockholder communications 
operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to from 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased inventory levels  resulting from acquired dealerships  accounting for approximately of the total increase 
higher interest rates on floor plan balances  accounted for of the increase  was for interest on acquisition related debt  and was for mortgage interest 
the federal and state income tax benefit rate was in fiscal compared to a tax rate of in fiscal the combined benefit rate varies from the statutory rate due to increased non deductible expenses for tax  primarily goodwill 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for components of the income taxes and the reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the federal statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily to support operations  including non floored inventory for resale 
historically we have met our cash needs with cash on hand or occasional borrowings from former affiliates of our directors or officers  and other non affiliated third parties  in the form of bridge financing 
we intend to limit our use of this source of funding in the future because the terms and expense of this type of short term lending do not fit within our financing strategy 
our new and used inventory are financed by floor plan credit facilities  which were significantly reduced in fiscal and are currently being renegotiated 
cash flows from operations 
during the fiscal year ended october   our cash flows decreased primarily due to a million net loss 
cash of million was used during the fiscal year to repay our floor plan lenders 
total inventory was reduced million 
repayments to general suppliers and vendors have been extended with accounts payable increasing million 
we also received million in cash for an income tax refund that resulted from our net operating loss carry back 
other current asset balance sheet accounts were reduced offsetting the reduction in cash flow from the net operating loss 
cash flows from investing 
investing activities used net cash of million as compared to million in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease resulted from changing our business strategy in fiscal from growth through acquisition to our current focus on integrating the acquired dealerships  reducing inventories and closing unprofitable locations 
in fiscal  we used million to purchase dealerships  and million to purchase property  plant and equipment  primarily for the county line and little valley dealerships 
the prior year also included a sale and leaseback transaction that provided million in cash 
capital expenditures for property and equipment are expected to be less than  in fiscal in fiscal year  we invested million in restricted cash to support our floor plan agreement with our primary lender and million to support other obligations 
cash flows from financing 
financing activities provided net cash of million as compared to million in fiscal we raised million in fiscal through additional short term bridge loans  some of which were repaid in and others with repayment terms that have recently been renegotiated 
in fiscal  we received million from a real property mortgage on our spartanburg  south carolina dealership and million of notes payable and used million to retire notes payable 
net use of cash from all activities was million  which reduced cash and cash equivalents to million from million the prior year 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million from million the prior year  primarily due to the net operating loss  an increase in accounts payable  deferral of revenue recognition and a reduction in inventory at reduced margins 
capital expenditures 
generally  all major capital projects are discretionary in nature and no material commitments currently exist 
any capital expenditures will be funded from additional debt or equity sources 
principal long term commitments 
as of october   our principal long term commitments consist of operating leases and notes payable 
our recovery and growth strategies depend upon obtaining adequate financing to cover operational needs and ultimately establish additional rv and marine dealerships 
we finance substantially all new and used inventories through floor plan financing arrangements with one primary and several smaller lenders 
these financing agreements generally require that substantially all new and used vehicles and marine products held in inventory be pledged as collateral 
advances become due upon sale of the related vehicle or marine product or as the related item ages beyond the allowable finance period 
in march  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with our primary floor plan lender that required the following the reduction of available credit to a maximum of  by may  the maintenance of certain financial covenants including tangible net worth and working capital and debt to tangible net worth ratios  and collateral of million in the form of a certificate of deposit to be pledged by march  in april  we completed further negotiations with our primary lender to amend several of the terms of the march amended and restated loan and security agreement 
the first amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement reduced the certificate of deposit pledge to million and added collateral consisting of mortgages on all of our unencumbered real estate 
the million certificate of deposit was established in july and is classified as restricted cash at october  the interest rate for advances on eligible new and used inventory was at prime plus and  respectively 
the first amendment  which expired october   waived our failure to meet the financial covenants through april  we did not meet the financial covenants through october   and are currently negotiating with our primary floor plan lender to renew the floor plan financing arrangement 
we executed a forbearance and amendment to the expired agreement that was effective through january  while negotiations continued 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the lender is now evaluating financial projections and other information we provided  as requested 
on the basis of that evaluation  the lender will decide whether to continue the floor plan on the same terms as the expired agreement  demand repayment of the unpaid balance or enter into a new agreement with different terms 
the impact of the lender s decision on our business depends on which decision it ultimately reaches 
for example  if the lender demands immediate repayment  we will not be able to stock sufficient rv and marine inventory to sustain our business 
we do not believe the lender will take this action  but we cannot be sure that the terms of a new arrangement would be more favorable than those under the expired agreement 
we have also negotiated an arrangement with another floor plan provider that requested payment of the unpaid balance under the floor plan agreement in late fiscal because of our poor performance and because it was no longer providing floor plan financing to rv dealers 
we are currently paying off the outstanding balance  which was  at october   through the sale of units included in the floor plan and have done so throughout fiscal we anticipate repaying past due amounts on a mutually agreed schedule concluding in june after we raise additional capital  we intend to continue negotiating with our major floor plan lender to increase the amount of floor plan financing available to us 
this will allow additional dealerships to be included under our major floor plan agreement 
however  we may not be able to obtain sufficient alternative floor plan financing to meet our business plan requirements 
going concern 
as discussed  there is uncertainty regarding the outcome of our negotiations with our primary floor plan lender and we may not be able to obtain sufficient alternative floor plan financing to meet our business needs in fiscal year we have also incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and incurred net cash outflows from operations of approximately million and million  respectively 
these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
while management believes that operating performance will improve in fiscal year  we may require additional funding to cover operating deficits 
management further believes that additional financing will be made available to support the our liquidity requirements and that certain costs and expenditures could be reduced further should any needed additional funding not be available 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or continue to restrain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve its intended business objectives 
see note summary of significant accounting policies 
inflation 
if inflation occurs in the general economy  the cost of our inventory and could increase and interest rates paid by us or our customers could increase 
we believe that increases in the cost of new rvs and marine products purchased from our manufacturers can generally be passed on to consumers  although there may be a lag in our ability to pass such increases on to our customers 
historically  increases in operating costs are passed on to the consumer when the market allows 
we believe that our business has not been significantly affected by past inflation  despite increased chassis and manufacturer conversion costs 
however  significant increases in interest rates may make rvs less affordable to many potential purchasers 
this could materially and adversely affect purchases of rvs generally and our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against that new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
sfas is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted in certain circumstances 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
sfas is effective for financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect sfas to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issues statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  management is still analyzing the potential impacts of this pronouncement 
recent events private placement of series a preferred stock in january  we entered into a securities purchase agreement under which we agreed to sell up to units of securities  in a private placement to accredited investors 
each unit consists of shares of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
the purchase price is  per unit for total proceeds of million if all the units are sold 
the warrants are exercisable for five years at an exercise price of per share  but only if we receive the stockholder approval required under the applicable nasdaq rules 
the series a preferred stock is divided into two sub series designated sub series a and sub series a  which are identical  except that only the sub series a will be convertible into shares of common stock and have voting rights until we obtain the stockholder approval required to comply with nasdaq marketplace rates and the number of shares of common stock into which the sub series a preferred stock is initially convertible is  shares  which represents approximately of our outstanding stock at december  at each closing  purchasers will receive a pro rata number of shares of sub series a preferred stock and sub series a preferred stock based on the maximum  shares being offered 
if all of the series a shares offered are not purchased by the anticipated final closing date of january   the purchasers will be entitled to exchange their shares of sub series a preferred stock for shares of sub series a preferred stock on a pro rata basis until the maximum number of shares of sub series a convertible preferred stock are issued 
as of january   we had sold  and  shares of sub series a and sub series a  respectively  and granted warrants for the purchase of  shares of common stock for total proceeds of million 
we received preliminary stockholder approval from a majority of our stockholders and we expect to receive formal stockholder approval before february  if we obtain the required stockholder approval  the series a preferred stock will be convertible at any time at the holder s option  at the then applicable conversion rate  adjusted for certain events including the issuance of common stock for consideration less than the conversion price then in effect 
each share of series a preferred stock will initially be convertible into shares of common stock if we obtain the necessary stockholder approval 
dividends of per year accrue daily and are payable quarterly on march  june  september and december of each year 
dividends accumulate and compound quarterly if not paid in cash on the dividend payment date 
if we are in default under the terms of the series a preferred securities purchase agreement  the dividend rate will increase to per year 
the series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference of of the issuance price 
upon a liquidation or sale  holders of the series a preferred stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference payment of the original issuance price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
if any shares of the series a preferred stock are still outstanding on december   we must redeem those shares at the issuance price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends  if funds are legally available to do so 
we are also required to redeem the series a preferred stock at the liquidation preference price upon a consolidation  merger or reorganization  the sale of substantially all of our assets  or consummation of a purchase  exchange or tender offer for more than of our common stock 
the holders of the series a preferred stock may also require us to redeem their shares at the liquidation preference price if our common stock is not listed on the nasdaq  american stock exchange or the new york stock exchange for business days during any month period  if we provide notice to any holder that we do not intend to comply with the conversion request  or if we are in default under the securities agreement and do not cure the default 
on the date of issuance  through january   the estimated fair market value of our common stock exceeded the conversion price of the series a preferred stock 
this resulted in a deemed dividend of approximately million 
series b preferred on december   we received  as the first tranche payment of a proposed investment in all shares of our series b preferred stock 
the terms are subject to negotiation and completion of definitive documentation and all authorizations required under applicable law 
bridge financing in january  we agreed to convert into common stock  at a per share conversion price to be determined  approximately  of the unpaid balance plus accrued and unpaid interest on the  bridge note and the  demand note from an affiliate of a former director  and a former officer and director of ours see note other debt bridge financing and note related party transactions 
the remaining balance of approximately  was assigned by the noteholders to our chief executive officer in settlement of non company obligations between the parties 
the chief executive officer agreed to eliminate the interest charge and to structure a repayment schedule to fit within our cash flow parameters 
in january  we agreed to restructure the  bridge note received in august see note other debt bridge financing by converting  into common stock  at a per share conversion price to be determined 
payment of the remaining  balance plus accrued interest is due no later than december  in addition  the holder agreed to release a junior security interest in our tampa  florida and las cruces  new mexico properties 
floor plan financing on january   we entered into a forbearance agreement with our primary floor plan lender to amend and extend the floor plan financing agreement to january  see note floor plan contracts 
during the forbearance period  holiday agreed to additional terms  which allow for the continuation of the financing while negotiations continue 
our non compliance with the financial covenants has not been waived during the forbearance period 
there are no assurances that we will reach agreeable terms with our primary floor plan lender or obtain sufficient alternative floor plan financing see note summary of significant accounting policies 
sale of tampa property on january   we entered into an agreement to sell our tampa  florida facility for  and a net book value at october  of  the purchaser has a day inspection period beginning on that date to perform standard due diligence inspections of the property and to obtain the necessary financing to complete the purchase 
the purchaser may opt out of the contract with a full refund of the initial  deposit during the day inspection period 
beginning on the day the inspection period ends  the purchaser has days to close the purchase or forfeit the deposit 
since the property is pledged as collateral and secured by a first mortgage with our primary floor plan lender  all proceeds will be remitted to the lender for application to the outstanding floor plan obligation or held as additional restricted cash 
risk factors our independent certified public accountants doubt our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements for the years ended october  and were audited by our independent certified public accountants 
their report states that the financial statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern although we incurred significant net losses in fiscal and and have net cash outflows from operations that may require additional funding  which we may not be able to obtain 
these circumstances raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our primary floor plan financing agreement has expired and our ability to continue as a going concern depends on obtaining sufficient floor plan financing 
if we do not have adequate floor plan financing  we will not be able to meet our business objectives and we will not generate the cash flow necessary to sustain our operations 
the floor plan financing arrangement with our primary lender was terminated in january the new agreement  which had a lower borrowing limit and higher interest rates  expired in november we recently negotiated a forbearance arrangement 
under that arrangement  our lender continued to provide funding through january  the lender is currently evaluating the pro forma financials and cash flow analysis provided by us  among other things  to determine whether to extend our current forbearance arrangement  enter into a new lending agreement or to demand repayment of the outstanding unpaid balance 
another provider is no longer providing floor plan financing to recreation vehicle dealers 
if we do not successfully negotiate an extension to our expired floor plan  comply with all of its terms  or our other floor plan financing sources do not provide adequate funding  we may have to reduce our inventory  close or sell retail stores  sell real estate or seek bankruptcy protection 
the lack of sufficient floor plan financing  in addition to significant net losses  raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional financing 
our future capital requirements will depend upon the size  timing and structure of future acquisitions or strategic partnerships and our available working capital 
our large amount of indebtedness could adversely affect our business because much of our cash flow from operations may be needed to meet our debt obligations and would not be available for other uses 
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or other reasons may be limited 
we are vulnerable to further downturns in our operating results  or in economic conditions or if interest rates increase 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements  we will need to refinance or obtain additional financing or dispose of assets 
in addition  our credit arrangements generally contain financial and operational covenants and other restrictions with which we must comply 
our failure to comply with financial covenants may prevent us from obtaining adequate financing that we need 
we were required to replace our floor plan financing arrangement in january this reduced our prior borrowing levels  increased our financing costs and added other financial covenants 
we renegotiated some of the terms of the new arrangement in march although as part of that renegotiation the lender waived our failure to comply with new financial covenants as of april   we were not able to meet those covenants in and we may not meet those covenants in the future 
the reduced financing line also forced us to seek other sources of floor plan financing 
our failure to comply with required financial and other covenants or to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects since we rely on such financing to obtain the inventory levels necessary to support our business plan 
adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
the units we recently sold in a private placement may be convertible into a number of shares of common stock that will substantially dilute our current stockholders 
in january  we entered into a securities purchase agreement under which we agreed to sell up to units for a total purchase price of million 
each unit consists of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock 
if we obtain the stockholder approval required under nasdaq marketplace rules and  each share of series a preferred stock will be convertible into shares of common stock for a conversion price of per share and each warrant will be exercisable for five years for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we believe the offering will be fully subscribed in which case the preferred stock will be convertible into seven million shares of common stock and the warrants will be exercisable for  shares of common stock after we receive stockholder approval 
the potential dilutive effect to our current stockholders could have a negative impact on our earnings per share 
the series a preferred stock has anti dilution provisions that could result in further dilution to our current stockholders 
if we issue shares of stock in the future below the conversion price of the series a preferred stock  we will be required to issue additional shares to the holders of series a preferred 
we must also issue additional shares to the holders of the series a preferred stock if we sell shares in the future below the market price of our common stock 
this would result in further dilution to our current stockholders with a further negative impact on our earnings per share 
the conversion price of the series a preferred stock was below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of sale 
this resulted in a deemed dividend of approximately the amount of funds raised which will have a negative effect on our earnings per share 
if we do not receive the stockholder approval required by nasdaq  the holders of the series a preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares at a premium 
the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to a liquidation preference payment equal to of the purchase price if we do not obtain the required approval 
if this occurs  we would have to find additional sources of financing to sustain our operations 
our sales could decline if consumers buy fewer leisure items due to general economic conditions or interest rate increases 
our sales are affected by general economic conditions  including consumer confidence  employment rates  prevailing interest rates  inflation  and other economic conditions affecting consumer attitudes and disposable consumer income generally 
weakness in the economy and volatility or declines in the stock market could have an adverse effect on our business if consumers make fewer discretionary purchases as a result 
increases in consumer interest rates could cause a drop in sales because most of our customers finance their purchases 
furthermore  a general increase in commercial interest rates would increase the rates we pay on our floor plan contracts  which would decrease our operating income 
the seasonality of our business may result in a net loss 
to avoid a net loss for the year  we must generate sufficient sales during the quarters ending april and july to offset slower sales in the off season 
because of the difference in sales in the warm spring and summer months versus the cold fall and winter months  if our sales in the months of february through july are significantly lower than we expect  we may not earn profits or we may lose money and have a net loss 
our business  and the recreational vehicle industry in general  is seasonal 
our strongest sales period begins in january when many recreation vehicle shows are held 
strong sales demand continues through the summer months 
approximately of our average annual net sales over the last three years occurred in the quarter ending april with the exception of our store locations in florida  our sales are generally much lower in the quarter ending january our success depends on how well we integrate our recently acquired businesses into our current operations 
we recently underwent a period of rapid growth through acquisitions 
integrating the new business with our existing operations has already imposed significant difficulties on our ability to manage inventory and staffing requirements in multiple locations nationwide 
we may lose potential sales opportunities if we cannot accurately predict inventory or staffing requirements in addition  over staffing or an overabundance of inventory would increase our cost of sales and reduce our income from operations 
our growth will impose substantial added responsibilities on our existing senior management  including the need to identify  recruit and integrate new senior level managers 
this diversion of management resources may limit our ability to implement or to effectively oversee our growth and operating strategies 
we rely on several key manufacturers for almost all of our inventory purchases 
our success depends  to a significant extent  on continued relationships with two major manufacturers from whom we purchase approximately of our new products 
cancellation or modification of the dealer agreements with these two manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues by limiting the availability of desirable products 
dealer representation decisions for manufacturer brands are made at the manufacturers plants on a brand by brand basis  rather than centrally at each respective manufacturers corporate headquarters 
we currently purchase over brands of rvs and boats from over manufacturers 
the loss of a significant number of brands would reduce our competitiveness by decreasing our potential sales 
we must respond effectively to the competition we face from other rv dealers as well as businesses that offer products typically purchased with discretionary income 
we compete primarily on the basis of quality  available products  pricing and value  and customer service 
we will not generate sufficient revenues to maintain our business unless we convince potential customers to use their disposable income to purchase our products 
to compete effectively  we must be able to offer quality merchandise and service at prices generally equal to or lower than those of our competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
if our resources are not used to target the appropriate audience for our products  we will not be successful 
to achieve our growth strategy we must obtain and maintain adequate financing and capital 
our growth strategies depend upon our ability to obtain adequate financing and capital to purchase dealership locations and enter into strategic partnerships 
financing must be obtained for the floor plan of new and used vehicles  purchase  or purchase and lease back  of real property for dealership operations  acquisition of common stock from selling stockholders  working capital and other capital needs 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on suitable terms  our growth may be slower than expected and our operating results and financial condition will not be sufficient to achieve profitability 
much of our income is from financing  insurance and extended service contracts  which depend on third party lenders and insurance companies 
a substantial part of our gross profit comes from the fees we receive from banks and other lending companies 
we help our customers obtain financing by referring them to certain banks that have offered to provide financing for rv purchases 
the bank or other lending company pays us a fee for each loan they provide as a result of our referral 
if the lenders we arrange financing through lend to our customers directly rather than through us  we would not receive a referral fee 
in addition  the lenders we currently refer customers to may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan decisions  which could reduce the number of customers that we can refer 
our customers may also use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives 
if any of these events occur  we would lose a significant portion of our income and profit 
in addition  we generally offer our customers a service contract that provides additional warranty coverage on their rv or some of its parts after the manufacturer s original warranty expires  and various types of insurance policies that will provide money to pay a customer s rv loan if the customer dies or is physically disabled 
we sell these products as a broker for unrelated companies that specialize in these types of coverage 
we receive a fee for each product that we sell 
agency commission fees account for approximately of our total gross profit 
if our customers obtain these policies directly from the insurers  our net revenues could decline 
the nature of our business exposes us to liability for personal injury and property damage if any of the products we sell or service are defective 
the products that we sell  service and custom package have the potential to inflict significant injury or property damage 
even if the manufacturer causes the defect  we could be liable on the theory of third party product liability 
we carry insurance for this in addition to the general liability insurance generally maintained by the manufacturers  but it is possible that a claim would not be covered or would exceed our policy limits 
the limited number of publicly traded shares and the seasonality of our business make our stock subject to substantial volatility  which may hinder our ability to raise additional capital 
if the value of our common stock is too low  it will be difficult for us to raise additional capital through the sale of our shares 
this would also make it more difficult to make acquisitions using our common stock 
turnover of managerial personnel at several of our dealerships could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we are highly dependent upon each dealership s management for the on going operations of that dealership 
all of our revenue and most of our income is from retail sales and service that are geographically widespread throughout the continental us this geographic diversity makes it difficult for our top management to have a presence in all the locations on a regular basis 
turnover of managerial personnel at any dealership usually has an adverse effect on the sales and profitability at that location 
significant changes in the pricing and availability of fuel could cause a decline in sales 
our business is automotive in nature and depends upon ample supplies of fuel at reasonable costs 
significant increases in the price of gasoline or decreases in availability could result in fewer consumers purchasing rvs and or boats 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal  state  and local statutes and ordinances 
the adoption of more stringent statutes and regulations  changes in the interpretation of existing statutes and regulations or our entrance into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could curtail some of our operations 
it could also deny us the opportunity to operate in certain locations or restrict products or services offered by us 
various federal  state and local regulatory agencies  including the occupational safety and health administration  the united states environmental protection agency and similar federal and local agencies  have jurisdiction over the operation of our dealerships  repair facilities and other operations with respect to matters such as consumer protection  workers safety and laws regarding protection of the environment  including air  water and soil 
the failure to maintain all requisite licenses and permits and comply with all applicable federal  state and local regulations  requisite licenses and permits could limit our ability to operate out business 
as with vehicle dealerships generally  and parts and service operations in particular  our business involves the use  handling  storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes  including environmentally sensitive materials  such as motor oil  waste motor oil and filters  transmission fluid  antifreeze  freon  waste paint and lacquer thinner  batteries  solvents  lubricants  degreasing agents  gasoline  diesel fuels and other chemicals 
accordingly  we are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities establishing requirements for the use  management  handling and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards 
we are also subject to laws  ordinances and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
noncompliance with or changes to these requirements could limit our ability to operate our business 
soil contamination has been known to exist at certain properties owned or leased by us 
we have also been required and may in the future be required to remedy soil contamination or remove aboveground and underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances or wastes 
our customers and potential customers are subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances and regulations regarding the ownership of recreation vehicles and boats 
the adoption of more stringent statutes  ordinances and regulations effecting the consumer ownership of recreation vehicles or boats  could limit our ability to sell our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange 
to date  our revenue from operations has exclusively been denominated in united states dollars 
the rv and marine products that we have sold to date have been priced in united states dollars and all of our sales in the fiscal years  and  have been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may acquire rv or boat products that are priced in currencies other than united states dollars and we may expand sales operations outside the united states 
if either of these events occurs  fluctuations in the values of the respective currencies in which we purchase or sell could adversely affect us 
due to the constantly changing currency exposures and the volatility of currency exchange rates  there can be no assurance that we will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
in the event we conduct transactions in currencies other than the united states dollar  we intend to carefully evaluate our currency management policies 
if we deem it appropriate  we may consider hedging a portion of any currency exposure in the future 
interest rates 
we invest our surplus cash in financial instruments consisting principally of overnight bank repurchase agreements with fixed rates of interest 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
our overnight repurchase investments have some of the characteristics of floating rate securities  since the rates are subject to change each business day 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
if in the future we invest in longer term fixed rate investments we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we have variable floor plan notes payable that subject us to market risk exposure 
at october  we had a maximum of million available under floor plan contracts with million outstanding 
during fiscal  the maximum floor plan amount outstanding at any month end was million and the average floor plan outstanding for the year ended october  was million with weighted average interest rates ranging from to 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the floor plan interest of would impact operations by approximately  this is based on the assumption that our inventory and debt levels remain the same
