item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview for the fiscal year  cone had net sales from continuing operations of million  down substantially from net sales from continuing operations of million in sales for the year were negatively impacted by the economic recession  lower prices and retail inventory liquidations that occurred throughout the year 
for the year  after excluding charges associated with the reinvention plan and the closing of raytex  cone reported substantially reduced operating results from continuing operations  as compared with operating results were negatively impacted by general economic conditions  raw material costs and the events beginning september   which further disrupted retail sales and business activity 
by year end  cone had essentially finalized the implementation of its reinvention plan including initiatives to produce cost savings and profit improvements of approximately million 
denim results in were disappointing  as compared with results for were adversely affected by retailers continuous inventory liquidation throughout the year and an economic recession  all of which continued to place pressure on top line sales and forced reduced operating schedules at the plants 
cone exited the khaki business in because of a deteriorating us khaki market and a lack of critical mass within cone for this business 
denim pricing continued to be difficult as a result of the economic conditions  inventory liquidations and a chronic industry over capacity condition 
commission finishing at cone s carlisle plant continued its trend of improving operating results 
the raytex operation  the other component of the commission finishing segment  was closed in february of in august  cone sold its john wolf business and  despite difficult industry conditions  has managed to post positive operating results 
management believes that one of the most significant factors affecting operating margins is the price of cotton  which varied between the 
s and 
s per pound through much of and in cotton prices fell as low as 
per pound 
cone purchased cotton at fixed prices for delivery in while cone believes that its cotton commitments are at competitive levels  lower prices could adversely affect cone because of its forward purchases 
whether cotton prices are lower or higher in compared with will depend upon factors such as the strength of the us economy  global supply and demand conditions as they impact the export of us cotton and the level of equalization payments received under the us government cotton program 
other significant factors that influence cone s operating results and financial condition include general business cycles  consumer fashion preferences  changes in demand for print fabrics  international trade conditions  the relative strength of the us dollar and market interest rates  as well as the availability and terms of debt financing 
in the fourth quarter of  the us economy was in the midst of a recession 
by the end of the us textile industry had experienced its worst year in history 
a number of cone s competitors either filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of or exited cone s business segments 
it is difficult to forecast when the economy will improve  however  a number of economists believe the turn will come in the spring of assuming improved economic conditions  the exit of certain competitors and lower cotton costs  cone expects improved operating results beginning in the second quarter of as a result of the slowing economy  the federal reserve bank reduced its benchmark interest rate times during to a year low of 
however  cone expects its interest rate to remain essentially flat because of increased rates related to the extension of its bank credit facility and the maturity of its senior note to january  long term strategic initiatives the environment in which cone operates is extremely difficult 
the relative strength of the us dollar  weakness in consumer spending and reduction in business investment have pushed the us manufacturing sector into a recession 
textiles in particular have been affected adversely by the relative strength of the us dollar in comparison to the currencies of many asian countries 
the currency effect  global oversupply of apparel and textiles  retail consolidation and the slowing in consumer spending have resulted in extreme volume and pricing pressures for cone s products 
these conditions are expected to continue through early cone s business strategy is to invest and grow in its core franchises where it is recognized as a market leader 
as a result of economic and industry conditions  cone is focused on four initiatives engage in businesses in which cone believes it is an industry leader  retain  attract  motivate and focus a talented and capable management team  migrate to low cost manufacturing platforms for commodity products  and attract and efficiently invest capital 
on may   cone announced the initiation of its reinvention plan 
the objectives of the reinvention plan were to produce to million in annual cost savings or improvement in operating results of under performing businesses and to market actively non core assets including idle plants  property  equipment and excess inventories with a cash generation target of to million over months 
the reinvention plan initially had four components workforce reductions  changes in employee pay and benefit practices  streamlining of cone s business practices  which included a broad range of items from maintenance scheduling to vendor sourcing practices to the consolidation of denim operations to reduce us capacity  and improvement of the performance of the khaki and john wolf converted fabrics businesses 
subsequently  cone decided to exit the khaki business and sell its john wolf converted fabrics business 
to date the implementation of the reinvention plan has resulted in the reduction of the workforce by approximately employees  primarily at cone s corporate office and the rutherford county facilities  the freezing of benefits for salaried employees in the qualified and nonqualified pension plans  changes in business practices  and the consolidation of the haynes and florence denim facilities 
based upon economic and industry conditions as well as its business leadership criteria  cone made the decision to sell the john wolf business on august  cone did not have the size and scale to be able to compete efficiently in this business and in turn was unable to develop a business outlook that would provide an appropriate return on its investment in this operation 
cone received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale including the collection of accounts receivable 
in addition  cone exited the khaki business in the fourth quarter of the decision was primarily based on the fact that cone was not a leader in this category and believed the long term outlook for khaki produced in north america to be negative 
at the end of  the exit of the khaki segment was substantially complete 
cone will not have any significant involvement in the john wolf and khaki businesses and has accounted for their results as discontinued operations under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
cone has enacted initiatives to date that are expected to yield approximately million in annualized cost reduction  loss avoidance or business improvements 
for  cone has targeted additional initiatives that are expected to yield to million in additional savings per year 
in keeping with its strategy to reduce overhead costs  cone relocated its corporate headquarters to smaller  leased offices in december cone also relocated to smaller office space at its new york marketing office during during the course of  cone became a much simpler company with three main businesses 
cone believes it is the largest denim producer  the largest commission printer and finisher and a leader in us wide jacquard weaving 
these three businesses had positive operating income in cone s strategy is focused on the growth of its denim business by expanding capacity in mexico 
in  guilford mills  inc and cone entered into a joint venture to develop and operate a new textile and apparel industrial park in altamira  tamaulipas  mexico 
each company individually owns land for its respective textile operation and will contract with the jointly owned service company for infrastructure services  such as water  power and wastewater treatment 
cone plans to build a denim plant on its property with an initial capacity of million yards when financing is available 
depending upon the ultimate size and configuration  cone expects to invest between and million in the initial denim facility 
the funds required for the denim facility will require debt or equity financing and certain modifications to its current debt structure and lending agreements 
cone has not arranged financing or modified its debt structure or lending agreements to date  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that its present lenders will agree to the required modifications 
cone and its joint venture partner  cipsa  have agreed to expand parras cone s production capacity by up to 
as a result of a slowdown in the economy and an overall softness in basic denim in  the expansion has been delayed until financing can be secured 
the expansion will be financed by parras cone with internally generated cash flow and debt 
financing for the expansion has not been finalized and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions 
cone will continue to market and distribute of the fabric production at parras cone

fifty two weeks ended december  compared with fifty two weeks ended january  for the year  cone had sales from continuing operations of million  as compared with sales from continuing operations of million for denim segment sales and decorative fabrics segment sales were each up and  respectively  partially offset by weaker commission finishing sales primarily at the raytex facility 
gross profit for increased to of sales  as compared with for the previous year 
the improved gross profit for was a result of realization of benefits of the comprehensive restructuring program and improved capacity utilization in the denim operations partially offset by lower denim prices  weak market conditions for raytex and poor results for the decorative fabrics segment 
denim 
for  denim segment sales were million  an increase of from sales of million 
sales volume on a yardage basis for the denim segment increased by as the denim market recovered from a downturn

operating income for the segment includes cone s equity in earnings from the parras cone joint venture plant 
commission finishing 
outside sales total segment sales less intercompany sales of the commission finishing segment  which consisted of the carlisle and raytex plants  were million for  down from million for the majority of this sales decline was at the raytex plant where the year began with weak top of bed volume  especially from the major retail brands that outsourced production  raytex s markets continued to deteriorate throughout the year 
as discussed previously  these market conditions led to cone s decision to close the raytex plant 
for carlisle  overall print market conditions did not improve in however  because of the closing of several competitors  including its largest home decorative competitor  carlisle s market share increased at the end of for  the segment had an operating loss of million  as compared with a loss of million in the raytex plant lost million in versus a marginal loss of less than million in on the same basis 
carlisle s results benefited from the restructuring  downsizing and refocusing of the carlisle plant 
the operating improvements at carlisle were partially offset late in by higher energy costs and the start up costs associated with new business assumed from a competitor s plant upon its closing 
intercompany sales of this segment were to the denim and decorative fabrics segments 
decorative fabrics 
for  sales from continuing operations of the decorative fabrics segment were million  up from sales of million for the decorative fabrics segment had operating income of million in  as compared with earnings of million for results for were affected negatively by the lack of market demand for cone s product offerings  start up expenses associated with increasing capacity and operating efficiencies at the jacquard plant and difficulties with outsourcing

liquidity and capital resources cone s principal long term capital components consist of debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility  senior note  debentures and stockholders equity 
primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds  availability under the revolving credit facility and a million receivables purchase and servicing agreement the a r securitization facility 
on november   cone entered into agreements both to refinance and extend its revolving credit facility with its existing bank group and to extend the maturity on its senior note 
the new agreements provide for scheduled amortization and commitment reductions of million during with a new maturity date of january  in addition  the agreements provide for additional amortization and commitment reductions related to proceeds received by cone for permitted asset sales and of excess cash flow as defined in the agreements 
interest rates were increased and new covenant levels were established 
financing agreements of cone prohibit it from paying dividends on its common stock 
the following is a summary of primary financing agreements as of december interest facility amount discount financing agreement commitment outstanding rate maturity date amounts in millions debenture mar  senior note jan  revolving credit facility 
jan  a r securitization facility sept  at december   cone had availability under its financing agreements of million 
availability under the revolving credit facility and the a r securitization facility is determined by borrowing base calculations  as defined in the respective agreements 
during  cone generated cash from operations of million  as compared with cash from operations of million in other sources of cash flow included million in proceeds from sales of property and equipment for  as compared with million in uses of cash in included million for capital expenditures from continuing operations and million of net advances to the joint venture industrial park in altamira  tamaulipas  mexico 
cone believes that internally generated operating funds and funds available under its revolving credit facility currently in effect are sufficient to meet its needs for working capital and domestic capital spending permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility 
however  by january  cone must either refinance or replace the revolving credit facility and senior note 
if cone is unable to refinance this debt or is in default  in addition to the amounts owed  cone will be required to pay to the lenders within two years thereafter  upon notice from the lenders  an amount equal to the greater of million or of the market value of cone s outstanding common stock at the time of the notice 
there is no assurance that cone will be able to replace its revolving credit facility and its senior note or otherwise obtain financing on terms and conditions acceptable to cone 
cone has not yet been able to finance its proposed plant in altamira  tamaulipas  mexico  and its current debt structure will not permit that financing 
cone is in the process of exploring its alternatives related to financing its businesses in both the us and mexico 
on december   cone s long term capital structure consisted of million of long term debt including current maturities and million of stockholders equity 
for comparison  cone had million of long term debt including current maturities and million of stockholders equity in in  cone entered into a million notional interest rate swap  which converted its debentures to a floating interest rate 
in the fourth quarter of  cone terminated the swap for a cash payment of  converting interest expense on the debentures back to a fixed rate 
accounts receivable on december   were million  as compared with million at december  receivables  including those sold pursuant to the a r securitization facility  represented days of sales outstanding at december  and days at december  the increase in days outstanding was primarily the result of slower pay practices by certain customers 
inventories on december   were million  down million from million at december  the reduction is the result of the liquidation of core inventories  writedowns taken as part of cone s reinvention plan  the sale of john wolf  the exit from the khaki segment and lower cotton and other raw material prices 
for  domestic capital spending from continuing operations was million compared to million for the period 
domestic capital spending in is expected to be to million financed by internally generated funds 
other matters ebitda from continuing operations  which is presented not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from continuing operations as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of the ability to incur and service debt  is calculated by cone as follows in thousands fifty two weeks ended income loss from continuing operations    depreciation and amortization    inventory charges and facility consolidation charges    restructuring and impairment charges    ebitda    federal  state and local regulations relating to the workplace and the discharge of materials into the environment continue to change and  consequently  it is difficult to gauge the total future impact of such regulations on cone 
existing government regulations are not expected to cause a material change in cone s competitive position  operating results or planned capital expenditures 
cone has an active environmental committee  which fosters protection of the environment and compliance with laws 
from time to time  cone is a party to various legal claims and actions 
management believes that none of these claims or actions  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and liquidity of cone 
as a result of cone s recent operating results  management believes that the effects of any litigation  no matter how small or insignificant  could be considered material to cone s future results of operations 
as of december   no significant litigation existed 
off balance sheet financing arrangements cone s a r securitization facility is its only off balance sheet financing arrangement 
this facility generates funds by the sale of receivables in the us through cone receivables ii llc criillc 
criillc s sole business is the ongoing purchase and subsequent resale of certain trade receivables from cone 
criillc sells an undivided ownership interest in these receivables under an agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc 
criillc is a separate corporate entity with its own separate creditors who  in the event of its liquidation  will be entitled to be satisfied out of criillc s assets prior to any value in criillc becoming available to cone 
criillc retains no interests in those receivables transferred to gecc and has not experienced any gains or losses on the transfer of such receivables 
cone believes that minimal counterparty risk exists because of the financial strength of gecc 
in addition  the a r securitization facility is essentially asset neutral because of the inverse relationship between the level of accounts receivable and the level of cash proceeds available under the a r securitization facility  subject to funding limits 
see note  securitization of accounts receivable  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item transactions with related parties cone has various transactions in the normal course of business with its unconsolidated affiliated companies

cone and cipsa formed a company  parras cone  to build and operate a denim manufacturing facility in parras  mexico 
each shareholder has a interest in parras cone 
accordingly  cone records the equity in earnings of parras cone in its consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
cone purchases of the fabric production  markets the production to the end customer  handles production scheduling for the plant  provides financial management and cotton purchasing services and provides customer service on behalf of parras cone 
however  cone lacks board of director control and does not have sole discretion over parras cone s management  which prevents cone from consolidating the entity 
impairment of assets 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  cone estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles that cone expects to hold and use are based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
cone has made its best estimate of asset impairments as of december  see note  restructuring and impairment of assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item stock plans 
cone applies accounting principles board opinion number  accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans  which requires compensation expense for cone s options to be recognized only if the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
option prices are determined by the last reported sale price on the new york stock exchange composite tape on the date of grant 
accordingly  cone has not recognized compensation expense for any of its options granted
