item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
overview we develop enzyme therapies to treat serious  life threatening diseases and conditions 
we leverage our expertise in enzyme biology to develop product candidates for the treatment of genetic diseases  including mps i  mps vi and pku  as well as other critical care situations such as cardiovascular surgery and serious burns 
our product candidates address markets for which no products are currently available or where current products have been associated with major deficiencies 
we focus on conditions with well defined patient populations  including genetic diseases  which require chronic therapy 
our lead product candidate  aldurazyme  which recently completed a phase trial  is being developed for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis i mps i disease 
we are developing our second product candidate  neutralase  for reversal of anticoagulation by heparin in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  surgery and angioplasty 
in addition to aldurazyme and neutralase  we are developing other enzyme based therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions 
these include aryplase for the treatment of mps vi  vibrilase  a topical enzyme product for use in removing burned skin tissue in preparation for skin grafting or other therapy  and other enzyme product candidates  currently in preclinical development for genetic and other diseases 
results of operations in february  we decided to close the carbohydrate analytical business portion of our wholly owned subsidiary  glyko  inc  which provided all of glyko  inc s revenues 
the decision to close glyko  inc

in addition  net proceeds may also be used for research and development of other pipeline products  building of our supporting infrastructure  and other general corporate purposes 
we expect our current funds to last through we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations at least until because we expect to increase operational expenses and manufacturing investment for the joint venture and to increase research and development activities  including 
preclinical studies and clinical trials 
process development  including quality systems for product manufacture 
regulatory processes in the united states and international jurisdictions 
clinical and commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
expansion of sales and marketing activities until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we expect to continue our operations through the expenditure of our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and possibly supplement our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments through 
the sale of equity securities

critical accounting policies investment in biomarin genzyme llc and related revenue under the terms of our joint venture agreement with genzyme  genzyme and we have each agreed to provide percent of the funding for the joint venture 
all research and development  sales and marketing  and other activities performed by genzyme and us on behalf of the joint venture are billed to the joint venture at cost 
any profits or losses of the joint venture are shared equally by the two parties 
we provided million in funding to the joint venture from inception through december during the years ended december    and for the period from march  inception through december   we incurred expenses and billed million  million  million and million  respectively  for services provided to the joint venture under our agreement 
of these amounts  million  million  million and million  respectively  or percent  was recognized as revenue in accordance with our policy of recognizing revenue to the extent that research and development costs billed to the joint venture have been funded by genzyme 
at december   and  we had receivables of million and million  respectively  related to these billings 
we account for our investment in the joint venture using the equity method 
accordingly  we record a reduction in our investment in the joint venture for our percent share of the loss of the joint venture 
the percentage of the costs incurred by us and billed to the joint venture that are funded by us percent  is recorded as a credit to our equity in the loss of the joint venture 
discontinued operations the decision to close glyko  inc has resulted in the operations of glyko inc being classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  we have segregated the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in addition  we have segregated the operating results in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and and for the period from march  inception to december   and have segregated cash flows from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the same periods 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements reflect the classification of glyko inc operations as discontinued operations 
the loss on disposal of discontinued operations included in our consolidated statement of operations reflects certain adjustments required at december  primarily to record an impairment reserve against the unamortized goodwill related to glyko  inc of approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of glyko  inc in  we recorded intangible assets of million 
additional intangible assets of  were recorded in connection with the acquisition by glyko  inc of the key assets of the bio chemical research reagent division of oxford glycosciences plc 
ogs  a company not related to glyko  inc during  we revised our estimate of the useful life of these intangible assets downward to years  the effect of this change increased amortization expense in we recorded an impairment reserve against the unamortized balance of million at december  as a result of our decision to close the business 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio
