item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition prepared foods overview 
during fiscal  million  or  of our us turkey net sales were prepared turkey products sold to foodservice customers and retail distributors 
like the us chicken markets  the market for prepared turkey products has experienced greater growth and higher margins than fresh turkey products and the production and sale of prepared turkey products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient costs are the single largest component of our turkey division cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our turkey cost of goods sold in fiscal similarly with the chicken business  as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
we establish prices for our prepared turkey products based primarily upon perceived value to the customer  production costs and prices of competing products 
the majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price or are subject to a market driven formula 
fresh turkey overview 
our fresh turkey business is an important component of our sales and accounted for million  or  of our us turkey net sales in fiscal as is typical for the industry  a significant portion of the sales of fresh and frozen whole turkeys is seasonal in nature  with the height of sales occurring during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays 
in addition to maintaining sales of mature  traditional fresh turkey products  our strategy is to shift the mix of our fresh turkey products by continuing to increase sales of higher margin  faster growing value added prepared turkey products  such as deli meats  ground turkey  turkey burgers and sausage  roasted turkey and salads 
most fresh turkey products are sold to established customers pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price or are subject to a market driven formula with some agreements based upon market prices reported by the usda and other public price reporting services  plus a markup  which is dependent upon the customer s location  volume  product specifications and other factors 
we believe our practices with respect to sales of fresh turkey are generally consistent with those of our competitors with similar programs 
prices of these products are generally negotiated daily or weekly 
export and other turkey products overview 
our export and other turkey products consist primarily of turkey parts sold primarily in bulk  non branded form frozen for distribution to export markets and refrigerated and frozen frankfurters sold in a branded form 
in fiscal  approximately million  or  of our total us turkey sales were attributable to export and other sales 
these exports and other products have historically been characterized by lower prices and greater price volatility than our more value added product lines 
effective november   we are no longer producing frankfurters  although we continue to distribute frankfurters produced by others 
markets for chicken products foodservice 
the majority of our us chicken sales are derived from products sold to the foodservice market 
this market principally consists of chain restaurants  food processors and certain other institutions located throughout the continental united states 
we supply chicken products ranging from portion controlled refrigerated chicken parts to fully cooked and frozen  breaded or non breaded chicken parts or formed products 
we believe pilgrim s pride is well positioned to be the primary or secondary supplier to many national and international chain restaurants who require multiple suppliers of chicken products 
additionally  we are well suited to be the sole supplier for many regional chain restaurants 
regional chain restaurants often offer better margin opportunities and a growing base of business 
we believe we have significant competitive strengths in terms of full line product capabilities  high volume production capacities  research and development expertise and extensive distribution and marketing experience relative to smaller and to non vertically integrated producers 
while the overall chicken market has grown consistently  we believe the majority of this growth in recent years has been in the foodservice market 
according to the national chicken council  during the through period  sales of chicken products to the foodservice market grew at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately  versus growth for the chicken industry overall 
foodservice growth is anticipated to continue as food away from home expenditures continue to outpace overall industry rates 
according to the national restaurant association  food away from home expenditures grew at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately during the through period and are projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate from through as a result  the food away from home category is projected by the national restaurant association to account for of total food expenditures by  as compared with in our sales to the foodservice market from fiscal through fiscal grew at a compounded annual growth rate of and represented of the net sales of our us chicken operations in fiscal foodservice prepared foods 
the majority of our sales to the foodservice market consist of prepared foods products 
our prepared chicken products sales to the foodservice market were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
we attribute this growth in sales of prepared chicken products to the foodservice market to a number of factors first  there has been significant growth in the number of foodservice operators offering chicken on their menus and the number of chicken items offered 
second  foodservice operators are increasingly purchasing prepared chicken products  which allow them to reduce labor costs while providing greater product consistency  quality and variety across all restaurant locations 
third  there is a strong need among larger foodservice companies for an alternative or additional supplier to our principal competitor in the prepared chicken products market 
a viable alternative supplier must be able to ensure supply  demonstrate innovation and new product development and provide competitive pricing 
we have been successful in our objective of becoming the alternative supplier of choice by being the primary or secondary prepared chicken products supplier to many large foodservice companies because we are vertically integrated  giving us control over our supply of chicken and chicken parts  our further processing facilities are particularly well suited to the high volume production runs necessary to meet the capacity and quality requirements of the foodservice market  and we have established a reputation for dependable quality  highly responsive service and excellent technical support 
fourth  as a result of the experience and reputation developed with larger customers  we have increasingly become the principal supplier to mid sized foodservice organizations 
fifth  our in house product development group follows a customer driven research and development focus designed to develop new products to meet customers changing needs 
our research and development personnel often work directly with institutional customers in developing products for these customers 
approximately million  or  of our chicken sales to foodservice customers in fiscal consisted of new products which were not sold by us in fiscal sixth  we are a leader in utilizing advanced processing technology  which enables us to better meet our customers needs for product innovation  consistent quality and cost efficiency 
foodservice fresh chicken 
we produce and market fresh  refrigerated chicken for sale to us quick service restaurant chains  delicatessens and other customers 
these chickens have the giblets removed  are usually of specific weight ranges  and are usually pre cut to customer specifications 
they are often marinated to enhance value and product differentiation 
by growing and processing to customers specifications  we are able to assist quick service restaurant chains in controlling costs and maintaining quality and size consistency of chicken pieces sold to the consumer 
retail 
the retail market consists primarily of grocery store chains  wholesale clubs and other retail distributors 
we concentrate our efforts in this market on sales of branded  prepackaged cut up and whole chicken to grocery store chains and retail distributors in the midwestern  southwestern  western and eastern regions of the united states 
this regional marketing focus enables us to develop consumer brand franchises and capitalize on proximity to the trade customer in terms of lower transportation costs  more timely  responsive service  and enhanced product freshness 
for a number of years  we have invested in both trade and retail marketing designed to establish high levels of brand name awareness and consumer preferences 
we utilize numerous marketing techniques  including advertising  to develop and strengthen trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products marketed under the pilgrim s pride reg trade mark brand 
our founder  lonnie bo pilgrim  is the featured spokesman in our television  radio and print advertising  and a trademark cameo of a person wearing a pilgrim s hat serves as the logo on all of our primary branded products 
as a result of this marketing strategy  pilgrim s pride reg trade mark is a well known brand name in several southwestern markets  including dallas fort worth  houston and san antonio  texas  oklahoma city  oklahoma  denver  colorado  phoenix  arizona and los angeles and san diego  california 
we believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and loyalty help to provide more secure distribution for our products 
we also believe our efforts at brand awareness generate greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case in certain southwestern markets 
we also maintain an active program to identify consumer preferences 
the program primarily consists of testing new product ideas  packaging designs and methods through taste panels and focus groups located in key geographic markets 
retail prepared foods

russia accounted for approximately of all us poultry exports in  or approximately of the total us poultry production 
on april  russia announced the lifting of the import ban 
however  us markets continue to be affected as russia continues to restrict the import of us poultry products 
on september  new sanitary guidelines were established by russia that requires veterinary specialists from the agriculture ministry of russia to inspect and certify plants of us poultry producers interested in exporting to russia 
we expect this certification process to be completed in calendar and expect that the industry will resume exporting these products into russia shortly thereafter  however  once exports resume  there is no assurance that they will regain the levels existing prior to the march  ban 
historically  we have targeted international markets to generate additional demand for our chicken dark meat  which is a natural by product of our us operations given our concentration on prepared foods products and the us customers general preference for white meat 
we have also begun selling prepared chicken products for export to the international divisions of our us chain restaurant customers 
we believe that us chicken exports will continue to grow as worldwide demand increases for high grade  low cost protein sources

also included in these categories are chicken by products  which are converted into protein products sold primarily to manufacturers of pet foods

the us egg industry has been consolidating over the last few years  with the largest producers accounting for more than of the total number of egg laying hens in service during we compete with other us egg producers primarily on the basis of product quality  reliability  price and customer service 
in  we introduced a high nutrient egg called eggsplus trademark 
this egg contains high levels of omega and omega fatty acids along with vitamin e  making the egg a heart friendly product 
our marketing of eggsplus trademark has received national recognition for our progress in being an innovator in the functional foods category 
in addition  we produce and sell livestock feeds at our feed mill in mt

we engage in similar sales activities at our other us feed mills 
mexico background the mexican market represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal recognizing favorable long term demographic trends and improving economic conditions in mexico  in the s we began exploring opportunities to produce and market chicken in mexico 
in fiscal  we acquired four vertically integrated chicken production operations in mexico for approximately million 
since this original acquisition  we have made subsequent acquisitions and capital expenditures in mexico to modernize our production technology  improve our distribution network and expand our operations 
in addition  we have transferred experienced management personnel from the us and developed a strong local management team 
as a result of these expenditures  we have increased weekly production in our mexican operations by over since our original investment in fiscal we are now the second largest producer of chicken in mexico 
we believe that our facilities are among the most technologically advanced in mexico and that we are one of the lowest cost producers of chicken in mexico 
product types while the market for chicken products in mexico is less developed than in the united states  with sales attributed to fewer  more basic products  the market for value added products is increasing 
our strategy is to lead this trend 
the products currently sold by us in mexico consist primarily of lower value added products such as eviscerated chicken and chicken parts and basic products such as new york dressed whole chickens with only feathers and blood removed and live birds 
we have increased our sales of value added products  primarily through national retail chains and restaurants  and it is our business strategy to continue to do so 
in addition  we remain opportunistic  utilizing our low cost production to enter markets where profitable opportunities exist 
other products sold by us in mexico include commercial feed  vaccines and other agricultural products 
markets we sell our mexico chicken products primarily to large wholesalers and retailers 
our customer base in mexico covers a broad geographic area from mexico city  the capital of mexico with a population estimated to be over million  to saltillo  the capital of the state of coahuila  about miles north of mexico city  and from tampico and veracruz on the gulf of mexico to acapulco on the pacific  which region includes the cities of san luis potosi and queretaro  capitals of the states of the same name  and cancun on the caribbean 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality  service and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   requires annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november  the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action is warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry are eliminated in january the action stems from concerns of the union nacional avicultores una that duty free imports of leg quarters would injure the mexico poultry industry 
a suggested safeguard by the una is to establish a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters at the tariff level of of the sales price for a period of three to five years 
while the extent of the impact of the elimination of tariffs is uncertain  we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this elimination 
we have an extensive distribution network in mexico  which distributes products to of the mexican states  encompassing approximately of the total population of mexico 
our distribution network is comprised of eighteen distribution centers utilizing approximately company owned vehicles 
we believe this distribution network will be an important asset in distributing our own  as well as other companies  us produced chicken into mexico 
competition the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive and some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
in the united states and mexico  we compete principally with other vertically integrated chicken and turkey companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us chicken and turkey industries include price  product quality  product development  brand identification  breadth of product line and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that product quality  brand awareness and customer service are the primary bases of competition 
there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the us prepared food business 
we believe we have significant  long term cost and quality advantages over non vertically integrated further processors 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality  service and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   requires annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  as such tariffs are reduced  we expect greater amounts of chicken to be imported into mexico from the us  which could negatively affect the profitability of mexican chicken producers and positively affect the profitability of us exporters of chicken to mexico 
on november  the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action is warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry are eliminated in january the action stems from concerns of the union nacional avicultores una that duty free imports of leg quarters would injure the mexico poultry industry 
a suggested safeguard by the una is to establish a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters at the tariff level of of the sales price for a period of three to five years 
while the extent of the impact of the elimination of tariffs is uncertain  we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this elimination for two reasons 
first  we have an extensive distribution network in mexico  which distributes products to of the mexican states  encompassing approximately of the total population of mexico 
we believe this distribution network will be an important asset in distributing our own  as well as other companies  us produced chicken into mexico 
second  we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which will provide us with cost advantages in exporting us chicken into mexico 
these facilities include our processing facilities in mt 
pleasant  pittsburg  lufkin  nacogdoches  dallas and waco  texas  and distribution facilities in san antonio and el paso  texas and phoenix  arizona 
other activities we have regional distribution centers located in arlington  el paso  mt 
pleasant and san antonio  texas  and phoenix  arizona that distribute our own poultry products  along with certain poultry and non poultry products purchased from third parties  to independent grocers and quick service restaurants 
our non poultry distribution business is conducted as an accommodation to our customers and to achieve greater economies of scale in distribution logistics 
the store door delivery capabilities for our own poultry products provide a strategic service advantage in selling to quick service  national chain restaurants 
regulation and environmental matters the chicken and turkey industries are subject to government regulation  particularly in the health and environmental areas  including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  by the centers for disease control  the usda  the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency in the united states and by similar governmental agencies in mexico 
our chicken processing facilities in the us are subject to on site examination  inspection and regulation by the usda 
the fda inspects the production of our feed mills in the us our mexican food processing facilities and feed mills are subject to on site examination  inspection and regulation by a mexican governmental agency  which performs functions similar to those performed by the usda and fda 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the operations of our facilities 
we anticipate increased regulation by the usda concerning food safety  by the fda concerning the use of medications in feed and by the epa and various other state agencies concerning the disposal of chicken by products and wastewater discharges 
although we do not anticipate any regulations having a material adverse effect upon us  a material adverse effect may occur

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general profitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
cyclical earnings fluctuations can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared foods products 
prepared foods products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our consolidated cost of goods sold in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
business segments we operate in two reportable business segments as a producer of chicken and other products and a producer of turkey products 
our chicken and other products segment primarily includes sales of chicken products we produce and purchase for resale in the united states and mexico  but also includes the sale of table eggs  feed and other items 
our chicken and other products segment conducts separate operations in the united states and mexico and is reported as two separate geographical areas 
our turkey segment includes sales of turkey products produced in our turkey operation  which operate exclusively in the united states 
inter area sales and inter segment sales  which are not material  are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer sales 
corporate expenses are included with chicken and other products

the following table presents certain items as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes net income results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal on january   we completed the acquisition of wlr foods now the company s eastern division  a vertically integrated producer of chicken and turkey products located in the eastern united states  for approximately million and the assumption of approximately million of indebtedness 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated based on the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities 
wlr foods operations have been included in our financial results since the acquisition on january  accordingly  only weeks of operations of the former wlr foods are included in our results for fiscal wlr foods was the seventh largest poultry company in the united states with million of revenue in calendar year the wlr foods acquisition provided us with chicken processing facilities in the eastern united states  where we previously had no facilities  enabling us to deliver poultry products within one day to markets accounting for approximately of the us population  significant opportunities to realize synergies between wlr foods and our pre existing chicken operations  and diversification of our revenue stream into the billion turkey industry  where we can capitalize on our prepared foods processing expertise 
currently  our eastern division s chicken sales mix consists mostly of lower margin fresh chicken products 
however  we intend to convert more of our eastern division chicken sales mix into higher margin  fresh and prepared chicken products in the years to come 
by consistent and continued application of our long term business strategy to both our recently acquired eastern division and our existing fresh chicken mix  we believe that our overall product mix will return to the levels existing prior to the wlr foods acquisition in subsequent years 
since the acquisition of wlr foods  our eastern division  which consists of the former wlr foods operations  has been affected by two significant unexpected challenges 
first  on march  an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza  a disease contagious to turkey  chicken and other birds  was discovered in virginia 
during fiscal  we estimate that our operating income was negatively impacted by approximately million due to the negative impact of the avian influenza 
as of september   poultry growers and producers have destroyed approximately million head of poultry affected as a result of the virus 
turkeys represent approximately of the destroyed poultry  with chickens representing approximately 
approximately one half of the turkeys and approximately three quarters of the chickens destroyed by the poultry industry in virginia belonged to the company 
no new flocks have tested positive for the presence of avian influenza in virginia since july  we currently estimate that production in our turkey operation will be significantly reduced over the first six months of fiscal due to the effects of this viral outbreak 
as a result of this lower production output in our turkey operation  we anticipate that operating income from our turkey operation will decrease for the first six months of fiscal by approximately to million  when compared to the first six months of fiscal  assuming the outbreak of avian influenza has been contained 
on june   us secretary of agriculture ann veneman proposed to the office of management and budget that the us department of agriculture usda cover one half of the total estimated economic loss suffered by the poultry industry and independent growers in virginia due to the avian influenza outbreak 
secretary veneman also recommended that the government of virginia cover the remaining portion 
it is our understanding that  as part of her proposal  secretary veneman is suggesting that independent chicken and turkey growers are to be fully compensated for their losses first and that the remainder is to be allocated to other poultry producers including us whose flocks were destroyed by the virus 
on november  the department of agriculture made public their estimate of total federal compensation at million  with growers being compensated million and owners being compensated million 
no assurance can be given as to the amount of federal compensation that we may receive or that any state agencies will in fact provide further economic assistance to the poultry growers and producers affected by the avian influenza outbreak in virginia 
no anticipated recoveries have been recorded by us as our portion of the compensation has not yet been determined 
in the event that state agencies do decide to grant economic assistance to the affected poultry growers and producers  it is impossible at this time to estimate how the state agencies would allocate any such assistance between affected poultry growers and producers whose flocks were destroyed by the virus 
the second challenge faced by our eastern division was that in october a limited number of usda samples from the company s franconia  pennsylvania plant tested positive for listeria 
as a result the company voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  additionally as a precautionary measure  we immediately suspended operations at our franconia facility to redouble our food safety and sanitation efforts 
no illnesses associated with the listeria strain in a northeastern outbreak have been linked to any of our products  and our franconia facility has been reviewed and inspected by the usda and reopened on november  as the recall occurred in early fiscal  it did not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as of september  in addition  we carry insurance designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by the recall 
as a result  we believe that the recall and its direct effects will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity after considering available insurance coverage 
however  there will likely be differences between the accounting periods in which certain recall effects are realized and when insurance recoveries are received  and there can be no assurances as to the company s ability to re establish the products and sales affected by the recall 
consolidated net income before tax 
consolidated net income before tax is affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
assuming the peso exchange rate does not change from the rate at the end of fiscal  approximately million of future devaluation will result as remaining inventory is sold 
on september   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  compared to to us dollar on september   and at to us dollar on december  no assurances can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
consolidated net sales 
consolidated net sales were billion for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in consolidated net sales resulted from a million increase in us chicken sales to billion  a million increase in turkey sales to million  a million increase in mexico chicken sales to million and a million increase in sales of other products to million 
the increase in us chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced  which resulted primarily from the acquisition of wlr foods on january  offset partially by a decrease in total revenue per dressed pound produced  caused in part by import restrictions on poultry products typically sold to russia and japan by the industry  resulting in production being liquidated at less favorable pricing levels 
the increase in turkey sales was due to the acquisition of wlr foods  partially offset by the impact of the avian influenza discussed above 
the million increase in mexico chicken sales was primarily due to an increase in average revenue per dressed pound produced  partially offset by a decrease in pounds produced 
the million increase in sales of other us products was primarily due to poultry by products sales price increases  an increase in sales by the company s wholesale feed division and the acquisition of wlr foods 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales was billion in fiscal  an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal the us operations accounted for million of the increase in the cost of sales and our mexico operations accounted for million of the increase 
the cost of sales increase in our us operations of million was due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods  million of which is related to the turkey operations and was impacted by the avian influenza discussed above 
the increase in cost of sales of chicken products also resulted from increased sales of higher cost prepared foods products 
the million cost of sales increase in our mexico operations was primarily due to production of a higher cost  more value added product mix compared to the prior year 
gross profit 
gross profit was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from the same period last year  due primarily to the negative effects of the avian influenza outbreak in our eastern division and to lower dark meat sales prices in the us caused in part by import restrictions on poultry products typically sold to russia and japan by the industry 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal  primarily due to increased operating expenses incurred in connection with the avian influenza outbreak in our eastern division and lower dark meat sales prices in the us caused in part by import restrictions on poultry products typically sold to russia and japan by the industry 
consolidated selling  general and administrative 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase was due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods  which was completed on january  consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly in fiscal to  compared to in fiscal operating income 
consolidated operating income was million for fiscal  decreasing by approximately million  when compared to fiscal due primarily to the negative effects of the avian influenza outbreak in our eastern division and to lower dark meat sales prices in the us caused in part by import restrictions on poultry products typically sold to russia and japan by the industry 
interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances experienced in the year 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax benefit in fiscal was million compared to an income tax expense of million in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by the million income tax benefit resulting from changes in the mexico tax law and lower pretax earnings in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal on january   we completed the acquisition of wlr foods  a vertically integrated producer of chicken and turkey products located in the eastern united states 
accordingly  weeks of operations of the former wlr foods are included in our results for fiscal consolidated net sales 
consolidated net sales were billion for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in consolidated net sales resulted from a million increase in us chicken sales to billion  a million increase in turkey sales  a million increase in sales of other products to million and by a million increase in mexico chicken sales to million 
the increase in us chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced  which resulted primarily from the acquisition of wlr foods  and to a increase in total revenue per dressed pound produced 
the increase in turkey sales was due to the acquisition of wlr foods 
the million increase in sales of other us products to million was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods and higher prices in our commercial egg operations 
the million increase in mexico chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced offset partially by a decrease in average revenue per dressed pound produced  primarily due to lower prices caused by an over supply of chicken 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales was billion in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal the us operations accounted for million of the increase in the cost of sales and our mexico operations accounted for million of the increase 
the cost of sales increase in our us operations of million was due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods  million of which related to the turkey operations  but also resulted from increased production of higher cost prepared foods products  higher energy costs and higher feed ingredient costs 
the million cost of sales increase in our mexico operations was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced 
gross profit 
gross profit was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over the same period last year  due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods

operating income 
consolidated operating income was million for fiscal  an increase of million when compared to fiscal  resulting primarily from higher volumes from the acquisition of wlr foods and higher sales prices in the us interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due to higher outstanding balances incurred for the acquisition of wlr foods 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal increased to million compared to an expense of million in fiscal this increase resulted from higher us pre tax earnings in fiscal than in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we maintain million in revolving credit facilities  million of which is related to our mexican operations  and million in a secured revolving term borrowing facility  subject to certain limitations including availability of collateral 
the million revolving term borrowing facility provides for million and million of year and year commitments  respectively 
borrowings under these facilities are split pro rata between the year and year maturities as they occur 
the credit facilities provide for interest at rates ranging from libor plus five eighths percent to libor plus two and three quarters percent  depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
interest rates on debt outstanding under these facilities as of september  ranged from libor plus one and three quarters percent to libor plus two percent 
these facilities are secured by inventory and fixed assets  the million facility in mexico is further secured by mexican accounts receivables  inventories and certain fixed assets 
at september   million was available under the revolving credit facilities including million in mexico and million was available under the revolving term borrowing facility 
at december  we had million available under our revolving credit facilities and million available under the revolving term borrowing facility and cash on hand of million compared to million at september   due primarily to advances subsequent to year end on the various facilities  for a total liquidity of million at december  compared to million at september  on june   we entered into an asset sale agreement to sell up to million of accounts receivable 
in connection with the asset sale agreement  we sell  on a revolving basis  certain of our trade receivables the pooled receivables to a special purpose corporation wholly owned by us  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest to third parties 
at september  and september   an interest in these pooled receivables of million had been sold to third parties and is reflected as a reduction in accounts receivable during each period 
this sales agreement expires on june  if this facility is not replaced or extended the company will likely use its revolving term borrowing facility to provide this liquidity 
these transactions have been recorded as sales in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the gross proceeds resulting from the sale are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
losses on these sales were immaterial 
on june   the camp county industrial development corporation issued million of variable rate environmental facilities revenue bonds supported by letters of credit obtained by us 
we may draw from these proceeds over the construction period for new sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at a poultry by products plant to be built in camp county  texas 
we are not required to borrow the full amount of the proceeds from the bonds 
all amounts borrowed from these funds will be due in the amounts that we borrow will be reflected as debt when received from the camp county industrial development corporation 
the interest rates on amounts borrowed will closely follow the tax exempt commercial paper rates 
presently  there are no borrowings outstanding under the bonds 
on august   pilgrim s pride issued million in senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of maturing on september  the proceeds from the notes offering were used to redeem the remaining million outstanding of our senior subordinated notes due the balance of the proceeds was used to reduce indebtedness under our million revolving term borrowing facility 
at september   our working capital decreased to million and our current ratio decreased to to  compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september   primarily due to the working capital changes discussed below 
contractual obligations and guarantees 
obligations under long term debt and non cancelable operating leases at september  are as follows in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt a guarantee fees operating leases total a excludes million in letters of credit outstanding related to normal business transactions 
trade accounts and other receivables were million at september   compared to million at september  the million  or  decrease in trade accounts and other receivables was primarily due to improvements in collection efficiencies 
excluding the sale of receivables  trade accounts and other receivables would have decreased million  to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal inventories were million at september   compared to million at september  the million  or  increase in inventories was primarily due to increases in finished turkey products inventories resulting from changes made in product mix in connection with the outbreak of avian influenza see general  overview and developments which inventories are expected to be liquidated during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million to million at september   compared to million at september  due to an increase in higher feed  other ingredients  packaging costs  and other expenses 
capital expenditures of million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively  were primarily incurred to acquire and expand certain facilities  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we anticipate spending approximately million to million in fiscal to improve efficiencies and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we expect to finance such expenditures with available operating cash flows and existing revolving term and revolving credit facilities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a full year impact from the former wlr foods operations in fiscal  compared to weeks in fiscal the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an overall increase of accounts receivable  due primarily to a higher level of sales activity and increased inventories  due primarily to higher levels of live poultry and frozen turkey inventories due primarily to seasonal variations in the live production cycle and sales of turkey products  both of which were primarily a result of the wlr foods acquisition  and lower net income for fiscal cash flows used in provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is primarily due to borrowings to finance the acquisition of wlr foods in the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  reflects the net proceeds from borrowings to finance the acquisition of wlr foods 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer programs and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or upon transfer of ownership of the product to the customer and is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts reflecting estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
live poultry inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeder hens at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or market 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over the productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventory and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting the inventories obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  primarily including leg quarters  wings  tenders and offal  which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost 
as a result  our lower of cost or market evaluation is done separately on a pool basis for all chicken and turkey products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
the assumption used to arrive at periodic expenses is reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
taxes are provided for international subsidiaries based on the assumption that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the company and within individual companies and as such taxes are not provided in the us or local jurisdictions that would be required in the event of distribution of these earnings 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of the individual operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients we purchase certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  we will from time to time lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
we do not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of september  based on our feed consumption during fiscal  such an increase would have resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million  excluding the impact of any hedging in that period 
as of september   we had hedged of our feed requirements 
foreign currency our earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos 
we manage this exposure primarily by attempting to minimize our mexican peso net monetary position  but from time to time we have also considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
such instruments  however  have historically not been economically feasible 
we are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the united states 
however  we currently anticipate that the cash flows of our mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in our mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our results of operations and financial position in several manners  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos  was a loss of million in fiscal and a loss of million and gain of million in fiscal and  respectively 
on december   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  compared to at september  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
interest rates our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt instruments 
the acquisition of wlr foods substantially increased our outstanding balances of variable rate debt 
we have variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of our long term debt at september  holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a basis points increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by million for fiscal these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate long term debt at september  market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of september   using discounted cash flow analysis 
impact of inflation due to low to moderate inflation in the us and mexico and our rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period 
forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee and similar expressions  are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include those described under risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  among others  many of which are beyond our control 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking  and specifically decline to undertake  any obligation to address or update each or any factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results  and we are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes or information contained in previous filings or communications 
though we have attempted to list comprehensively these important cautionary risk factors  we wish to caution investors and others that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our business or results of operations 
risk factors cyclicality and commodity prices 
industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey 
profitability in the chicken and turkey industries is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens and turkeys or deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  to the extent available  to enter into advance purchase commitments or financial hedging contracts for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
the use of such instruments may not be successful 
substantial leverage 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and expect to continue to have  a substantial amount of indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness  including our debt securities  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain necessary financing and to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and sell assets  make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable interest rates  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds  and failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and chicken parts and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
additional borrowings available 
despite our substantial indebtedness  we may still be able to incur significantly more debt 
this could intensify the risks described above 
despite our substantial indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future 
if additional debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
integration of the eastern division 
we have only recently acquired the eastern division and may not be able to successfully integrate its operations over the long term 
we only recently began to operate the businesses of pilgrim s pride and the eastern division as a combined entity 
the acquisition of the eastern division has significantly increased our size and operations 
our prospects should be considered in light of the numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations 
although our management has significant experience in the chicken industry  there can be no assurance as to our ability to effectively integrate wlr foods or fully realize the associated cost savings and operating synergies currently anticipated 
contamination of products 
if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
poultry products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms  or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and generic e coli 
these pathogens are generally found in the environment and  as a result  there is a risk that they  as a result of food processing  could be present in our processed poultry products 
these pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
these risks may be controlled  but may not be eliminated  by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing 
the company has little  if any  control over proper handling once the product has been shipped 
illness and death may result if the pathogens are not eliminated at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and prospects 
as described in detail under item business general overview and recent developments  in october one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria and we later received information from the usda suggesting that environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result of these findings  we recalled all cooked deli products produced at the facility from may  through october  and temporarily suspended operations at the facility to redouble our food safety and sanitation efforts 
there can be no assurance that there will not be additional recalls of our products in the future or that this recall or any such future recall or any litigation arising therefrom will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
livestock and poultry disease 
outbreaks of livestock diseases in general  and poultry disease in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  turkey or other products to or from our suppliers  facilities or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation and prospects 
as described in more detail under item business general overview and recent developments  an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza  a disease contagious to turkey  chicken and other birds  has had a material adverse effect on our fiscal operating results and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our results through at least the first six months of fiscal there can be no assurance that the losses associated with this avian influenza outbreak will not be greater than anticipated or that any future poultry disease outbreaks will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability 
product liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators 
the packaging  marketing and distribution of food products entails an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity 
we may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury  illness or death 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or damage to the products 
in addition to the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by our production or processing operations  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to perform product recalls  or that product liability claims will not be asserted against us  in the future 
any claims that may be made may create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as described above under contamination of products if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
we recently recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october  in connection with this recall  a class action lawsuit was filed against us on behalf of a putative class of persons that purchased and or consumed meat products subject to the recall and we have received a substantial amount of press 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any class action litigation or reputational injury associated with this or any future product recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons  for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
our business operations entail a number of risks  including risks relating to product liability claims  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons 
we currently maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks  including product liability and recall insurance  property insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance  but in many cases such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events  or at all 
moreover  even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events  it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events 
for example  in the past one of our insurers encountered financial difficulties and was unable to fulfill its obligations under one of our insurance policies and one of our insurers contested coverage with respect to a claim forcing us to litigate the issue of coverage 
as described above under contamination of products if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls  we recently recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october   and a class action lawsuit was filed against us on behalf of a putative class of persons that purchased and or consumed meat products subject to the recall 
we have notified our insurers as to the occurrence of these events and made one claim to date under our product recall insurance policy 
while we carry insurance designed to cover recall events such as this and we believe that the insurance policies purchased will cover the direct costs associated with the product recall and related product liability claims and  subject to the insurer s reservation of rights  we have received a million advance payment from our insurer with respect to the product recall claim  no assurances can be given that such insurance will in fact adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with this recall or any such future events 
potential acquisitions 
we may pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  which could increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions 
additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
foreign operations risks 
our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
we have substantial operations and assets located in mexico 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past 
exchange rate fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our operations in mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws of mexico 
we may rely in part on intercompany loans and distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our claims 
additionally  the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make payments and distributions to us will be subject to  among other things  mexican law 
in the past  these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions 
however  laws such as these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including in the health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
control of voting stock 
voting control over pilgrim s pride is maintained by lonnie bo pilgrim and lonnie ken pilgrim 
through a limited partnership of which they are the only general partners  lonnie bo pilgrim and his son lonnie ken pilgrim have voting control of of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
they are therefore in a position to control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this ensures their ability to control the future direction and management of pilgrim s pride 
if lonnie bo pilgrim and certain members of his family cease to own at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock  it will constitute an event of default under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
risks associated with tax status 
potential payment of deferred taxes may affect our cash flow 
before july   we used the cash method of accounting for income tax purposes 
pursuant to changes in the laws enacted by the revenue act of  we were required to change our method of accounting for federal income tax purposes from the cash method to the accrual method 
as a consequence of this change in our accounting method  we were permitted to create a suspense account in the amount of approximately million 
the money in the suspense account represents deferred income arising from our prior use of the cash method of accounting 
beginning in fiscal  we are generally required to include th of the amount in the suspense account  or approximately million  in taxable income each year for the next years 
as of september   the balance in the suspense account was approximately million 
however  the full amount must be included in taxable income in any year that pilgrim s pride ceases to be a family corporation 
we will cease to be a family corporation if lonnie bo pilgrim s family ceases to own at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote 
if that occurs  we would be required to recognize the balance of the suspense account in taxable income 
currently there exists no plan or intention on the part of lonnie bo pilgrim s family to transfer enough pilgrim s pride stock so that we cease to qualify as a family corporation 
however  this may happen  and the suspense account might be required to be included in our taxable income 
potential accrual of deferred taxes may affect our net income and cash flow 
the company has not provided any deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its mexico subsidiaries based upon its determination that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested 
as of september   the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately million 
if such earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us and foreign income taxes would have been provided  after consideration of estimated foreign tax credits 
however  determination of the amount of deferred federal and foreign income taxes is not practical 
significant competition 
competition in the chicken and turkey industries with other vertically integrated poultry companies  especially companies with greater resources  may make us unable to compete successfully in these industries  which could adversely affect our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
in both the united states and mexico  we primarily compete with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us poultry industry include price  product quality  brand identification  breadth of product line  and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that competition is based on product quality  brand awareness and customer service 
further  there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the us prepared food business 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
additionally  the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   requires annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  as those tariffs are reduced  increased competition from chicken imported into mexico from the us may have a material adverse effect on the mexican chicken industry in general  and on our mexican operations in particular
