during this period  the company introduced a knee laxity measurement device  a diagnostic tool for measuring posture  scoliosis and back flexibility  and a surgical guidance device utilizing a six axis articulated arm 
in  in an effort to capitalize on a demand for d portable measurement tools for the factory floor  the company made a strategic decision to target its core measurement technology to the manufacturing and industrial markets 
in order to focus on manufacturing and industrial applications of its technology  the company phased out the direct sale of its medical products and entered into licensing agreements with two major neurosurgical companies for its medical technology 
since  the company has entered into additional licensing agreements for the use of its technology for medical applications

smx s previous generation laser tracker  which was introduced in  was sold until september smx halted production and sale of its earlier generation laser tracker in september as part of a settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit

critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our most subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on the company s financial condition 
the two accounting estimation processes discussed below are the company s process of recognizing research and development expenditures  and the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
these estimation processes affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of the company 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
research and development costs incurred in the discovery of new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge into plans and designs for new products  prior to the attainment of the related products technological feasibility  are recorded as expenses in the period incurred 
product design costs incurred in the development of products after technological feasibility is attained are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the related products  not to exceed years 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when the company has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish design specifications including function  features and technical performance requirements 
capitalization of product design costs ceases and amortization of such costs begins when the product is available for general release to customers 
the company periodically assesses the value of capitalized product design costs and records a reserve for obsolescence or impairment when  in certain circumstances including the discontinuance or probable discontinuance of the related products from the market  it deems the asset to be obsolete or impaired 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is used to state the company s inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
since the amount of inventoriable cost that the company will truly recoup through sales cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
inventory is considered as obsolete if the company has withdrawn it from the market or if the company has had no sales of the product for the past months nor sales forecasted for the next months  therefore a reserve in an amount equal to of the average cost of such inventory is recorded 
the company classifies as slow moving inventory with quantities of on hand greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months  and reserve such amount as is adequate to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
during  and  the provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory was   and  respectively 
transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters from xenon research  inc xenon  all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by simon raab  the company s president and chief executive officer  and diana raab  his spouse 
the term of the lease expires on february   and the company has two five year renewal options 
base rent under the lease was  for base rent during renewal periods will reflect changes in the us bureau of labor statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers 
in june  the company and each of the former cats shareholders entered into an amended and restated loan agreement pursuant to which the company granted loans to the former cats shareholders in the aggregate amount of million the loans 
the loans are for a term of three years  at an interest rate of approximately  and grant the borrowers an option to extend the term for an additional three years 
as collateral for the loans  the former cats shareholders pledged to the company  shares of the company s common stock 
the loans are a non recourse obligation of the former cats shareholders 
the company engaged cole partners  a mergers and acquisition and corporate finance advisory service firm  to serve as the company s financial advisor in connection with the company s acquisition in january  of spatialmetrix  inc smx 
stephen r 
cole  one of the company s directors and member of the audit committee  is the founding partner and president of cole partners 
the company paid to cole partners total fees of approximately  by early for its services in the smx acquisition 
foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  the majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase further 
see additional discussion under impact of recently issued accounting standards below 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in conversion to the euro currency on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro ends june  in connection therewith  in january certain member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency 
issues facing the company as a result of the introduction of the euro include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  amending lease agreements and other contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
the company is addressing these issues and does not expect the adoption of the euro to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

in january  the company adopted fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas requires companies to recognize all their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of position 
in august  the company entered into a foreign exchange rate swap allowing the company the right to purchase up to million at a base rate of euros per 
under the agreement  the company and the bank are to compensate one another based on the exchange rate agreement differential at specified measurement dates 
this foreign exchange rate agreement does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment  as it does not meet the specified criteria under sfas therefore the changes in fair value are included in the determination of earnings 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
