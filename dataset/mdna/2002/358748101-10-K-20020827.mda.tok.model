diluted eps 
in conformity with discontinued operations accounting standards  provision for depreciation expense on the hotel properties was suspended when divestiture plans were announced in march  depreciation expense related to hotel assets was zero in fiscal and was  in fiscal results of operations the discussion of results of operations compares the results of operations of fiscal with the comparable results from continuing operations excludes all hotel transactions for fiscal and fiscal sales revenue consists principally of retail sales to the customers of big boy and golden corral restaurants 
retail sales patterns and customer traffic may increase or decrease in existing restaurants due to a variety of reasons including changes in the menu mix  customers perception of value and changes in neighborhood demographics 
changes in sales revenue also occur when new restaurants are opened  older restaurants are permanently closed and menu prices are increased 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other operators  which amounted to less than percent of total revenue in all three years 
same store sales in big boy restaurants improved by percent during fiscal  including a percent rise for the fourth quarter  marking the nineteenth consecutive quarter that big boy same store sales gains have been achieved 
big boy same store sales increases were percent in fiscal and were percent in fiscal the extra week contained in fiscal was excluded in calculating the percentage increase of all same store sales 
higher customer counts drove the sales increases during the latter half of the year  aided by mild winter weather and the slower economy that brings cost conscious diners to big boy instead of higher priced full service establishments 
strong carryout and drive thru trade continued to outpace the increase in dining room sales during fiscal  but the margin narrowed significantly when compared to the prior two years 
a combination of new menu items and menu price hikes also helped to drive the increases in all three years 
during fiscal  menu prices were increased percent near the end of the first quarter and just under percent near the end of the third quarter 
price increases similar in size to fiscal were implemented during the corresponding periods in fiscal a menu price increase of percent was implemented in september  and a similar increase was made in february  another menu price increase is currently being planned for the autumn of average annual sales volume of a big boy restaurant reached  in fiscal  up from  comparable week basis in fiscal and  in fiscal since the beginning of fiscal  four new big boy restaurants have been opened  one of which was a replacement building on the same land  while three older  under performing restaurants were permanently closed 
no big boy restaurants were opened or closed during fiscal no new big boy restaurants are expected to open during fiscal  although one replacement building is currently under construction 
sales from golden corral restaurants were  during fiscal  an increase of  or percent higher than fiscal  and  higher than two years ago 
as new restaurants open  an initial burst of curiosity sales is usually experienced as the general public is eager to try out the new restaurant 
this honeymoon period typically lasts several months before the restaurant s sales reach normalized levels 
in a period of rapid growth such as the company has experienced the last three years in developing golden corrals  year over year comparisons frequently are not meaningful 
eleven golden corrals were in operation throughout fiscal  including one that opened on the first day of fiscal a total of sixteen golden corrals were operating at the end of fiscal five golden corrals were in operation for all of fiscal a total of ten golden corrals were operating at the end of fiscal only one golden corral was in operation for the full fiscal  while four were added during the year 
average annual sales volume for restaurants in operation throughout fiscal was  per restaurant 
three to four more golden corrals will add sales revenue in fiscal  including two that opened respectively in june and july of a percent price increase was implemented in february of with a 
percent increase in february  the great steak buffet will be introduced in all golden corral restaurants during the first quarter of fiscal the concept features all you can eat charbroiled steaks  allowing a higher price point to be charged 
higher sales  profits and cash flows are expected to be achieved from this initiative 
as of june   the company had licensed big boy restaurants to other operators compared with such restaurants at the start of fiscal other revenue is normally comprised principally of franchise and other service fees earned from these licensed restaurants 
in addition  other revenue for fiscal included  from the sale of unused big boy territorial rights in areas that had been abandoned by the company years ago 
cost of sales for fiscal increased  or percent higher than fiscal  roughly proportionate to the percent revenue increase percent increase excluding last year s revenue from the sale of territorial franchise rights 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal percent without benefit of the non recurring revenue from the sale of territorial franchise rights and percent in fiscal an analysis of the components of cost of sales follows 
as a percentage of big boy sales  food and papercosts in big boy restaurants were percent  percent and percent  respectively  during fiscal years  and food cost percentages for big boy restaurants benefited in all three years from higher sales of carryout and drive thru meals  which usually have lower food cost percentages than a typical dinner served in the dining room 
menu price hikes in all three years have also helped to keep the percentages in line despite higher costs of certain commodities  especially beef  cheese and other dairy products 
the cost of these commodities began to recede during the latter half of fiscal resulting in the food cost percentage 
food cost in golden corral restaurants  which as a percentage of sales is much higher than in big boy restaurants  continues to drive consolidated food and paper costs higher as more golden corrals open 
the consolidated food cost percentage rose to percent of revenue during fiscal  up from percent percent without benefit of the non recurring revenue from the sale of territorial franchise rights and percent  respectively  during fiscal years and although not critical to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition or its results of operations  the assumptions used to measure reserves for self insurance can be complex and sometimes require management to exercise considerable judgment 
favorable claims experience allowed self insurance reserve estimates to be lowered by  and  respectively  in fiscal and unfavorable claims experience in fiscal resulted in raising reserve estimates by  with a corresponding charge taken to earnings 
payroll and related expenses were percent  percent and percent of revenue  respectively  during fiscal years  and without the adjustments in estimates of self insurance reserves apportioned to payroll and related expenses  fiscal would have remained at percent of revenue while fiscal would have been percent of revenue percent without benefit of the non recurring revenue from the sale of territorial franchise rights  and fiscal would have been percent of revenue 
although pay rates stabilized and began to recede during fiscal  several other factors accounted for the fiscal increase in the payroll and related percentage when compared with the prior two years 
first  an increase in service hours worked in relation to hours of operation added to higher payroll costs 
second  variable compensation for restaurant management earned was much greater than levels paid in the prior two years 
third  higher costs for pension and medical plan coverage were incurred during the year 
two other factors kept this year s payroll and related percentage from rising higher than it did 
first  the costs of certain other employee benefits are fixed and do not necessarily rise with higher levels of pay or higher sales levels 
second  payroll and related expense percentages for golden corral restaurants are lower than for big boy restaurants 
therefore  as more golden corral restaurants are opened  the percentage impact of overall payroll and related costs is lessened 
even though golden corral restaurants enjoy a lower payroll and related expense percentage than do big boy restaurants  the company believes there is room for improvement and will focus on lowering golden corral payroll costs in fiscal the fair value of the assets in pension plans sponsored by the company has been adversely affected by poor investment results in the stock market  which has increased the company s pension expense after many years of steady  low costs 
the net periodic pension cost benefit was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the net periodic pension cost for fiscal is expected to be more than double that of fiscal federal legislation has once again been introduced that calls for raising the minimum wage 
if enacted  the legislation would raise the minimum wage by per hour in three stages over a period of about months to within days of enactment  to on january  and on january  the company estimates the first stage would have little immediate material impact 
the second and third stages could each add as much as a percentage point or more to consolidated payroll and related expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue 
higher menu prices together with tighter payroll standards  reducing the number of hours worked for a given sales level  would likely be used to offset the pressure brought from a higher minimum wage 
other operating costs include occupancy costs  depreciation  utilities  opening expenses and various other restaurant operating costs 
these expenses were percent of revenue during fiscal  compared with percent percent without benefit of the non recurring revenue from the sale of territorial franchise rights during fiscal and were percent in fiscal as these expenses tend to be more fixed in nature  sales increases from higher customer traffic and menu price hikes generally cause these costs to be a lower percentage of revenue 
significant charges for new restaurant opening costs were incurred in all three years 
opening expenses for golden corral restaurants were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and opening expenses for big boy restaurants were   and zero  respectively  in fiscal years  and results for fiscal were adversely affected by impairment of long lived assets charges totaling  that resulted from closing two unprofitable big boy restaurants during that year 
administrative and advertising expense during fiscal increased  or percent higher than fiscal  and was  or percent higher than fiscal the largest component of the increases is higher spending for big boy and golden corral advertising and marketing  which is proportionate with higher sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of sales on advertising and marketing 
golden corral sales volume in fiscal reached the economy of scale necessary for television advertising  which began in the cincinnati market during the year 
golden corral tv spots are expected to be expanded during fiscal when compared with fiscal  other components of the fiscal and fiscal increase include higher corporate bonus accruals commensurate with continued improvements in earnings 
interest expense during fiscal decreased  or percent lower than fiscal and was  higher than fiscal three factors contributed heavily to the fiscal reduction in spite of much higher outstanding debt levels at the end of the year higher levels of capitalized interest during active construction periods  much lower variable interest rates and a lower level of debt to begin the year principally because proceeds from the sales of the hotel properties were used to repay debt last year 
interest expense should increase over the long term even though borrowing levels are expected to slow substantially in fiscal because the full effect of having borrowed  in fiscal will be felt and because variable rates are more likely to rise than fall 
income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent for fiscal  compared with percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal these rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of tax credits  principally the federal credits allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the work opportunity credit 
critical accounting policies two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes that its policy used in accounting for the impairment of long lived assets is the company s only critical accounting policy because of its potential for significant impact on financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of this policy can be found under the property and equipment caption of note b to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company historically maintains a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
since substantially all of the company s retail sales are cash or credit card sales  management believes that the  working capital deficit as of june  does not and will not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire its obligations when due 
operating cash flows were  in fiscal in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows were utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion  dividends  and repurchases of the company s common stock 
unsecured credit lines are readily available when needed to help finance capital projects 
investing activities in fiscal included  in capital costs 
this includes  for golden corral restaurants  principally for new restaurant construction and site acquisitions  and  for big boy restaurants which includes new restaurant construction  site acquisitions  remodeling existing restaurants  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
remaining expenditures to complete new restaurant construction that was in progress as of june  are estimated at  for golden corrals and  for one big boy restaurant 
it is the company s policy to own its restaurant properties  however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
two ground leases for golden corral restaurants were entered into during fiscal these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
no significant property sales occurred during fiscal substantially all of the  in proceeds from property sales in fiscal were from the sale of the two hotel properties  most of which was immediately used to repay debt until needed for restaurant expansion 
proceeds from property sales are normally used for working capital 
financing activities in fiscal included  of new debt borrowed against the company s credit lines 
payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  regular quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled  the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends 
since october   the company has had a stock repurchase program 
the program was most recently renewed in october  a total of  shares were acquired at a cost of  during fiscal a total of  shares remain available to be repurchased before the current program expires in october  due to the strong upward movement in the stock price since december   no shares have been acquired since january  and the company has no current plans to make any further repurchases of its stock 
proceeds of  were received during the year from employees and directors of the company who acquired  shares of the company s common stock through exercise of stock options 
expansion costs are being funded through a combination of cash flow and the company s credit facilities that provide for unsecured borrowing of up to  as of june    had been cumulatively borrowed leaving  available to be drawn upon before the availability of draws is scheduled to expire on september  decisions to slow golden corral and big boy expansion plans were made during the latter half of fiscal to allow better use of cash flows from operations while minimizing the use of credit lines 
the company s development agreements with golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor were slightly modified in january  to allow the company to more evenly spread the development schedule over the remaining term of the agreement 
the company still plans to open golden corral restaurants by december  plans for fiscal call for three to four golden corrals to open  including two that opened respectively in june and july of three more should be under active construction at the end of fiscal on average  the cost to build and equip each golden corral restaurant is approximately  including land 
the cost to retrofit all existing golden corrals for the great steak buffet will run approximately  substantially all of which will be expended before the end of the first quarter of fiscal the construction of a golden corral restaurant in canton  ohio  which had been expected to open in september   was halted in august  when structural defects were discovered 
in march   a final assessment of the scope of the defects resulted in the company s decision to construct a new building on another part of the lot 
the company intends to assert claims against various firms with which the company had contracted for the design  engineering and construction of the defective building 
the company expects to recover at least  in expenditures incurred to date 
construction of the new building is expected to begin during the summer of construction of a new big boy restaurant to replace an older building on existing land was begun in may  the cost to build and equip the restaurant is currently estimated at  this restaurant will likely be the last big boy restaurant to be built that fully utilizes the building prototype that was introduced last year 
a more cost effective derivative of the prototype will be developed  the first of which is expected to be under construction by the end of fiscal land acquisitions will likely continue during fiscal the company routinely renovates approximately one fifth of its big boy restaurants each year  the estimated cost of which for fiscal totals approximately  certain high volume big boy restaurants will be evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  the company is currently making plans to replace its headquarters legacy information systems with an integrated enterprise system 
the installation of the system will be a long term process that could take one to three years to fully install 
the total cost to install such a system has yet to be determined as the vendor to supply the new system has yet to be selected 
however  as much as  could be expended during fiscal risk factors and safe harbor statement statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that item is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements can generally be identified in sentences that contain words such as should  could  will  may  plan  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  intend  believe and similar words that are used to convey the fact that the statement being made is prospective and does not strictly relate to historical or present facts 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements that may be contained in this md a 
food safety is the most significant risk to any company that operates in the restaurant industry 
it has become the focus of increased government regulatory initiatives at the local  state and federal levels resulting in higher compliance costs to the company 
to limit the company s exposure to the risk of food contamination  management rigorously emphasizes and enforces the company s food safety policies working cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of government authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to receive re certification in servsafe training every five years 
other examples of risks and uncertainties facing the company include  but are not limited to  the following intense competition for customers  consumer perceptions of value  food quality and quality of service  changing consumer preferences  changing neighborhood demographics  changes in business strategy and development plans  the rising cost of quality sites on which to build restaurants  incorrect restaurant site selection  the effects of inflationary pressure  including higher energy prices  rolling power outages  shortages of qualified labor  changes in the supply and cost of food  seasonal weather conditions  particularly during the winter months of the third quarter  natural disasters  fires or explosions  criminal acts  including bomb threats  robberies  hostage taking  kidnapping and other violent crimes  acts of terrorists or acts of war  civil disturbances  boycotts  variable interest rates  limitations on borrowing capacity  legal claims  changes in accounting standards  estimates used in preparing financial statements  disruptions to the business during transitions to new computer software  financial stability of technology vendors to support computer software over the long term  changes in governmental regulations regarding the environment  exposure to penalties for potential violations of numerous governmental regulations in general  and immigration i and minor labor regulations in particular  any future imposition by osha of costly ergonomics regulations on workplace safety  legislative changes affecting labor law  especially increases in the federal minimum wage  and legislative or court rulings that result in changes to tax codes 
the company continually takes reasonable preventive measures to reduce its risks and uncertainties 
however  the nature of some risks and uncertainties leaves the company with little control 
the materialization of any of the risks and uncertainties identified herein  together with those risks not specifically listed or those that are presently unforeseen  could result in significant adverse effects on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  which could include the permanent closure of the affected restaurant s with an impairment of assets charge taken against earnings 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has market risk exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to its  revolving credit loan  all of which is presently outstanding 
interest rates are determined by a pricing matrix that uses various margins that are added to the london interbank offered rate libor or a money market based rate  or are subtracted from the prime rate 
the margins are determined by the ratio of bank debt to earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use foreign currency 
food supplies for big boy restaurants are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers 
quality and price are the principal determinants of source 
centralized purchasing and food preparation through the company s commissary ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and results in lower food and supply costs 
certain commodities  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
for golden corral restaurants  the company currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items from the same vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor uses for its operations 
deliveries are made two or three times per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications should the company wish or need to make a change
