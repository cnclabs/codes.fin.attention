novell provides worldwide channel  consulting  education and developer programs to support its offerings 
the company markets its products and services through us and international sales offices 
the company licenses its products through site license agreements that are either sold directly by novell  or service providers and software distribution channel partners 
the company also distributes licenses as packaged software products that are resold by systems integrators and other value added resellers 
in addition  novell products are licensed to original equipment manufacturers 
changes in the economic and business environment for network software and consulting services have occurred in the last several years  which have led to strategic and operational changes at novell 
the company has evolved its business to focus on ebusiness solutions and net services software applications  which support highly distributed network solutions and capitalize on the growth of the internet 
novell has expanded its net services offerings around open internet standards and its own edirectory tm network infrastructure products

on july   the company acquired cambridge technology partners massachusetts  inc cambridge  a technology consulting company focused on helping its customers develop and accelerate their transition to ebusiness solutions and processes 
the acquisition of cambridge helped support the company s strategy of providing a foundation for e business with novell net services software and edirectory products 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
the company s it consulting services business derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized on percentage of completion  using the time to completion method to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the novell annual report planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
the company records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company s long lived assets include long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
at october   the company had million of long term investments  million of goodwill and other intangible assets  and million of net deferred tax assets  current and non current  accounting for approximately of the company s total assets 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependant on the performance of the companies or venture funds in which the company has invested  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of its investees 
if these forecasts are not met the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during the year ended october   the company recognized million of impairment losses related to its long term investments 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on november  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended october   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
during the year ended october   the company recorded million of valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets 
results of operations acquisition on july   the shareholders of cambridge approved the acquisition of cambridge by novell

consulting  support services  and education revenues were of total revenue in fiscal compared to of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal the company previously recognized revenue related to product sales to distribution channel partners upon shipment to the partner and provided a reserve for contractual return obligations and other estimated product returns

subsequent events on december   the company completed the sale of its  square foot office building in herndon  virginia for million cash resulting in a net gain of approximately million 
novell currently occupies approximately  square feet for sales offices and leases this space from the new owners of the building 
on december   the company formed a venture capital fund  novell technology capital fund i  lp ntc i and related entities that include novell technology cgp  inc cgp and novell technology gplp i  lp gplp 
gplp is the general partner of ntc i  which has limited partners including novell  directly  and several novell employees including two executive officers of novell  and co managing directors of ntc i  who are directly involved in the management and operation of both ntc i and cambridge technology capital fund i lp  novell s venture capital fund acquired with cambridge 
novell has committed up to million in capital to ntc i  with an initial commitment of and funding of million as part of the first closing on december  ntc i is in the process of seeking additional outside institutional investors 
financial and operating results of ntc i and related entities will be consolidated in novell s financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal risk factors affecting future results of operations the company s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results are the following business conditions and the general economy  competitive factors  such as rival operating systems  directories and applications  acceptance of new products and services and price pressures  availability of third party compatible products at below market prices  risk of nonpayment of accounts or notes receivable  risks associated with foreign operations  risk of product line or inventory obsolescence due to shifts in technologies novell annual report or market demand  timing of software product introductions  market fluctuations of investment securities  and litigation 
other factors may also adversely affect the company s earnings and stock price  including but not limited to competition for qualified employees competition from other product and service companies delays in the introduction of new products success of new products or technologies stock market fluctuations unrelated to company performance failure to properly estimate costs of fixed fee engagements failure to properly manage consulting engagements within fees agreed to by customers the current economic climate and outlook in the technology and information technology services sector is very weak the weakened economic climate  particularly in the technology sector  has had an adverse effect on novell s stock price and operations 
future economic projections for this sector do not anticipate a quick recovery 
a continuation of the weakened economy could have further negative effects on the company s stock price and operations in the future 
our financial results may vary the company often experiences a higher volume of sales at the end of each quarter and during the company s fourth quarter 
because of this  fixed costs that are out of line with sales levels may not be detected until late in any given quarter and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating results have been  and may also be affected  by other factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers product mix  including a shift from higher margin to lower margin products or services delays or problems with our fulfillment agents impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations inability to respond to the decline in sales through the distribution channel inability to derive benefits from the restructuring and new corporate strategy inability to deliver solutions as expected by our consulting customers differences in estimates versus actual results we compete in a challenging market for computer software and consulting services novell competes in a highly challenging market for computer software 
one pervasive factor underlying all of the company s business endeavors is the presence of microsoft in all sectors of the software business  and microsoft s dominance in many of those sectors 
in a finding upheld by the circuit court for the district of columbia  the united states district court found that microsoft violated section of the sherman act by unlawfully acting to maintain its monopoly novell annual report over desktop operating systems 
the company believes that microsoft is exploiting its desktop operating monopoly in a way that is designed to extend its market power into the market for server operating systems  and to claim control of network and web services such as authentication  using many of the same anti competitive practices found by the united states district court to be in violation of the nation s anti trust laws 
the company is concerned that the revised proposed final judgment of the litigation between the department of justice and microsoft will not benefit competition or consumers in a meaningful way and  if approved  could result in continued harm to the company 
additionally  the company does not have the product breadth and market power of microsoft 
microsoft s ability to ship networking products with features and functionality that compete with novell s  together with its ability to offer incentives to customers to purchase certain products in order to obtain favorable sales terms or necessary compatibility or information with respect to other products  may significantly inhibit novell s ability to grow its business 
microsoft has significant financial resources  which could allow it to aggressively price its products and services for long periods of time to the potential detriment of competitors 
microsoft in the past has also employed tactics that limit or block effective and efficient interoperability with novell s products 
microsoft frequently bundles software features into its operating system for free which compete directly with stand alone products from novell 
as microsoft creates new operating systems and applications  there can be no assurance that novell will be able to ensure that its products will be compatible with those of microsoft 
although these market conditions and the judgments reached in litigation concerning microsoft may affect overall novell performance  the company believes its strong product offering and one net business strategy will be competitive in the marketplace 
additionally  if the more meaningful relief being sought by the nine litigating states is imposed on microsoft  there could be a restoration of competition in the marketplace that would benefit novell 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive due to such factors as the existence of several large consulting firms specializing in the information systems area such as compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  ibm  accenture  cap gemini and the three remaining consulting arms of the big five accounting firms 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the consulting area  which could inhibit the company s ability to grow its consulting business 
additionally  the company may face competition from other industry companies  which could introduce competitive products and or services 
if any of these competing products or services achieves market acceptance  novell s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
novell believes that additional factors that affect success in the marketplace include technical innovation to meet dynamic market needs  marketing strength  system performance  customer service and support  reliability  ease of use  security  and price compared to performance 
novell seeks to address all of these factors with its marketing and product development 
however  these factors are also addressed by competitors  including microsoft  in ways that may cause novell s chances of success to be diminished 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel in the computer and consulting industries the ability of the company to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified development  consulting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there is a risk of departure due to the competitive environment in the software and consulting industries 
the loss of a significant group of key personnel would adversely affect the company s performance 
the failure to successfully promote and hire suitable replacements in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
novell annual report we depend on a number of key executives who have recently joined us and whom we may not be able to retain most members of our senior management have recently joined us 
many of these individuals have not previously worked with one another  and it will take time for the management team to become integrated and work effectively together 
it may also take time for these individuals to effect change within the organizations that lie within their respective areas of responsibility 
due to the competitive nature of our industry  we may not be able to retain all of our senior managers 
although our acquisition of cambridge was intended to result in benefits to the combined company  those benefits may not be realized 
additionally  neither novell nor cambridge is experienced in organizing an integration of businesses of this complexity and scale achieving the benefits of the cambridge acquisition will depend in part on the successful integration of personnel  operations and technology 
the integration of the two companies has been and will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may continue to disrupt novell s business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following obtaining synergies from the companies professional services organizations  obtaining synergies from the companies service and product offerings effectively and quickly  coordinating sales efforts so that customers can do business easily with the combined company  integrating technology  back office  human resources  accounting and financial systems  bringing together marketing efforts so that the market receives useful information about the combined company  assimilating our employees into a common business culture  and retaining key officers and employees who possess the necessary skills and experience to quickly and effectively transition and integrate the businesses 
neither novell nor cambridge has experience in integrating operations on the complexity and scale presented by the merger 
the integration process has been and will continue to be complicated and has been and will continue to involve a number of special risks and challenges  including the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business operations 
it is not certain that novell and cambridge can be successfully integrated in a timely manner or that the anticipated benefits will be realized 
failure to effectively complete the integration could materially harm the business and operating results of the combined company 
in addition  goodwill related to the acquisition of cambridge could become impaired 
we have experienced delays in the introduction and acceptance of new products due to various factors as is common in the computer software industry  novell has  in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to a number of factors  including the complexity of software products  the need for extensive testing of software to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application software and hardware devices  and the need to debug products prior to extensive distribution 
significant delays in developing  completing or shipping new or enhanced products would adversely affect the company 
moreover  the company may experience delays in market acceptance of new releases of its products as the company engages in marketing and education of the user base regarding the advantages and system requirements for new products and as customers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading 
the company has encountered these issues on each major new release of its products  and expects that it will encounter such issues in the future 
novell s ability to achieve desired levels of sales growth depends at least in part on the successful completion  introduction and sale of new versions of its products 
there can be no novell annual report assurance that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others  or that the company s research and development efforts will be successful 
should novell experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to new product releases  the company s sales and net income could be adversely affected 
if third parties claim that we infringed upon their intellectual property  our ability to use some technologies and products could be limited and we may incur significant costs to resolve these claims litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
novell expects third party infringement claims involving internet technologies and software products and services to increase 
if an infringement claim is filed against novell  it may be prevented from using some technologies and may incur significant costs to resolve the claim 
novell has in the past received letters suggesting that it is infringing upon the intellectual rights of others  and it may from time to time encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
novell s products and services may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  novell has agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify customers against claims that its products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
novell could incur substantial costs in defending itself and its customers against infringement claims 
in the event of a claim of infringement  novell and its customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
in such instances  novell or its customers may not be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all 
we may not be able to protect our confidential information  which may adversely affect our business the company generally enters into contractual relationships with its employees that protect its confidential information 
in the event that the company s trade secrets or other proprietary information are misappropriated  the company s business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  the company may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use of its intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce its rights 
in the event the company is unable to enforce these contractual obligations  its business could be adversely affected 
we may not be successful at introducing new technologies one goal of the company is to achieve widespread acceptance and adoption of novell s net services and e solutions products  directory services nds  and the products and applications that take advantage of directory services 
the company s ability to achieve success with its net services and nds solutions is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following development of key net services and directory products and upgrades  the acceptance of those products by large industry partners  the marketing of those products through appropriate channels of distribution  and the acceptance of those products in major accounts 
the company has only had limited success in introducing new technologies and there can be no assurance of success with net services or nds solutions 
our existing product sales may deteriorate more rapidly than sales of our new products increase the company has several existing products  which it has been selling and upgrading for many years 
technology shifts or competition could occur causing sales of these products to decline at a faster rate than the company is able to increase sales of new products or technologies 
although revenues from net directory services and net content services increased during fiscal  revenues from net management services decreased by  resulting in overall declines in net sales by in fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal novell annual report we face increased risks in conducting a global business  which may damage business results novell is a multi national corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world and  as such  it faces risks in doing business abroad that it does not face domestically 
certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact the operating results of the company  including costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  local political and economic conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
some of our short term  long term  and venture capital fund investments have become impaired 
additional investments could become impaired novell s investment portfolio includes investments in public equity securities  small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  and funds managed by venture capitalists 
many of these investments might become other than temporarily impaired 
during its fiscal year  novell recorded an impairment charge of million related to some of the investments in its portfolio whose market value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
as of october   the company had net unrealized gains  net of taxes  on investments totaling approximately million  however  there can be no assurances that these gains will be realized and that losses will not occur 
our existing relationships with other information technology services organizations may be impaired novell relies on existing relationships with information technology services organizations that recommend  design and implement solutions for their customers ebusiness that include novell net services products 
a change in the willingness of these information technology service organizations to do business with novell could undercut novell s efforts to become a solutions based net services software company 
our business may be negatively affected if we do not continue to adapt to rapid technological change  evolving business practices and changing consumer requirements the software industry and internet professional services market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving business practices and changing client needs 
accordingly  novell s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to adapt and meet these challenges 
among the most important challenges facing the company are the need to continue to effectively identify and use leading technologies  develop strategic and technical expertise  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technology changes and to orient management teams to capitalize on these changes  recruit and retain qualified project personnel  novell annual report enhance current services  develop new services that meet changing customer needs  and effectively advertise and market services 
our services contracts contain pricing risks novell s cambridge it services business derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
because of the complex nature of the services provided  it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the cost  scope and duration of particular client engagements 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required for a project  does not accurately assess the scope of work associated with a project  does not manage the project properly  or does not satisfy its obligations in a manner consistent with the contract  then the company s costs to complete the project could increase substantially 
the company has occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and it may have to take similar action in the future 
the company may not be compensated for these additional costs or the commitment of these additional resources 
our cambridge it services clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice if the company s clients cancel or reduce the scope of an engagement with the cambridge it services business  the company may be unable to reassign its professionals to new engagements without delay 
personnel and related costs constitute a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses 
because these expenses are relatively fixed  and because the company establishes the levels of these expenses well in advance of any particular quarter  cancellations or reductions in the scope of client engagements could result in the under utilization of the company s professional services employees  causing significant reductions in operating results for a particular quarter 
our stock price will fluctuate the company s future earnings and stock price could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth  any such shortfall in earnings can be expected to have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of novell s common stock in any given period

these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
novell annual report item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  the company utilizes currency forward contracts and currency options 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of the company s short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately million decrease approximately in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
market risk the company also holds available for sale equity securities in its short term investment portfolio 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately million decrease in the fair value of the company s short term investments 
as of october   the company had net unrealized gains on short term public equity securities totaling million 
in addition  the company invests in equity  securities  included in its long term portfolio of investments  for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  both public and private 
because of the nature of these investments  the company is exposed to equity price risks 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in approximately million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale long term securities 
foreign currency risk the company hedges currency risks of investments denominated in foreign currencies with currency forward contracts when hedging is deemed to be available and beneficial 
foreign currency gains and losses on these foreign currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to the company 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and certain other asian and european currencies 
the company generally does not use any derivative instruments for trading purposes and did not utilize any such instruments during the year 
the company  however  does utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and we hedge certain residual exposures through the use of one month forward contracts 
due to the short period of time between entering into the forward contracts and the year end  the fair value of the derivatives as of october  is insignificant and accordingly did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if the company did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately million  net of existing hedges 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
