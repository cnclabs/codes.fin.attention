critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products and when title passes 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  the company accrues estimated warranty expenses 
estimated warranty expenses are recorded on product revenues and adjusted periodically based on historical and anticipated experience 
the company has undertaken projects  which include the development and construction of large complex cargo inspection systems requiring installation and customization at the customer s site 
sales under such long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful 
table of contents accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands for the next to months  market conditions and customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties 
if these factors are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of past and current evidence including  among other things  historical earnings  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce net income and would establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks  which are inherent in the company s financial instruments and arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce market risk in connection with specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its short term borrowings under its bank lines of credit 
borrowings under these lines of credit do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings have short maturities and are borrowed at variable interest rates 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
foreign currency the accounts of the company s operations in singapore  malaysia  england  finland  norway and canada are maintained in singapore dollars  malaysian ringgits  uk pounds sterling  euro  norwegian kroner and canadian dollars  respectively 
foreign currency financial statements are translated into us dollars at current rates  with the exception of revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average rates during the reporting period 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income  while those resulting from translation of financial statements are excluded from income and accumulated as a component of shareholder s equity 
transaction losses of approximately  and  were included in income for fiscal and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at june   would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s use of derivatives consists primarily of foreign exchange contracts and an interest rate swap 
the company purchases forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure related to commitments to acquire inventory for sale 
the company does not use the contracts for trading purposes 
as of june   the company had five foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million to hedge foreign exchange exposure on accounts receivables and accounts payable in malaysia in the event of possible change in monetary policy in malaysia relating to the pegging of malaysian ringgit to the us dollar 
since the monetary policy remained unchanged and the malaysian ringgit is still pegged to the us dollar  the forward exchange contract has no fair value as of june  these contracts expire in december 
table of contents importance of international markets international markets provide the company with significant growth opportunities 
however  the following events  among others  could adversely affect the company s financial results in subsequent periods periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world  changes in trade policies or tariffs  and political instability 
for the year ended june   overall foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar had an immaterial effect on the company s consolidated revenues and results of operations 
as a result of monetary policy in malaysia  including the pegging of the malaysian ringgit to the us dollar  the company believes that its foreign currency exposure in malaysia will not be significant in the foreseeable future 
the company continues to perform ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and  if deemed necessary  the company requires advance payments for sales 
the company is monitoring economic and currency conditions around the world to evaluate whether there may be any significant effect on its international sales in the future 
due to its overseas investments and the necessity of dealing with local currencies in its foreign business transactions  the company is at risk with respect to foreign currency fluctuations 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
interest rate risk all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalent and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
short term investments are comprised of high quality marketable securities 
we have not historically used derivatives to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  during the current fiscal year we entered into a interest rate swap to convert a portion of the company s variable interest rate debt to a fixed rate liability 
a hypothetical charge in the interest rates at june   related to the company s debt would not have a material impact on the company s position or results of operations 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of june  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair value investments cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term debt secured long term loan average interest rate the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of june  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair value investments cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term debt secured long term loan average interest rate 
table of contents during the current year  the company also entered into an interest rate swap 
the terms of the swap are to convert a portion of the company s variable interest rate debt into a fixed rate liability 
at year end  the fair value of the swap was 
the decrease in the market value from the date of purchase of the swap to year end is recorded in oci  due to the swap meeting the criteria of an effective cash flow hedge 
the amount to be reclassified from oci in the next twelve months is not expected to be material 
risk factors investing in the company s common stock involves a significant degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report or incorporated by reference 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer  in which case the trading price of its common stock may decline 
risks related to the company s business fluctuations in the company s operating results may cause its stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which the company participate  the company cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause the company to adjust its operations 
a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to its significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the company s operating results 
factors that may affect the company s operating results and the market price of its common stock include demand for and market acceptance of the company s products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the company does business  adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which the company is particularly dependent  changes in the portions of the company s revenue represented by various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the company s competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  variations in the company s product mix  the timing and amount of the company s expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
the company faces aggressive competition in many areas of business 
if the company does not compete effectively  its business will be harmed 
the company encounters aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of its business 
in the optoelectronic device and subsystem market and in the medical diagnostic and imaging systems market  competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support  and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production 
in the security and inspection market  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and 
table of contents quality  the over all cost of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner 
the company anticipates that it may have to adjust prices of many of its products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the september terrorist attacks have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
the september terrorist attacks have created increased interest in the company s security and detection products  however  the company is uncertain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as anticipated 
additionally  it is uncertain what  if any  solutions will be adopted as a result of the terrorism and whether the company s products will be a part of the ultimate solution 
additionally  should company s products be considered as a part of the security solution  it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase its products may be made available 
these factors may adversely impact the company and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues are dependent on orders in the security and inspection products category  which has lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles 
sales of security and inspection products depend in significant part upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports  border crossing inspection sites and other security installations 
accordingly  a portion of the company s sales of security inspection and detection products is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  the company expends significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if the company fails to receive an order after expending such resources  that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company does not introduce new products in a timely manner  its products could become obsolete and its operating results would suffer 
the company sells many of its products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  the company s products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of the company s new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including its ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price the company s products competitively and manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate the company s offerings from its competitors offerings 
some of the company s products are used by its customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
the company therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of its customers products 
in developing any new product  the company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if the company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities  it may invest heavily in research and development of products that 
table of contents do not lead to significant revenue 
interruptions to the company s ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect its profitability 
the company purchases certain raw materials and subcomponents from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
purchase order terms range from three months to one year at fixed costs  but the company does not have guaranteed long term supply arrangements with its suppliers 
any material interruption in the company s ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may not be able to successfully implement its acquisition strategy  integrate acquired businesses into its existing business or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of the company s strategies is to supplement its internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment its existing product lines 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on its management  working capital and financial resources 
the company may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 
some of the businesses the company may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  the company must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
the company may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into its existing operations 
to finance the company s acquisitions  it may have to raise additional funds  through either public or private financings 
the company may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the company s sales 
in fiscal   and revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
of the revenues generated during fiscal from shipments made to customers outside of the united states  represented sales from the united states to foreign customers  and the balance represented sales generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
since the company sells its products worldwide  its businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
the company anticipates that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total revenue 
in addition  many of the company s manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  the company s future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  
table of contents differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
the company s failure to protect its intellectual property could impair its competitive position 
the company believes that its principal competitive strength is its ability to design  develop and manufacture complex optoelectronic devices and subsystems for various industry segments 
while the company owns certain patents and marks  other aspects of its business are not protected by patents or marks 
accordingly  there are no legal barriers that prevent potential competitors from copying certain of its products  processes and technologies or from otherwise entering into operations in direct competition with it 
the company s products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against it could be costly and prevent it from making or selling certain products 
third parties may seek to claim that the company s products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
the company may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect its proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against the company could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent it from making  using or selling its products in the us or abroad 
a claim for damages could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operation 
the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks  particularly with respect to its security and inspection products 
there are many factors beyond the company s control that could lead to liability claims  including the failure of the products in which its subsystems are installed  the reliability of the customers operators of the inspection equipment  and the maintenance of the inspection units by the customers 
there can be no assurance that the amount of product liability insurance that the company carry will be sufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
a product liability claim in excess of the amount of insurance the company carry could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
the company is dependent in its operations on the continued availability of the services of its employees  many of whom are individually key to its current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement its growth plans 
in particular  the company is dependent upon the services of deepak chopra  its chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
the company has entered into a year employment agreement with mr 
chopra  which expires april  and maintains a million policy of key man life insurance on the life of mr 
chopra 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while the company s compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  there can be no assurance that it will be able to retain the services of all of its key employees or a sufficient number to execute on its plans  nor can there be any assurances that it will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
the company s failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force it to modify its manufacturing process 

table of contents the company is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of its products 
under such laws  the company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in its facilities 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the company knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
any failure by the company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the company s products or increase its expenses 
the company compete in markets in which it or its customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety and food and drug regulations 
the company develops  configures and markets its products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the company s products 
risks related to the company s capital structure and common stock the company s officers and directors and stockholders affiliated with them own a large percentage of its voting stock 
as of september   the company s directors and executive officers including scope industries  an affiliate of one of the company s directors  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of its outstanding common stock 
consequently  scope industries  together with the company s directors and executive officers acting in concert  will have the ability to significantly affect the election of the company s directors and have a significant effect on the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
such concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
the company s articles of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
the company s articles of incorporation authorize its board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such series  and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by its shareholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of the company s common stock 
the company has no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock  and may limit the ability of such shareholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has in place a stockholder rights plan  adopted in  under which its stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of its preferred stock under certain circumstances 
these circumstances include the purchase of or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group  or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire or more of the outstanding common stock 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the company which could be beneficial to the stockholders 
the company s articles of incorporation limit the liability of its directors  which may limit the remedies that the company or its shareholders have available 

table of contents the company s articles of incorporation provide that  pursuant to the california corporations code  the liability of its directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under california law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by the company  or in its right  for breach of a director s duties to the company or its shareholders and may limit the remedies available to the company or its shareholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply to liabilities for i acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the company or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  iii any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit  iv acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the company or its shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware  or should have been aware  in the ordinary course of performing a director s duties  of a risk of serious injury to the company or its shareholders  v acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to the company or its shareholders  vi certain transactions or the approval of transactions in which a director has a material financial interest  and vii expressly imposed by statute for approval of certain improper distributions to shareholders or certain loans or guarantees
