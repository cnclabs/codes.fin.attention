item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring oil and gas properties and its ability to maintain or increase production through its exploitation and exploration activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the company s results

average us and canada oil prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the nymex reference price for oil 
the company s argentina oil production is sold at west texas intermediate spot prices as quoted on the platt s crude oil marketwire approximately equal to the nymex reference price less a specified differential 
the company s ecuador oil production is sold to various third party purchasers at west texas intermediate spot prices less a specified differential 
in  the company experienced a percent decrease in its average oil price  including the impact of hedging activities percent decrease excluding hedging activities  compared to the company experienced a percent increase in its average oil price  including the impact of hedging activities percent increase excluding hedging activities in compared to as a result of opec s efforts to reduce the available supply of crude oil in the global markets along with increasing demand 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  the argentine government took actions which in effect caused the devaluation of the peso in early december and  in january  enacted an emergency law that required certain contracts that were previously payable in us dollars to be payable in pesos 
subsequently  on february   the argentine government announced a percent tax on oil exports  effective march  the tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years 
for additional information  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and operations risk included elsewhere in this form k 
domestic argentina oil sales are now being paid in pesos  while export oil sales continue to be paid in us dollars 
the company currently exports approximately percent of its argentina oil production 
however  the company believes that this export tax will have the effect of decreasing all future argentina oil revenues not only export revenues by the tax rate for the duration of the tax 
the company believes the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentina oil sales now paid in pesos will move over time to parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax  thus impacting domestic argentina values by a like percentage to the tax 
the adverse impact of this tax will be partially offset by the net cost savings from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs and may be further reduced by the argentina income tax savings related to deducting such impact 
the company participated in oil hedges covering mmbbls  mmbbls and mmbbls in  and  respectively 
the impact of the hedges increased the company s us average oil price by cents to per bbl  its argentina average oil price by to per bbl and its overall average oil price by cents to per bbl 
the impact of the hedges decreased the company s us average oil price by to per bbl and its overall average oil price by to per bbl 
the impact of the hedges decreased the company s us average oil price by cents to per bbl and its overall average oil price by six cents to per bbl 
the company s realized average oil price for before hedges was approximately percent of the nymex reference price  compared to percent in and percent in average us gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in spot market prices  which may vary significantly by region  as evidenced by the significantly higher gas prices in california during the first half of due to the localized power shortage 
the company s canada gas is generally sold at spot market prices as reflected by the aeco gas price index 
the company s bolivia average gas price is tied to a long term contract under which the base price is adjusted for changes in specified fuel oil indexes 
the company s argentina average gas price was historically determined primarily by the realized oil price from the el huemul concession under a gas for oil exchange arrangement which expired at the end of beginning in  the company s argentina gas will be sold under spot contracts of varying lengths and  as a result of the emergency law enacted in january  must now be paid in pesos as a result of the emergency law enacted in january this will initially result in a decrease in sales revenue value when converted to us dollars due to the devaluation of the peso and current market conditions 
this value may improve over time as domestic argentina gas drilling declines and market conditions improve 
the company s total average gas price for was two percent higher than and was percent higher than the company has previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intends to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which it considers favorable 
the company has entered into various oil hedges swap agreements covering approximately mmbbls at a weighted average price of per bbl nymex reference price for various periods in the first half of the company has also entered into various gas hedges swap agreements covering approximately million mmbtu of its gas production over the period april through october the canadian portion of the gas swap agreements approximately million mmbtu is at the aeco gas price index reference price of canadian dollars per mmbtu and will be settled in canadian dollars 
the us portion of the gas swap agreements approximately million mmbtu is at a nymex reference price of per mmbtu 
additionally  the company has entered into basis swap agreements for the approximately million mmbtu of its us gas production covered by the gas swap agreements 
these basis swaps establish a differential between the nymex reference price and the various delivery points at levels that are comparable to the historical differentials received by the company 
for additional information  see items and business and properties marketing included elsewhere in this form k 
the company continues to monitor oil and gas prices and may enter into additional oil and gas hedges or swaps in the future 
relatively modest changes in either oil or gas prices significantly impact the company s results of operations and cash flow 
however  the impact of changes in the market prices for oil and gas on the company s average realized prices may be reduced from time to time based on the level of the company s hedging activities 
based on oil production  a change in the average oil price realized  before hedges  by the company of per bbl would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively 
a cent per mcf change in the average price realized  before hedges  by the company for gas would result in a change in net income and cash flow before income taxes on an annual basis of approximately million and million  respectively  based on gas production 
period to period comparison year ended december  compared to year ended december  during december and may  the company made two acquisitions which significantly impacted the period to period comparison for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  these acquisitions the canadian acquisitions include the purchase of percent of the outstanding common stock of cometra energy canada ltd 
the cometra acquisition in december and the purchase of percent of the outstanding common stock of genesis exploration ltd 
the genesis acquisition in may the company s consolidated revenues and expenses for the year ended december   include  under the purchase method of accounting  the consolidation of the revenues and expenses of genesis for the last eight months of the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the same period in an increase in the company s oil and gas production of percent on an equivalent barrel basis was substantially offset by a percent reduction in average oil prices and higher charges for depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties and goodwill 
net income for included a million after tax loss due to the impairment of oil and gas properties  a million after tax gain on sales of non strategic properties and a million after tax gain due to the devaluation of the argentine peso in december net income for included a million after tax non recurring charge due to an adverse judgment from litigation  a million after tax loss on sales of non strategic properties and a million after tax loss due to a change in accounting principle 
oil and gas sales increased million eight percent  to million for from million for a percent increase in gas production  partially offset by a two percent decrease in average gas prices  accounted for a million increase in gas sales for as compared to a percent decrease in average oil prices more than offset an percent increase in oil production and accounted for a million decrease in oil sales for as compared to the percent increase in oil production and the percent increase in gas production are primarily the result of the canadian acquisitions and the company s exploitation and exploration activities  partially offset by declines in us production 
a gain on disposition of assets of million million net of tax was reflected in as a result of million in proceeds from divestitures of non strategic oil and gas properties in the united states 
in  the company recorded a loss on disposition of assets of million million net of tax 
other than the gain recorded  the divestitures did not significantly affect the company s results of operations as the majority of the divestitures occurred in the fourth quarter of as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  the argentine government took actions which  in effect  caused the devaluation of the peso in early december the translation of peso denominated balances at december   and peso denominated transactions during december increased net income by approximately million  consisting of a foreign currency exchange gain of approximately million included in other income expense on the statement of operations and approximately million in reductions of certain operating expenses 
there was no such gain in as a result of an unfavorable decision by the supreme court of argentina  the company had recorded as other expense in a non recurring charge of million million net of tax 
no similar charge was incurred in lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million percent  to million for from million for primarily due to the percent increase in production  increased lease power and fuels costs  higher costs for oilfield services and certain one time repair costs in the us lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced increased percent to in from for as the result of a securities and exchange commission mandate  transportation and storage costs billed to the company have been reclassified to lease operating expenses for all periods shown 
these costs had been previously reported as a reduction of oil and gas revenues consistent with oil and gas industry practice 
this reclassification added cents and cents to the reported lease operating expense per boe in and  respectively 
exploration costs decreased million percent  to million for from million for during  the company s exploration costs included million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and lease impairments  primarily in north america  and million for seismic and other geological and geophysical costs 
exploration costs for included million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling  primarily in bolivia  million for leasehold impairments and million for other geological and geophysical costs 
impairments of oil and gas properties of million million net of tax were recognized in  compared to million of impairments in  due primarily to reserve revisions on certain canadian and us properties 
the company reviews its proved properties for impairment on a field basis and recognizes an impairment whenever events or circumstances such as declining oil and gas prices indicate that the properties carrying values may not be recoverable 
if an impairment is indicated based on the company s estimated future net revenues for total proved and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves on a field basis  then a provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the present value of the estimated future net revenues fair value 
in estimating the future net revenues  the company assumed that oil and gas prices and operating costs would escalate annually beginning at current levels 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is possible that the company s assumptions regarding oil and gas prices may change in the future 
if future price expectations are reduced  it is possible that additional significant impairment provisions for oil and gas properties would be required 
also  the economic instability in argentina could cause economic conditions that would result in future significant impairments for the company s oil and gas properties in that country 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for due primarily to costs associated with the canadian operations acquired through the canadian acquisitions and personnel additions and consulting costs in conjunction with the company s higher level of capital expenditures 
general and administrative expenses per equivalent barrel produced increased slightly to for from for depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to the percent increase in production on a boe basis and the percent increase in the average amortization rate per equivalent barrel produced from in to in primarily due to the genesis acquisition 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchase of genesis 
in  goodwill was amortized using the unit of production basis over the total proved reserves acquired and totaled approximately million 
there was no goodwill amortization recorded in the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
management has not determined at this time if the adoption of sfas no 
will have any other impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
management plans to engage an independent appraisal firm to perform an assessment of the fair value of its canadian segment  which will be compared to the carrying value of the segment to determine whether any impairment existed on the date of adoption 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company has six months from the time of adoption to have its appraisal completed 
interest expense increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent increase in the company s total average outstanding debt year over year  primarily due to the canadian acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset as the company s overall average interest rate decreased to percent in as compared to percent in this reduction resulted from lower rates on its floating rate debt due to overall market reductions and a significant increase in its level of lower cost floating rate borrowings versus fixed rate debt 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the same period in a percent increase in average oil prices  a percent increase in average gas prices received by the company and a percent increase in production on a boe basis were primarily responsible for the significant increase in its net income 
oil and gas sales increased million percent  to million for from million for a percent increase in average oil prices combined with an percent increase in oil production accounted for an increase of million 
a percent increase in average gas prices  coupled with an percent increase in gas production  accounted for an additional increase of million 
the company had an percent increase in oil production primarily as a result of argentina production added through the acquisitions of the el huemul concession the el huemul acquisition and additional working interests in its two producing concessions in ecuador collectively  the acquisitions and the exploitation activities in argentina 
the company s gas production rose by percent due primarily to the gas production from the el huemul concession acquired in july and increased production in bolivia as a result of increased takes into the bolivia to brazil pipeline 
this increase more than offset the decline in us gas production as a result of the december sale of certain oil and gas properties located in northern california s sacramento basin area 
gains on disposition of assets of million million net of income taxes were reflected in as a result of million in proceeds from various oil and gas property divestitures in the us other than the million in gains reported  the divestitures did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as the majority of the divestitures occurred during december in  the company recorded a loss on the disposition of assets  primarily as a result of post closing adjustments on dispositions  of million 
as a result of an unfavorable decision by the supreme court of argentina  the company recorded as other expense in a non recurring charge of million million net of tax 
no similar charge existed in for further information regarding this litigation see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
lease operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million percent  to million for from million for the increase in lease operating expenses is primarily due to the acquisitions and an increase in production taxes due to higher product prices 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel produced increased to in from for the same period in as the result of a securities and exchange commission mandate  transportation and storage costs billed to the company have been reclassified to lease operating expenses for all periods shown 
these costs had been previously reported as a reduction of oil and gas revenues consistent with oil and gas industry practice 
this reclassification added cents and cents to the reported lease operating expense per boe for the years and  respectively 
exploration costs increased million percent  to million for from million for during  the company s exploration costs included million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and leasehold impairments associated with a much higher exploration capital budget and the drilling of an increased number of higher risk exploratory wells during the year  and million for seismic and other geological and geophysical costs 
due to reduced cash flow levels  the company significantly reduced its capital budget for exploration expenses for consisted of million for seismic data acquisition  million for unsuccessful exploratory drilling and million for lease impairments and other geological and geophysical costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to personnel additions in conjunction with increased capital expenditures  the acquisitions and the delay of annual compensation adjustments from january until august 
the company s g a per boe for was compared to for depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million seven percent  to million for from million for  despite a percent increase in total production due primarily to higher reserves resulting from higher product prices used throughout the year in the dd a calculation 
the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel produced decreased from in to in interest expense decreased million percent  to million for from million for  due primarily to a percent decrease in the company s total average outstanding debt due to the company s significant repayment of outstanding debt as a result of significantly increased cash flow and the million of cash proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in late the company s average interest rate for its outstanding debt for was percent compared to percent in capital expenditures during  the company s total oil and gas capital expenditures were million  including million allocated to producing oil and gas properties as part of the genesis acquisition and million for the acquisition of the la ventana and rio tunuyan concessions in argentina 
in north america  the company s non acquisition oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million  including million for undeveloped leasehold as part of the acquisition of genesis 
exploration activities accounted for million of the north america capital expenditures with exploitation activities contributing million 
during  the company s international non acquisition oil and gas capital expenditures totaled million  consisting of million in argentina on exploitation activities  million in ecuador  principally on exploitation  and million and million on exploration projects in trinidad and yemen  respectively 
the company also spent another million in other international areas 
as of december   the company had total unproved oil and gas property costs of approximately million consisting of undeveloped leasehold costs of million  including million in canada  and exploratory drilling in progress of million 
approximately million of the unproved costs are associated with the company s yemen drilling program 
future exploration expense and earnings may be impacted to the extent any of the exploratory drilling is determined to be unsuccessful 
on may   the company completed the genesis acquisition for total consideration of million  including transaction costs and the assumption of the estimated net indebtedness of genesis at closing see note significant acquisition to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the cash portion of the acquisition price was paid through advances under the company s revolving credit facility and cash on hand 
the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company uses internally generated cash flow to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions 
the company s preliminary capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  exclusive of acquisitions 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast 
the company is actively pursuing additional acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
in addition to internally generated cash flow and advances under its revolving credit facility  the company may seek additional sources of capital to fund any future significant acquisitions see liquidity  however  no assurance can be given that sufficient funds will be available to fund the company s desired acquisitions 
the company s recent capital expenditure history is as follows years ended december  in thousands acquisition of oil and gas reserves    drilling    acquisition of undeveloped acreage and seismic    workovers and recompletions    other  oil and gas capital expenditures    acquisition and construction of gathering systems  total    liquidity internally generated cash flow  the borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and its ability to adjust its level of capital expenditures are the company s major sources of liquidity 
in addition  the company may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  to fund any major acquisitions it might secure in the future and to maintain its financial flexibility 
in the past  the company has accessed the public markets to finance significant acquisitions and provide liquidity for its future activities 
since  in conjunction with the purchase of substantial oil and gas assets  the company has completed five public equity offerings as well as two public debt offerings and two rule a debt offerings  which provided the company with aggregate net proceeds of million 
on january   the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after february  the notes mature on june   with interest payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes approximately million were used to repay a portion of the existing indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
on june   the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  all of which were sold by the company 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to partially fund the purchase of the el huemul concession from total and repsol in early july also in july  in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of a portion of the over allotment option  the company sold an additional  shares of common stock using the additional million of net proceeds to reduce a portion of the company s existing indebtedness under its revolving credit facility 
on may   the company issued million of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may  in addition  prior to may   the company may redeem up to percent of the notes with the proceeds of certain underwritten public offerings of the company s common stock 
the notes mature on may   with interest payable semiannually on may and november of each year 
all of the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes were used to repay a portion of the existing indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
under the second amended and restated credit agreement dated november   as amended  the bank facility  certain banks have provided to the company a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the bank facility establishes a borrowing base determined by the banks evaluation of the company s oil and gas reserves 
the amount available to be borrowed under the bank facility is limited to the lesser of the facility size or the borrowing base 
outstanding advances under the bank facility bear interest payable quarterly at a floating rate based on bank of montreal s alternate base rate as defined or  at the company s option  at a fixed rate for up to six months based on the eurodollar market rate libor 
the company s interest rate increments above the alternate base rate and libor vary based on the level of outstanding senior debt to the borrowing base 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under its bank facility  excluding outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
as of february   the company had elected a fixed rate based on libor for a substantial portion of its outstanding advances  which resulted in an average interest rate of approximately percent per annum 
in addition  the company must pay a commitment fee ranging from to percent per annum on the unused portion of the banks commitment 
on a semiannual basis  the company s borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based upon their review of the company s oil and gas reserves 
if the sum of outstanding senior debt exceeds the borrowing base  as redetermined  the company must repay such excess 
final maturity of the bank facility is november the company s unused availability under the bank facility at february   was approximately million  however  the borrowing base is currently under review by the banks 
due to lower oil and gas price expectations by the banks and the economic instability in argentina  the agent and syndication agent banks have recommended a new borrowing base of million  with security provided by the company on certain assets 
this recommendation is pending approval of percent of the banks in the syndicate 
if approved  the company will have approximately million available under the bank facility 
the unused portion of the bank facility and the company s internally generated cash flow provide liquidity which may be used to finance future capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
as additional acquisitions are made and such properties are added to the borrowing base  the banks determination of the borrowing base and their commitments may be increased 
the next borrowing base redetermination will be in may the company s internally generated cash flow  results of operations and financing for its operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
for  approximately percent of the company s production was oil 
realized oil prices for the year decreased by percent as compared to this decline in prices substantially offset an increase in total production on a boe basis of percent 
the company believes that its cash flows and unused availability under the bank facility are sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
to the extent oil prices continue to decline  the company s earnings and cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted 
continued low oil and gas prices could cause the company to not be in compliance with maintenance covenants under its bank facility and could negatively affect its credit statistics and coverage ratios and thereby affect its liquidity 
inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
however  industry specific inflationary pressures built up in late and in due to favorable conditions in the industry 
while oil and gas prices have recently declined  the cost of services in the oil and gas industry have not declined by a similar percentage 
any increases in product prices could cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase 
as a result of the recent devaluation of the peso  the company expects inflationary pressures to build in argentina 
the company anticipates that peso denominated costs will gradually increase  but the ultimate impact of such increases when converted to us dollars cannot be determined due to the uncertainty of future currency exchange rates 
income taxes the company incurred a current provision for income taxes of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the total provision for us income taxes is based on the federal corporate statutory income tax rate plus an estimated average rate for state income taxes 
earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income taxes 
no us deferred tax liability has been recognized related to the unremitted earnings of these foreign subsidiaries as it is the company s intention  generally  to reinvest such earnings permanently 
the company fully utilized its us federal regular tax net operating loss nol carryforward in and its us federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward in the company has a bolivian income tax nol carryforward of approximately million that does not expire and an ecuadorian income tax nol of approximately million that expires in varying annual amounts over a five year period beginning in  both of which can be used to offset its future income tax liabilities 
in addition to its nol carryforward in ecuador  the company also has a million deferred devaluation loss carryforward that is available to offset future taxable income 
no asset has been recorded for this loss carryforward  which expires in the income tax benefit will be recorded in the period in which the loss carryforward is utilized 
at december   the company also had an argentine income tax nol of approximately million pesos million from its recently acquired subsidiary  vintage petroleum argentina sa  that expires in varying annual amounts over a five year period beginning in and can be used to offset future income tax liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  contains a comprehensive summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in its consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this form k are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by gaap and by the sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by its independent petroleum consultants 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows should not be assumed to be the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves were based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion  depreciation and amortization expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field basis 
for each field  an impairment provision is recorded whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those properties may not be recoverable 
the impairment provision is based on the excess of carrying value over fair value 
fair value is defined as the present value of the estimated future net revenues from production of total proved and risk adjusted probable and possible oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the reserves  based on the company s expectations of future oil and gas prices and costs  consistent with methods used for acquisition evaluations 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  in february  the argentina government also imposed a percent excise tax on oil exports  effective march  this tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years 
had this export tax been in effect at december   it would not have had a material impact on the company s assessment of impairment of its oil and gas properties in argentina 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
unproved leasehold costs are capitalized and are reviewed periodically for impairment 
costs related to impaired prospects are charged to expense 
an impairment expense could result if oil and gas prices decline in the future as it may not be economic to develop some of these unproved properties 
impairment of goodwill 
the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by determining whether the net book value of the goodwill can be recovered through the aggregate of the excess of undiscounted future net revenues of the acquired properties over the net book value of those properties 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is defined as projected discounted future net revenues 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future net revenues are not achieved 
see new accounting pronouncements for discussion of the policy change that the company adopted in revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of the company s results of operations and also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as severance taxes and royalties 
the company follows a very specific and detailed guideline of recognizing revenues when oil and gas are delivered to the purchaser 
however  certain judgments affect the application of the company s revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
income taxes 
the company provides deferred income taxes on transactions which are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes 
the company has not recognized a us deferred tax liability related to the unremitted earnings of any of its foreign subsidiaries as it is the company s intention  generally  to reinvest such earnings permanently 
the company has also recorded deferred tax assets related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
management periodically assesses the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks by tax jurisdiction 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove to be incorrect in the future 
assessments of functional currencies 
all of the company s subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency  except for the company s canadian subsidiaries  which use the canadian dollar 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
argentina economic and currency measures 
the accounting for and translation of the company s argentina balance sheet as of december   reflects management s assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to argentina s current economic situation 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
the argentina economic and political situation continues to evolve and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that  when finalized and adopted  may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices the company receives for oil and gas it produces and sells as a result of export taxes  ii the timing of repatriations of cash to the us  iii the company s asset valuations  and iv peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities

the company continues to monitor oil and gas prices and may enter into additional oil and gas hedges or swaps in the future 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk exposure results primarily from short term rates  mainly libor based borrowings from its commercial banks

at december   the amount of the company s fixed rate debt was approximately percent of total debt 
in the past  the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner

the company s operations in canada accounted for approximately percent of its total assets  including goodwill  at december  the majority of these canadian assets were purchased on may   as part of the acquisition of genesis and the company s exploration and production operations include only eight months of the operations of genesis in at december   none of the company s other international operations accounted for more than percent of its total assets 
the company continues to identify and evaluate international opportunities  but currently has no binding agreements or commitments to make any material international investment 
as a result of such significant foreign operations  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate in these foreign countries 
historically  the company has not used derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
however  the company evaluates currency fluctuations and will consider the use of derivative financial instruments or employment of other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant 
the company s international operations may be adversely affected by political and economic instability  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and other factors 
the company s foreign properties  operations or investments in canada  argentina  bolivia  ecuador  yemen and trinidad may be adversely affected by a number of factors 
for example o local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of the company s foreign operations  o exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses  o royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of the company s foreign operations  o expropriation of the company s property could result in loss of revenue  property and equipment  o import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues  and o laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment could restrict the company s ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly 
the company does not currently maintain political risk insurance 
however  the company will consider obtaining such coverage in the future if conditions so warrant 
canada 
with the acquisition of cometra in december and the acquisition of genesis in may  the company now has significant producing operations in canada 
the company views the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good 
all of the company s canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with its canadian operations would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the us c exchange rate at december   was us c as compared to us c at december  argentina 
beginning in  peronist carlos menem  as newly elected president of argentina  and domingo cavallo  as his economy minister  set out to reverse economic decline through free market reforms such as open trade 
the key to their plan was the law of convertibility under which the peso was tied to the us dollar at a rate of one peso to one us dollar 
between and the plan succeeded 
with the risk of devaluation apparently removed  capital came in from abroad and much of argentina s state owned assets were privatized 
during this period  the economy grew at an annual average rate of percent  the highest in the region 
however  the convertibility plan left argentina with few monetary policy tools to respond to outside events 
a series of external shocks began in prices for argentina s commodities stopped rising  the dollar appreciated against other currencies  and brazil  argentina s main trading partner  devalued its currency 
argentina began a period of economic deflation  but failed to respond by reforming government spending 
during  argentina s budget deficit exceeded billion and its sovereign debt reached billion 
as a result of economic instability and substantial withdrawals from the banking system  in early december  the argentine government instituted restrictions that prohibited foreign money transfers without central bank approval and prohibited cash withdrawals from bank accounts above a certain amount with certain limited exceptions 
while the legal exchange rate remained at one peso to one us dollar  financial institutions were allowed to conduct only limited activity due to these controls  and currency exchange activity was effectively halted except for personal transactions in small amounts 
these actions by the government  in effect  caused a devaluation of the peso in december on january   the argentine government enacted an emergency law that required certain contracts that were previously payable in us dollars to be payable in pesos 
us dollars in argentine banks on this date were converted to pesos at the government imposed rate of pesos to one us dollar 
pursuant to the emergency law  us dollar obligations between private parties due after january   are to be liquidated in pesos at a negotiated rate of exchange which reflects a sharing of the impact of the devaluation 
the emergency law requires the obligor to make an interim payment of one peso per us dollar of the claim and provides a period of days for the parties to negotiate the final amount to settle the us dollar obligation 
on february   the argentine government announced a percent tax on oil exports  effective march  the tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years 
the company currently exports approximately percent of its argentina oil production 
however  management believes that this export tax will have the effect of decreasing all future argentina oil revenues not only export revenues by the tax rate for the duration of the tax 
management believes that the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentina oil sales now paid in pesos will move over time to parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax  thus impacting domestic argentina values by a like percentage to the tax 
the adverse impact of this tax will be partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs and may be further reduced by the argentina income tax savings related to deducting such impact 
at december   the imposition of the export tax would not have had a material impact on the company s assessment of impairment of its oil and gas properties in argentina 
the company continues to monitor the political and economic environment in argentina 
the company s capital budgets have been adjusted to reflect a reduced level of drilling in the country 
in addition  the devaluation of the peso is expected to result in a near term reduction in revenues  substantially offset by a reduction in peso denominated operating  administrative and capital costs  and the recognition of translation gains and losses  the impact of which cannot currently be accurately estimated 
bolivia 
since the mid s  bolivia has been undergoing major economic reform  including the establishment of a free market economy and the encouragement of foreign private investment 
economic activities that had been reserved for government corporations were opened to foreign and domestic bolivian private investments 
barriers to international trade have been reduced and tariffs lowered 
a new investment law and revised codes for mining and the petroleum industry  intended to attract foreign investment  have been introduced

mr 
quiroga  who is a us educated industrial engineer  will run the country until new elections are held  which are currently scheduled for june  he will be barred from running in those elections due to term limits 
in  the boliviano bs replaced the peso at the rate of one million pesos to one boliviano 
the exchange rate is set daily by the government s exchange house  the bolsin  which is under the supervision of the bolivian central bank 
foreign exchange transactions are not subject to any controls 
the us bs exchange rate at december   was us bs 
the company believes that any currency risk associated with its bolivian operations would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
ecuador 
in ecuador  president gustavo noboa and congress continue to debate further tax  social  and customs reforms to strengthen economic growth 
the legal basis for many of the recent reforms is the ley fundamental para la transformacion economica del ecuador the economic transformation law enacted in march  which mandated dollarization of the economy 
as a result of this reform  all of the company s ecuadorian revenues and costs are us dollar based 
even though the second phase of the economic transformation law known as trole ii  which was intended to bring significant tax and labor reform and a defined privatization program to increase inflows of foreign direct investment  was rejected by congress  president noboa used his veto powers to pass a tax reform package which allowed the international monetary fund imf to make a disbursement of its stand by loan in the second quarter of having met the fiscal targets in agreed to by the imf  the government will be seeking further stand by financing for fixed investments significantly increased in as construction of the new heavy oil pipeline the ocp continues to progress on schedule
