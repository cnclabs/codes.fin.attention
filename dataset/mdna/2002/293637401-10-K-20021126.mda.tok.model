item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the section below titled cautionary statements  our consolidated financial statements and related notes  and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this transition report on form k 
our current fiscal period consists of the ten month transition period from march  through december  which we refer to as transition throughout this item for fiscal years prior to this period  our fiscal year ended on the saturday closest to last calendar day of february in each year 
we refer to the twelve month periods ended march  and february  as fiscal and fiscal  respectively throughout this item overview we design  develop  market and support comprehensive networking solutions focusing on the network security  availability and mobility needs of enterprises 
our solutions empower customers to use their internal networks and the internet to facilitate the exchange of information  increase productivity and reduce operating costs 
using our products  customers make information  applications and services readily available and customized to the needs of their employees  customers  suppliers  business partners and other network users 
our significant installed base of customers consists of commercial enterprises  governmental entities  healthcare  educational  financial and non profit institutions  and other organizations 
in february  cabletron systems  inc cabletron  as part of an effort to improve strategic focus and better capitalize on market opportunities  transferred substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities to four operating subsidiaries as part of a plan to make each of the subsidiaries independent 
these subsidiaries were enterasys networks  inc enterasys subsidiary  riverstone networks  inc 
riverstone  aprisma management technologies  inc aprisma  and globalnetwork technology services  inc gnts 
each of these subsidiaries had its own management team and board of directors 
in july  the operations of gnts were discontinued through the acquisition of a portion of gnts by a third party  the assumption of certain contracts and employees of gnts by enterasys subsidiary and aprisma  and the discontinuance of the remaining business operations of gnts 
following the initial public offering of a portion of riverstone s common stock in february  cabletron distributed its holdings of riverstone s common stock to cabletron s stockholders in a spin off transaction on august  also on august   enterasys subsidiary was merged with and into cabletron and the name of the surviving corporation was changed to enterasys networks  inc on august   we completed the sale of aprisma to a third party 
sec investigation and internal review of accounting practices on january   we discovered that a previously recognized million sale in our asia pacific region did not qualify for revenue recognition during the period in which we had originally reported the revenue 
also on january   we learned that the sec had opened a formal order of investigation into our and our affiliate s financial accounting and reporting practices 
in response to these developments  our board of directors formed a special committee to conduct an internal review into our financial accounting and reporting practices for the fiscal year ended march  and the ten month transition period ended december  the special committee appointed the law firm of ropes gray to conduct the internal review  and ropes gray hired the forensic accounting group of deloitte touche llp to assist with the internal review 
we have incurred costs of approximately million related to the internal review through october the special committee has completed the internal review and we have restated our financial statements for the fiscal year ended march   the fiscal quarters within that fiscal year  and the first three fiscal quarters within the ten month transition period ended december  to reflect the results of the internal review 
since the identification of the matters leading to the internal review  and in some cases in response to issues identified in the course of the internal review  we have taken a variety of remedial and other actions intended to improve our policies  procedures and controls as discussed below  and as discussed in more detail in item controls and procedures 

table of contents we hired new management in most senior finance and operations capacities and bolstered our finance staff in several key areas 
we have also added an internal audit director who reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors as well as to our chief financial officer 
we are in the process of training our employees on improved financial and accounting policies  procedures and controls 
for example  we have revised our revenue recognition policy  and have distributed it to and discussed it with our sales and finance personnel 
we are also in the process of updating our code of conduct  which we will distribute and emphasize to all employees 
we are also developing a formal acknowledgement procedure whereby employees will be periodically asked to certify their familiarity and compliance with our code of conduct and various other policies and procedures relevant to them 
the individuals identified as having participated in  or who reasonably should have known about conduct contrary to our internal policies  have left our organization  have been terminated or have otherwise been disciplined 
we have established and publicized among our employees a zero tolerance policy for employees who engage in unethical or inappropriate business conduct 
we have met with managers throughout our organization to emphasize this zero tolerance policy 
to assist us in identifying any violations in the future  we have established and publicized to all personnel an employee help line  which employees are able to use for the confidential  anonymous submission of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters 
the principal adjustments to restate the financial statements for the fiscal year ended march   the fiscal quarters within that fiscal year  and the first three quarters within the ten month transition period ended december  are discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item to this transition report on form k 
fiscal year changes 
in september  we amended our by laws to change our fiscal year end from the saturday closest to the last day in february of each year to the saturday closest to the last day in december of each year 
this transition report on form k relates to the ten month transition period ended december  and our results of operations for this period only include the ten month period from march  to december  fiscal and each include twelve months of operations 
we have not included a comparable ten month period for the period march  to december  because it was impracticable to do so given certain inherent limitations in our interim monthly closing process and the complexity of the restatement of our fiscal financial statements 
segment reporting 
as a result of our decision to discontinue or dispose of the operations of riverstone  gnts and aprisma  during transition we operated our business as two segments 
our enterasys segment is in the business of developing  selling and servicing standards based networking solutions using a switched ethernet platform 
we also include maintenance services relating both to our standards based and to our non standards based products in our enterasys segment 
we currently derive all of our revenue from these products and related services 
in prior years  we also developed and sold non standards based solutions 
over time  these solutions proved unsuitable for the evolving networking requirements of enterprise customers 
as a result  the focus of our business shifted to our switched ethernet platform products 
beginning in fiscal  we started reducing our marketing and research and development efforts relating to our non standards based products and sold the remaining assets related to these products in september our other segment includes the revenue and cost of revenue relating to non standards based products 
we do not anticipate that our other segment will generate any future revenue or expense 
application of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this transition report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and 
table of contents expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base estimates and judgments on historical experience  market and industry trends  and other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is comprised of product revenue  which includes revenue from sales of our switches and routers  other network equipment and software  and services revenue  which includes revenue from maintenance  installation and system integration services 
revenue from service obligations under maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically months 
we generally recognize product revenue from our end user and reseller customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain after products are delivered  such as integration or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical returns  return policies and contractual product return rights granted to our customers 
the allowance has been reflected as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
if the data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future returns  these estimates would have to be modified  thus impacting revenue recognized in future periods 
beginning in september  we determined that we could no longer estimate the amount of future product returns from certain stocking distributors located in the united states and europe 
we now recognize revenue from these distributors when they ship our product to their customers 
beginning in fiscal  we began recording revenue from certain distributors and resellers located in asia pacific and latin america on a cash basis due to existing practices related to distribution reseller arrangements 
in the past we sold products and services to customers in exchange for minority investments  consisting of debt or equity securities  accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
in some instances  we issued product credits  or the right to purchase products which  when used  were exchanged for debt or equity securities by the investee company  and in other cases  we invested cash that was then used by the investee company to purchase products from us 
the amount of revenue that we recognized in connection with minority investments was based upon the nature of the transaction and fair value of the debt or equity instrument received 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the amount of bad debts that may be incurred in the future 
we analyze specific customer accounts  historical experience  customer concentrations  credit ratings and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established to account for the differences between our forecasted demand and the amount of purchased and committed inventory 
we have experienced significant variances between the amount of inventory purchased and contractually committed to and our demand forecasts  resulting in material excess and obsolete inventory charges 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets are comprised of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  fixed assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  fixed assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset or goodwill exceeds the related fair value 
estimated fair value is generally based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the underlying asset in question 
in certain cases  we obtain an independent valuation of intangible assets to support the amount of our proposed impairment charge 

table of contents valuation of investments 
investments are comprised of privately held corporate debt and equity securities and in limited cases  common stock in thinly traded publicly held companies 
we review these investments for potential impairments by monitoring significant declines in the investee s stock price in new rounds of financing  market capitalization relative to book value  bankruptcy or insolvency and deterioration in the financial condition or results of operations 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded restructuring charges in connection with our plans to reduce the cost structure of our business 
these restructuring charges  which reflect management s commitment to a termination or exit plan that will be completed within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with fixed asset valuation allowances  severance benefits and facility exit costs 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a reduction to special charges will be recognized 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we increase or decrease our income tax provision in our statement of operations 
if any of our estimates of our prior period taxable income or loss prove to be incorrect  material differences could impact the amount and timing of income tax benefits or payments for any period

table of contents transition overview we incurred a significant net loss in transition due primarily to the following factors significantly lower sales volume  reduced gross margins due to discounting and other incentive programs associated with our increased use of distributors and channel partners  our cost structure  which was not aligned with our revenue base  costs associated with our separation from our former operating subsidiaries  significant charges for asset impairments  excess and obsolete inventory  doubtful accounts and deferred taxes  costs related to our investment activities  and losses associated with discontinued operations 
a more detailed discussion of the individual components of our consolidated results of operations follows 
net revenue we manage our sales and marketing based on four geographic regions the united states and canada north america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  asia and australia asia pacific  and south america  mexico and the caribbean latin america 
net revenue includes product and services revenue for each region and is summarized in the following table transition fiscal revenue percent revenue percent amounts in millions restated north america emea asia pacific latin america total net revenue our segment revenue is summarized in the following table transition fiscal in millions restated enterasys segment other segment total net revenue net revenue declined by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in transition services revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in transition transition included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal  which accounted for approximately million of the decline based on average monthly services revenue for transition lower product sales  which typically include associated maintenance  is the principal reason for the remaining decrease 

table of contents product revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in transition due primarily to the following factors transition included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal  due to the change in our fiscal year 
based on average monthly product revenue for transition  approximately million of the decrease may be attributable to the shorter fiscal period 
we eliminated non standards based products from our product portfolio  resulting in a decline of approximately million 
as a result of a change in accounting made in the third quarter of transition  we began recognizing revenue when product was shipped by north american and emea distributors to their customers 
approximately million of inventory held by these distributors at december  was not recorded as revenue in transition as the products had not yet been shipped to their customers 
in contrast  in fiscal we recognized revenue from these distributors when we shipped product to them  subject to provisions for returns 
increased use of and higher levels of pricing incentives associated with distributors and other channel partners 
the remaining decline in revenue was attributable to a variety of factors  including an industry wide slowdown  and lengthening sales cycles  particularly in the fourth quarter of transition during the first nine months of fiscal  the market for telecommunications and networking equipment and solutions was challenging 
in addition  we faced some unique challenges given the lack of availability of our detailed current financial information 
our revenue declined from million in the fourth quarter of transition to an estimated million in the first quarter of fiscal we estimate that revenue in each of the second and third quarters of fiscal was stable compared with the first quarter of fiscal we were favorably impacted by the stability of our services revenue during these periods 
we believe that our future revenue will generally fluctuate with overall changes in the markets that we currently serve 
our future revenue will be affected by the nature and timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us  as well as other competitive factors 
gross margin total gross margin declined from million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in transition service gross margin declined by million from million in fiscal to million in transition year  due primarily to the shorter transition year 
service gross margin as a percent of service revenue remained relatively constant 
product gross margins declined from million  or of product revenue  in fiscal  to a negative million  or negative of product revenue  in transition  due primarily to the following factors a million decline in product revenue  which accounts for approximately million of the margin decrease  assuming constant fiscal margin 
an increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges of million  due primarily to lower than forecasted sales volume 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in penalties to our contract manufacturers related to reducing production levels below minimum contractual requirements 
an increase in business development funding to distributors and channel partners  including funding for training  cooperative advertising and other special programs  of approximately million 
an increase in the use of stocking distributors and other indirect channel partners  the sales to which inherently carry lower margins than direct sales 
in addition  we granted significant pricing concessions to these partners during the transition year 

table of contents an increase in the levels of product rotations and returns  including associated handling and evaluation costs 
our cost structure  which was designed to support a higher revenue base than we achieved 
during the first nine months of fiscal we have sought to mitigate the factors contributing to depressed product gross margins in transition specifically  we have reduced the level of business development funding and pricing concessions granted to distributors and channel partners  taken actions to better align our cost structure with our present sales volume  and focused on lowering standard product costs 
we are restructuring our supply chain management organization  with the goal of reducing excess and obsolete inventory costs and improving the efficiency of sourcing and delivery of product to our customers 
we anticipate these initiatives will improve gross margin to historical ranges in the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal operating expenses research and development expenses declined by million from million in fiscal to million in transition due primarily to the fact that transition included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal  offset by increased spending in transition based on average monthly spending during transition  research and development spending for the full year would have exceeded fiscal by approximately million  or an increase of  due primarily to sustained investments in new product development initiatives 
research and development spending in fiscal is expected to remain consistent with spending levels during transition selling  general and administrative expenses sg a declined by million from million in fiscal to million in transition  due primarily to the fact that transition included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal and headcount reductions implemented in connection with the cabletron transformation  offset by million of net expense associated with lease guarantee payments 
in  we implemented and expect to continue to implement cost improvement initiatives to better align our cost structure with our revenue base 
however  we expect sg a expenses will be adversely impacted by the increase in professional services fees incurred in connection with the sec investigation  our internal review and associated stockholder litigation 
amortization of intangibles increased by million from million in fiscal to million in transition  due primarily to the fact that transition included ten months of indus river networks intangible assets amortization as compared with one month of such amortization in fiscal as a result of the impairment charge relating to the acquired goodwill of indus river networks recorded in the fourth quarter of transition and implementation of new accounting rules concerning acquired goodwill in  amortization of intangibles is expected to decline significantly in stock based compensation in transition was million and related to the granting of options to purchase shares of the enterasys subsidiary primarily to employees of cabletron of million and the acceleration of vesting of previously granted options to purchase our common stock to our employees of million 
we recorded stock based compensation in transition and fiscal of million and million  respectively  related to stock and stock options issued in connection with the acquisition of network security wizards and indus river networks that were contingent upon continued employment of key employees 

table of contents special charges consisted of the following transition fiscal in millions restated in process research and development related to acquisition transformation charges restructuring charges total special charges in the second quarter of transition  we recorded special charges of million related to the transformation of cabletron s business 
we incurred million of similar expense in fiscal the transformation related charges include investment banking  legal and accounting fees related to the establishment of the enterasys subsidiary  riverstone  aprisma and gnts as independent  stand alone entities 
also during the second quarter of transition  we recorded restructuring charges of million to reduce our expense structure 
these charges reflected the write down of a vacant office building in rochester  nh to its estimated fair value of million  exit costs associated with the planned closure of eight sales offices worldwide and executive severance costs 
the exit costs that we incurred related primarily to long term lease commitments which will be paid out over several years 
in the fourth quarter of transition  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for employee severance costs associated with the reduction of approximately individuals from our global workforce 
the reduction in the global workforce involved principally sales  engineering and administrative personnel and has also included targeted reductions impacting most functions within the organization 
in fiscal  we recorded net restructuring charges of million 
these charges reflected the expected sale of an office building in rochester  nh  exit costs associated with the planned closure of sales offices worldwide  the write off of certain assets that were not required subsequent to the cabletron transformation and the planned reduction of approximately individuals from our global workforce 
the reduction in the global workforce involved principally sales  engineering and administrative personnel and has also included targeted reductions impacting most functions within the organization 
the exit costs that we incurred related primarily to long term lease commitments 
on january   we acquired indus river networks  a designer and marketer of virtual private networks for enterprise class customers 
in connection with the acquisition  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research development and recorded in special charges for fiscal impairment of intangible assets reflects a charge of million in the fourth quarter of transition relating to goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of indus river networks 
this impairment was primarily due to the complex  proprietary nature of the indus river vpn architecture  which had to be substantially redesigned in order to conform with emerging industry standards and market expectations  the introduction of new  low cost vpn products and technologies by a leading provider of network security products who captured a market leadership position in  and abandonment of our development efforts in conjunction with a significant reduction in the acquired workforce in the fourth quarter of transition these factors led to significantly lower projections for future sales of products using the indus river vpn architecture 
loss from operations loss from operations increased from million in fiscal to million in transition due to the factors discussed above 
loss from operations in transition included several significant costs  including the indus river impairment  excess and obsolete inventory charges  stock based compensation expense  cabletron transformation costs  and restructuring charges 
while we may incur some of these costs in fiscal  we expect that they will be significantly lower than in transition 
table of contents in addition  in fiscal we implemented cost reduction programs  reduced the level of pricing incentives and market development funding granted to our distributors and channel partners  revised sales force compensation programs  improved inventory management procedures and controls  developed additional relationships with value added resellers and systems integrators to increase sales and market coverage  and adopted other initiatives designed to reduce our loss from operations 
however  we expect to incur significant operating losses in due to continued weakness in the markets that we serve  expenses associated with initiatives to align our cost structure with our revenue base  and costs associated with the sec investigation and internal review 
we expect our fiscal operating losses will be substantially lower than our transition operating losses 
interest income interest income declined from million in fiscal to million in transition due to lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates 
interest income is expected to further decline in fiscal due primarily to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
other income expense  net the following schedule reflects the components of other income expense  net

we entered into a number of transactions in which we made an investment in a customer in exchange for cash and or our products and services 
in certain of these transactions we recorded the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of the investment received as other expense 
these transactions resulted in other expense of for transition and million for fiscal during fiscal  we sold million shares of efficient common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and recognized approximately million of deferred gain to other income 
also during fiscal  we wrote call options to sell million shares of efficient at a weighted average price of and received premiums of approximately million which were recorded as a deferred gain 
at march   we determined that in accordance with sfas no 
 the efficient shares  
table of contents classified as available for sale securities  had experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we recognized a reduction in value of the efficient investment of million based on the expected realizable value of approximately per share 
there was an associated reduction in the deferred gain of million  which resulted in other expense of million during fiscal during transition  we sold million shares of efficient common stock and tendered our remaining million shares for proceeds of million in connection with a tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of efficient common stock made by siemens ag in connection with these transactions  we recognized the remaining deferred gain of million to other income 
additionally  the outstanding call options discussed above expired between march  and december  and we recognized the previously recorded deferred gain of million  net of the related transaction costs of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during transition during fiscal  we completed the sale of our dnpg division and certain legacy product lines 
the sale included certain inventory  accounts receivable  net fixed assets and related intangible assets  resulting in a loss on sale included in other expense of million 
income tax expense benefit we incurred income tax expense of million in transition due primarily to the increase in the deferred tax asset valuation reserve of million  partially offset by a reduction in current tax liabilities of million 
in addition  we did not record any income tax benefit relating to losses incurred in the period because expected income from operations and gains did not materialize in transition in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million which was a result of the losses incurred in that period  partially offset by a non deductible in process research and development charge of million and an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
in january  a tax law change was enacted whereby the allowable period to carry back net operating losses was increased from three to five years 
as a result  we received approximately million of federal income tax refunds relating to tax losses incurred in fiscal and transition in addition  we have approximately million of prior period taxable income available to offset potential losses in fiscal  the use of which is expected to generate up to approximately million of federal income tax refunds in loss from discontinued operations in transition we incurred million of operating losses from discontinued operations compared with million in fiscal  principally as a result of transition being two months shorter than fiscal  and the fact that riverstone and gnts were only a part of us for a portion of transition in addition  we incurred a loss on disposition in transition of million relating to the shutdown and sale of gnts and the sale of aprisma 
comparison of fiscal year with fiscal year net revenue net revenue declined from  million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in sales of non standards based products

the sale included certain inventory  accounts receivable  net fixed assets and related intangible assets  resulting in a loss on sale included in other expense of approximately million 
in december  we sold our flowpoint  inc subsidiary to efficient 
from march  through the date of the sale  flowpoint s net sales were approximately million 
under the terms of the sale  we received million shares of efficient common stock  including  shares of efficient convertible preferred stock that subsequently converted into million shares of efficient common stock  in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of flowpoint 
the common stock was subject to various restrictions on resale 
the flowpoint transaction was valued at approximately million based upon an independent valuation of the efficient stock  reflecting a discount from the closing price of the efficient stock on the nasdaq as of the sale date 
this resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
on the transaction date  we held of the outstanding common stock of efficient on an as converted basis 
accordingly  we deferred of the pre tax gain  or million  since through our ownership percentage of efficient  we effectively still had a interest in flowpoint 
because we had irrevocably relinquished our voting rights on all but of efficient s common stock  the efficient stock has been classified as an available for sale security 
as we sold the efficient shares  this deferred gain was recognized into income in proportion to our reduction in its percentage ownership of efficient 
our effective interest in flowpoint at the end of transition and the and fiscal years was  and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we sold million and million shares of efficient common stock  respectively  for net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively  and recognized approximately and million  respectively  of deferred gain to other income 
also during the fiscal year ended march   we wrote call options to sell million shares of efficient at a weighted average price of and received premiums of approximately million which were recorded as a deferred gain 
at march   we determined that in accordance with sfas no 
 the efficient shares  classified as available for sale securities  had experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we recognized a reduction in value of the efficient investment of million based on the expected realizable value of approximately per share 
there was an associated reduction in the deferred gain of million  which resulted in other expense of million during fiscal during transition  we sold million shares of efficient common stock and tendered our remaining million shares for proceeds of million in connection with a tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of efficient common stock made by siemens ag in connection with these transactions  we recognized the remaining deferred gain of million to other income 
additionally  the outstanding call options discussed above expired between march  and december   and we 
table of contents recognized the previously recorded deferred gain of  net of the related transaction costs of million  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during transition year on february   we sold our manufacturing and repair services operations located in rochester  new hampshire and limerick  ireland to flextronics for approximately million 
flextronics purchased  at net book value  approximately million of our manufacturing related fixed assets including buildings  approximately million of inventory  assumed leases on certain leased buildings and acquired manufacturing related employees 
simultaneously  we entered into an agreement with flextronics to manufacture most of our products 
our original agreement with flextronics ended on march  and has been extended on a month to month basis 
liquidity and capital resources we hold our cash and cash equivalents with banking institutions and money management firms that invest primarily in highly rated short and medium term debt securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
in connection with the issuance of letters of credit by several banking institutions  we have agreed to maintain specified amounts of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in collateral accounts controlled by those institutions 
the assets totalled million at december  a summary of liquid investments follows december  march  in millions restated cash and cash equivalents marketable securities long term marketable securities total liquid investments represents highly rated debt securities of the us government or its agencies that are expected to be held until maturity or are readily convertible into cash or cash equivalents 
includes efficient common stock that was sold during transition for net proceeds of million 
our total liquid investments decreased by million during transition we realized million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee purchases of common stock 
offsetting these proceeds were the following uses of cash i million of net cash used in operating activities  ii the allocation and distribution of million of liquid investments to riverstone and aprisma  of which million was returned to us by aprisma in march  iii capital expenditures of million  and iv investments of million 
in addition  under the terms of a previously authorized share repurchase program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock during fiscal at a total cost of million 
we have no current plans to make additional share repurchases 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million at december  compared with million at march  the decline in accounts receivable is due primarily to the decline in net revenue in transition and a million reduction to the accounts receivable balance at december  for shipments to stocking distributors that will not be recognized as revenue until our products are sold to their customers 
we anticipate that in the future our accounts receivable balance will fluctuate at approximately the same rate of change as our revenue 
inventories were million at december   or turns per annum  compared with million  or turns per annum  at march  the lower inventory turnover rate in transition was due to high inventory balances caused by sales forecasts and contractual purchase commitments that were higher than our actual sales 
we believe that our inventory turnover rate will improve in the future as we implement better forecasting procedures and restructure arrangements with our contract manufacturers 

table of contents our capital expenditures in transition  fiscal and fiscal were  and million  respectively and related primarily to information technology purchases and upgrades  equipment and software used in research and development activities  and facility related expenditures 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will be higher than the amounts incurred during transition primarily due to fiscal being two months longer than transition our liquid investments as defined in the table above have increased approximately million during the first three quarters of fiscal as a result of approximately million in net income tax refunds after payments for a prior period audit settlement and approximately million received from aprisma prior to  and in conjunction with  its sale 
offsetting these inflows were on going losses from operations  severance costs associated with further workforce reductions  legal  accounting and additional audit fees related to the internal review of our past accounting practices  payments to contract manufacturers to purchase excess raw materials  and capital expenditures 
we are focused on achieving cash positive operations in the near term and believe we have made  and will continue to make  substantial progress toward that goal 
in the third quarter of fiscal our net use of cash declined to approximately million  including approximately million of non recurring items 
based on our current liquid investment position and million of estimated federal income tax refunds that we expect to receive in relating to losses expected to be incurred in  we believe that we have sufficient liquid investments to fund our on going operations and future obligations for the foreseeable future 
the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments less than over contractual cash obligations total year years years years in millions potential series d e preferred stock redemption non cancelable lease obligations non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations total amounts less than over other commercial commitments committed year years years years in millions aprisma lease payment guarantees equipment lease guarantees letters of credit venture capital commitments n a n a n a n a total commercial commitments beginning on february   the holders of our series d and e preferred stock have the right to redeem these shares for approximately million in cash  less the proceeds from the sale of the approximately million shares of riverstone stock distributed to them in connection with our spin off of riverstone 
we expect to engage in discussions with the preferred stockholders concerning alternatives to this potential redemption right  although there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such discussions 
aprisma lease obligations of million are offset by full rights of indemnification 
the aprisma lease has a remaining term of approximately nine years 
we committed to make up to million of additional capital contributions to a venture capital fund in which we already are an investor 
in the event of future capital calls  we could be required to fund some 
table of contents or all of this commitment 
if we fail to make a required contribution  then our existing investment would be significantly diluted 
the fund has indicated that it does not anticipate issuing a capital call in the near future

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method  modifies the criteria for recognizing intangible assets  and expands disclosure requirements 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and intangible assets that will not be amortized for impairment 
in addition  sfas no 
expands the disclosure requirements about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year ending december  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  will be subject immediately to the provisions of sfas no 
impairment losses for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of sfas no 
are to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle 
subsequent impairment losses are to be included in income from operations 
our annual impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs  however  the application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
for goodwill is expected to result in a decrease in the loss from operations of approximately million per quarter in fiscal year we are presently assessing the impact of the new impairment rules 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires recognition of asset retirement obligations as a liability rather than a contra asset 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year ending january  any impact that adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements will be based on future transactions 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which excludes from the definition of long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires long lived assets disposed of by sale to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year  and early adoption is encouraged 
we do not anticipate any adjustment to the book value of its long lived assets as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item and amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have 
table of contents economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
we do not expect this statement will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force of the fasb issued eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendors products 
this eitf is effective for annual and interim financial statements beginning after december  eitf no 
 as further defined by eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  requires among other things  that payments made to resellers by us for cooperative advertising  buy downs and similar arrangements should be classified as reductions to net sales or an increase in selling expenses  depending upon the application of the funds by the customer 
we adopted this consensus in the first quarter of fiscal year if this standard had been adopted at december   including required retroactive application to prior periods  net revenue would have been reduced by million for the ten month period ended december   million for the fiscal years ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended february  cost of revenues would have been reduced by million for the ten month period ended december   million for the fiscal years ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended february  selling  general and administrative expenses would have been increased by million for the ten month period ended december   million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and february   respectively 
the above reclassification would have had no impact on net loss or loss per share 
in july the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when a liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 

table of contents cautionary statements we may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings  including this transition report on form k  and press releases made by us and in oral statements made by our officers 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statement include  among other things  the risks described below 
risks related to our financial results and condition the sec investigation and our accounting restatements could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition the uncertainty associated with the sec investigation into our accounting practices and the restatement of our financial statements could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
in particular  this uncertainty could harm our relationships with existing customers and impair our ability to attract new customers 
purchasing decisions by potential and existing customers have been and may continue to be postponed  we believe in part due to the sec investigation 
if potential and existing customers lose confidence in us  our competitive position in the networking industry may be seriously harmed and our revenues could decline 
in addition  this uncertainty has caused significant declines in our stock price  and continued uncertainty or negative developments could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 
our prior announcements regarding the sec investigation into our accounting practices and the restatement of financial results have led to several class action lawsuits alleging violations of the securities laws against us  as well as derivative actions against our board of directors 
the restatement of our financial statements may lead to new litigation  may strengthen and expand the claims and the class period in pending litigation  and may increase the cost of defending or resolving current litigation 
we expect that resolution of these lawsuits will continue to involve significant management time and attention and significant expenses for professional fees  and could lead to the payment of significant damages  any of which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the findings of the internal review initiated by our board of directors  individuals identified as having participated in  or who reasonably should have known about conduct contrary to our internal policies  have left our organization  have been terminated or have otherwise been disciplined 
we have also instituted new policies and procedures designed to enhance our ability to monitor and enforce our revenue recognition policies worldwide 
in addition  between march and october of  several of our executive officers resigned and were replaced with new management 
in october  our vice president of finance was promoted to the position of chief financial officer 
we also hired new managers in several senior finance and operations capacities and bolstered our finance staff in several key areas 
in addition  we added an internal audit director who reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors as well as to our chief financial officer 
however  our new management team has limited experience working together  and they  and our new policies and procedures  may not enable us to prevent or timely identify future accounting irregularities 
the sec investigation remains pending and continues to require significant management attention and resources 
an adverse finding by the sec may lead to significant fines and penalties  as well as limitations on our activities and our inability to rely on certain securities law safe harbors available to other companies 
the filing of our restated financial statements to correct the discovered accounting irregularities will not necessarily resolve the pending sec investigation into our accounting practices 
the resolution of the sec investigation could require the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements  and or our restated financial statements  or require that we take other actions not presently contemplated 

table of contents worldwide economic weakness and deteriorating market conditions have and may continue to negatively affect our business and revenues and make forecasting more difficult  which could harm our financial condition our business is subject to the effects of general worldwide economic conditions  particularly in the united states and emea  and market conditions in the networking industry  which have been particularly unfavorable 
recent political and social turmoil  such as terrorist and military actions  may put further pressure on worldwide economic conditions 
if economic or market conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  revenues  and forecasting ability will continue to be negatively affected  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
market conditions in the networking industry have been particularly unfavorable over the past two years  as companies have been reluctant to invest in their network infrastructures in light of continued economic uncertainty 
in recent quarters  our product revenues have declined as a result of reduced capital spending and a lengthened sales cycle attributable to unfavorable economic and market conditions as well as other factors 
continued economic weakness could result in increased price competition in our industry and could further reduce demand for our products  either of which could harm our revenues and reduce our gross margin 
these unfavorable political  social and economic conditions and uncertainties also make it extremely difficult for us  our customers and our vendors to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
in particular  it is difficult for us to develop and implement strategies  forecast demand for our products  and effectively manage contract manufacturing and supply chain relationships 
this reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business 
we have a history of losses in recent years and may not operate profitably in the future we have experienced losses in recent years and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will need to generate higher revenues and reduce our costs to achieve and maintain consistent profitability 
we may not be able to generate higher revenues or reduce our costs  and if we do achieve consistent profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability over subsequent periods 
our revenues have been negatively affected by weaker economic conditions worldwide  which have reduced demand and increased price competition for most of our products  as well as resulted in longer selling cycles 
if weaker worldwide economic conditions continue for an extended period of time  our ability to maintain and increase our revenues may be significantly limited 
in addition  while we recently implemented a cost reduction plan designed to decrease our expenses  which included a significant reduction in the size of our workforce and the sale of our operating subsidiary  aprisma  we will continue to have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development  customer support and service and other expenses 
we continue to assess whether additional cost cutting efforts may be required 
additional cost cutting efforts may result in the recording of additional charges  such as workforce reduction costs  facilities reduction costs  asset write downs and contractual settlements 
further  our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives  and costs incurred in connection with our cost cutting efforts may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and may not lead to anticipated cost savings 
as a result  our cost cutting efforts may not result in a return to profitability 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate  which could cause us to fail to meet quarterly operating targets and result in a decline in our stock price our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated organizational size and revenue trends  and a high percentage of these expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter 
any revenue shortfall in a quarter may thus cause our financial results for that quarter to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
any increase in our fixed expenses will increase the magnitude of this 
table of contents risk 
in addition  the unpredictability of our operating results from quarter to quarter could cause our stock to trade at lower prices than it would if our results were consistent from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a number of factors  including fluctuations in the demand for our products and services  the timing and size of sales of our products or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  the timing of implementation and product acceptance by our customers and by customers of our distribution partners  the timing and success of new product introductions  the timing and level of non cash  stock based compensation charges  increases in the prices or decreases in the availability of the components we purchase  price and product competition in the networking industry  our ability to source and receive from third party sources appropriate product volumes and quality  manufacturing lead times and our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels  the timing and level of research  development and prototype expenses  the mix of products and services sold  changes in the distribution channels through which we sell our products and the loss of distribution partners  the uncertainties inherent in our accounting estimates and assumptions and the impact of changes in accounting principles  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  the outcome of pending securities litigation and the pending sec investigation into our accounting practices  and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the networking industry 
due to these and other factors  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of our future performance 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue for each quarter in the last month of each quarter  which reduces our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly results and increases the risk that we will be unable to achieve previously forecasted results we have derived and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter  with such revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of the quarter 
because we rely on the generation of a large portion of revenues at the end of the quarter  we traditionally have not been able  and in the future do not expect to be able  to predict our financial results for any quarter until very late in the quarter 
due to this end of quarter buying pattern  we may not achieve our financial forecasts  either because expected sales do not occur in the anticipated quarter or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us than anticipated 

table of contents we may need additional capital to fund our future operations  commitments and contingencies and  if it is not available when needed  our business may be harmed we believe our existing working capital  cash available from operations and anticipated tax refunds will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our working capital requirements and cash flows historically have been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on such factors as capital expenditures  sales levels  collection of receivables  inventory levels  supplier terms and obligations  and other factors impacting our financial performance and condition 
also  in february  the holders of our series d and e preferred stock have the right to redeem these shares from us for cash 
this redemption could require that we pay them up to million in cash for their shares 
our inability to manage cash flow fluctuations resulting from these and other factors could impair our ability to fund our working capital requirements from operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity or to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
we have not established any borrowing relationships with financial institutions and are primarily reliant on cash generated from operations to meet our cash requirements 
if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash must be used for currently unanticipated uses  we may need to raise additional capital or reduce our expenses 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
as a result of the current unfavorable market environment  as well as the sec investigation into our accounting practices and related litigation  our ability to access the capital markets and establish borrowing relationships with financial institutions has been impaired and may continue to be impaired for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed or must reduce our expenses  it is likely that our product development and marketing efforts will be restricted  which would harm our ability to develop new and enhanced products  expand our distribution relationships and customer base  and establish our brand name 
this could adversely impact our competitive position and cause our revenues to decline 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  existing stockholders may suffer dilution 
also  these securities may provide the holders with certain rights  privileges and preferences senior to those of common stockholders 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
in february  the holders of our series d and e preferred stock may require redemption of their shares for cash  which could impair our cash position  or request the conversion of their shares into shares of our common stock  which would dilute our existing stockholders in february  the holders of our series d and e preferred stock have the right to redeem these shares for cash 
this redemption could require us to pay them up to approximately million in cash for their shares less proceeds from the sale of the riverstone shares they received in the riverstone spin off  which could impair our cash position 
if we fail to redeem the series d and e shares  pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation the series d and e preferred stock will become convertible into a much larger number of shares of our common stock than it is currently convertible into  which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders 
upon our failure to redeem  these shares would be convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock  resulting in these holders holding of our outstanding common stock  based on the closing price of our common stock of per share and approximately million shares outstanding on october  it is also possible that  as an alternative to the foregoing  we may renegotiate the terms of the series d and e preferred stock with the holders 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in renegotiating the terms 
any renegotiations will likely result in terms less favorable to us that the current terms 
pending and future litigation could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition several lawsuits have been filed against us and our directors in recent years  including nine shareholder class action lawsuits filed between october  and march   and  more recently  
table of contents six shareholder class action lawsuits filed between february  and april   as well as shareholder derivative actions filed in the state of new hampshire on february  and in the state of delaware on april  we may be required to pay significant damages as a result of these lawsuits 
we are and may in the future be subject to other litigation arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with the recent restatement of our financial statements 
the uncertainty associated with these lawsuits could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation by  among other things  harming our relationships with existing customers and impairing our ability to attract new customers 
in addition  the continued defense of these lawsuits will result in significant expense and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives 
the unfavorable resolution of any specific lawsuit could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition  and could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
the limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may materially harm our financial condition our director and officer liability insurance for the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors are alleged to have occurred  provides only limited liability protection 
if these policies do not adequately cover expenses and certain liabilities relating to these lawsuits  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by delaware law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by a person  by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to be a director or officer  in connection with the investigation  defense and settlement of any threatened  pending or completed action  suit  proceeding or claim 
the facts underlying the sec investigation and shareholder lawsuits will likely increase the premiums we must pay for director and officer liability insurance in the future  and may make this insurance coverage prohibitively expensive or unavailable 
increased premiums for this insurance could materially harm our financial results in future periods 
the inability to obtain this coverage due to its unavailability or prohibitively expensive premiums would make it more difficult for us to retain and attract officers and directors 
our failure to improve our management information systems and internal controls could harm our business we currently use three disparate information systems in our domestic and international operations  resulting in delays in obtaining consistent and timely information on a worldwide basis and use of extensive manual procedures to generate our consolidated financial results 
further  our systems do not provide all of the information that we believe is necessary to successfully operate our business  and we have identified weaknesses in our internal controls and accounting procedures 
we have implemented a number of changes designed to improve our information systems and controls  including organizational changes  communication of revenue recognition and other accounting policies to all of our employees  implementation of an internal audit function  new approval procedures and various other initiatives 
we are evaluating additional changes which may require us to make investments in our systems and controls  which could result in higher future operating expenses and capital expenditures 
if we fail to strengthen our management information systems and internal controls  our ability to manage our business and implement our strategies may be impaired and our financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  even if we are successful in strengthening these systems and controls  they may not sufficiently improve our ability to manage our business and implement our strategies  or be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities 

table of contents we have experienced significant turnover of senior management and our current management team has been together for only a limited time  which could harm our business and operations in connection with the merger of enterasys subsidiary into us in august  our management team was restructured to include several senior enterasys subsidiary executives 
in april  we announced the departure of several of these senior executives  including our president and chief executive officer 
in october  our vice president of finance was promoted to the position of chief financial officer 
because of these recent changes and their recent recruitment  our current management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully develop and implement business strategies 
in addition  as a result of these management changes  management will need to devote significant attention and resources to preserve and strengthen relationships with employees and customers 
if our new management team is unable to develop successful business strategies  achieve our business objectives  or maintain positive relationships with employees and customers  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be impaired 
retaining key management and employees is critical to our success our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  many of whom have significant experience with the network communications market  as well as relationships with many of our existing and potential enterprise customers and business partners 
the loss of several of our key employees or any significant portion of them could have a significant detrimental effect on our ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  assimilate and retain large numbers of highly qualified engineering  sales  marketing  managerial and support personnel 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain such persons  particularly in our engineering and sales departments  our development and introduction of new products could be delayed and our ability to compete successfully could be impaired 
despite the current economic downturn  the competition for qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in the new england area  where our principal operations are located  and it can be difficult to attract and retain quality employees at reasonable cost 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
in addition  the significant downturn in our business environment has caused us to significantly reduce our workforce and implement other cost containment activities  including consolidating our operating locations and relocating some of our personnel to rochester  new hampshire and andover  massachusetts 
these actions  as well as the pending sec investigation of our accounting practices and shareholder litigation  may lead to disruptions in our business  reduced employee morale and productivity  increased attrition and difficulty retaining existing employees and recruiting future employees  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we maintain strategic investments in early stage  privately held technology companies to establish relationships that we believe may benefit us as we execute our business strategy  but these relationships may not prove helpful to us  and we could lose our entire investment in these companies we have made strategic investments in privately held technology companies and value added resellers  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
the benefits we expected to achieve by investing in these companies may not be realized 
moreover  investments in these companies are inherently risky as the technologies or products they have under development  or the services they propose to provide  are often in early stages of development and may never materialize 
we may never realize any benefits or financial returns from these investments  and  if these companies are not successful  we could lose our entire investment 
the concentration of our investments in a small number of related industries  primarily telecommunications  exposes our investments to increased risk  particularly if these industries continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide economic slowdown 
at december   these investments totaled approximately million 
during the ten month transition period ended december   we recorded impairment losses of million relating to these investments 

table of contents we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers our payment terms are typically days in the united states  and sometimes longer internationally 
we assess the payment ability of our customers in granting such terms and maintain reserves that we believe are adequate to cover doubtful accounts  however  as a result of the current economic slowdown  our exposure to the credit risk of our customers has increased 
some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience  reduced revenues and cash flow problems  and may be unable to pay  or may delay payment for  amounts owed to us 
although we monitor the credit risk of our customers  we may not be effective in managing our exposure 
if our customers are unable to pay amounts owed to us or cancel outstanding orders  our forecasting ability  cash flow and revenues could be harmed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes in effective tax rates  failure to realize anticipated tax refunds and adverse results of future tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations our future effective tax rates  and our results of operations  could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuations of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected and our business harmed if the amount of federal income tax refunds from anticipated losses in fiscal are lower than we anticipate as a result of our estimates regarding our anticipated losses in fiscal are incorrect or if future federal or local tax audits result in our paying significant additional taxes 
risks related to the markets for our products there is intense competition in the market for enterprise network equipment  which could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability the network communications market is dominated by a small number of competitors  some of which  cisco systems in particular  have substantially greater resources and market share than other participants in that market  including us 
in addition  this market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
competitive pressures could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  which would materially harm our ability to increase revenues and profitability 
our principal competitors include alcatel  avaya  formerly part of lucent  cisco systems  extreme networks  foundry networks  hewlett packard  nortel networks  and com 
we also experience competition from a number of other smaller public and private companies 
we may experience reluctance by our prospective customers to replace or expand their current infrastructure solutions  which may be supplied by one or more of these competitors  with our products 
there has also been a trend toward consolidation in our industry for several years  and we expect this trend will continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market share positions 
consolidation among our competitors and potential competitors may result in stronger competitors with expanded product offerings and a greater ability to accelerate their development of new technologies 
some of our competitors have significantly more established customer support and professional services organizations and substantially greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors also have more customers  greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop  enhance and expand their product offerings more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  pursue acquisitions and other opportunities more readily and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter our rapidly evolving market  thereby further intensifying competition 

table of contents we may be unable to expand our indirect distribution channels  which may hinder our ability to grow our customer base and increase our revenues our sales and distribution strategy relies heavily on our indirect sales efforts  including sales through distributors and channel partners  such as value added resellers  systems integrators and telecommunications service providers 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and expand existing relationships  as well as establish successful new relationships  with a variety of these partners 
if we are unable to expand our indirect distribution channels  we may be unable to increase or sustain market awareness or sales of our products and services  which may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our customer base and revenues 
even if we are able to expand our indirect distribution channels  our revenues may not increase 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from selling products and services that compete with ours and may not devote adequate resources to selling our products and services 
in addition  we may be unable to maintain our existing agreements or reach new agreements with distribution partners on a timely basis or at all 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease over time  which may reduce our revenue and gross margins our industry has experienced erosion of average selling prices in recent years  particularly as products reach the end of their life cycles 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to increased sales discounts and new product or technology introductions by us and our competitors 
our prices will also likely be adversely affected by downturns in regional or industry economies  such as the recent downturn in the united states economy 
we also expect our gross margins may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs and an increasing reliance on third party distribution channels 
if we are unable to achieve commensurate cost reductions and increases in sales volumes  any decline in average selling prices will reduce our revenues and gross margins 
if we do not anticipate and respond to technological developments and evolving customer requirements  we may not retain our current customers or attract new customers the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction by us or our competitors of new products and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and functionality that keep pace with technological developments and emerging standards 
any failure to introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis will harm our future revenue and prospects 
our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and manage customer relationships and to introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our current and prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our products do not have 
we must anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products that meet those demands in a timely manner 
our failure to develop products that satisfy evolving customer requirements could seriously harm our ability to achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and prevent us from recovering our product development investments 
we may expend significant resources educating potential customers about our products without achieving actual sales purchases of our products often represent a significant capital investment by our customers related to their enterprise network infrastructure 
they are often subject to budgetary constraints and typically involve significant internal procedures involving the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
we typically must provide a significant level of education to enterprises on the benefits of our products and services  which often results in a lengthy sales process 
during this time we may incur 
table of contents substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
if we fail to recognize revenue from a particular customer after making such a substantial investment  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
our focus on sales to enterprise customers subjects us to risks that may be greater than those for providers with a more diverse customer base we focus principally on sales of products and services to enterprises  such as large corporations and government agencies that rely on network communications for many important aspects of their operations 
this focus subjects us to risks that are particular to this customer segment 
for example  many of our current and potential customers are health care  education and governmental agencies  all of whom are generally slower to incorporate information technology into their business practices due to the regulatory and privacy issues that must be addressed with respect to the sharing of their information 
in addition  the use and growth of the internet is critical to enterprises  which often have electronic networks  applications and other mission critical functions that use the internet 
to the extent that there is any decline in use of the internet for electronic commerce or communications  for whatever reason  including performance  reliability or security concerns  we may experience decreased demand for our products and lower than expected revenue growth 
many of our competitors sell their products to both enterprises and service providers  which are companies who provide internet based services to businesses and individuals 
in the future  the demand for network communications products from enterprises may not grow as rapidly as the demand from service providers 
enterprises may turn to service providers to supply them with services that obviate the need for enterprises to implement many of our solutions 
because we sell our products primarily to enterprises  our exposure to these risks is greater than that of vendors that sell to a more diversified customer base 
risks related to our products our products are very complex  and undetected defects may increase our costs  harm our reputation with our customers and lead to costly litigation our network communications products are extremely complex and must operate successfully with complex products of other vendors 
our products may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as we introduce product upgrades 
the pressures we face to be the first to market new products or functionality increases the possibility that we will offer products in which we or our customers later discover problems 
we have experienced new product and product upgrade errors in the past and expect similar problems in the future 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and other costs and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
if we are unable to repair these problems in a timely manner  we may experience a loss of or delay in revenues and significant damage to our reputation and business prospects 
many of our customers rely upon our products for business critical applications 
because of this reliance  errors  defects or other performance problems in our products could result in significant financial and other damage to our customers 
our customers could attempt to recover these losses by pursuing product liability claims against us  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our reputation 
if our products do not comply with complex governmental regulations and evolving industry standards  our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability the market for network communications equipment is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
in the past  we have had to delay the introduction of new products to comply with third party standards testing 
we may be unable to address compatibility and interoperability problems that arise from technological changes and evolving industry standards 
we also may devote significant resources developing products designed to meet 
table of contents standards that are not widely adopted 
in the united states  our products must comply with various governmental regulations and industry regulations and standards  including those defined by the federal communications commission  underwriters laboratories and networking equipment building standards 
internationally  our products are required to comply with standards or obtain certifications established by telecommunications authorities in various countries and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards  fail to anticipate correctly which standards will be widely adopted or fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we will be unable to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability 
the united states government may impose unique requirements on network equipment providers before they are permitted to sell to the government  such as that supplied products qualify as made in the united states 
such requirements may be imposed on some or all government procurements 
we may not always satisfy all such requirements 
other governments or industries may establish similar performance requirements or tests that we may be unable to satisfy 
if we are unable to satisfy the performance or other requirements of the united states government or other industries that establish them  our revenues growth may be lower than expected 
because several of our significant competitors maintain dominant positions in selling network equipment products to enterprises and others  they may have the ability to establish de facto standards within the industry 
any actions by these competitors or other industry leaders that diminish compliance by our products with industry or de facto standards or the ability of our products to interoperate with other network communication products would be damaging to our reputation and our ability to generate revenue 
we intend to work with other companies to develop products  which increases our reliance on others for generating revenues and may lead to disputes about ownership of intellectual property we intend to establish strategic partnerships with industry leading organizations in complementary markets to incorporate our network communications technology into products and solutions sold by these organizations 
we may be unable to enter into agreements of this type on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are able to enter into these agreements  we will likely be unable to control the amount and timing of resources our partners devote to developing products that incorporate our technology and the efforts they devote to selling these products 
if we are unable to enter into these agreements on favorable terms  or if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to developing and selling the products that incorporate our technology  our revenue growth will be lower than expected 
although we intend to retain all rights in our technology in these arrangements  we may be unable to negotiate the retention of these rights 
furthermore  disputes may arise over the ownership of technology developed as a result of these partnerships 
these and other potential disagreements between us and these partners could lead to delays in the research  development or sale of products we are developing with them or more serious disputes  which may be costly to resolve 
disputes with partners who also serve as indirect distribution channels for our products could reduce our revenues from sales of our products 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may hinder our ability to compete we regard our products and technology as proprietary 
we attempt to protect them through a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products or technology without authorization  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  or to develop similar technology independently 
we have resorted to litigation in the past and may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and 
table of contents scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property infringes upon the proprietary rights of others  and a successful claim could harm our ability to sell and develop our products we license technology from third parties and are continuing to develop and acquire additional intellectual property 
although we have not been involved in any material litigation relating to our intellectual property  we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
third parties may try to claim our products infringe their intellectual property  in which case we would be forced to defend ourselves or our customers  manufacturers and suppliers against those claims 
any claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  in which case we would have to cease selling  incorporating or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property and expend substantial amounts of resources to redesign our products 
if we are forced to enter into unacceptable royalty or licensing agreements or to redesign our products  our business and prospects would suffer 
we jointly own with riverstone some of our intellectual property  and our business could be harmed if riverstone uses this intellectual property to compete with us in the transformation agreement among aprisma  riverstone and us and the related contribution agreements  each of we  aprisma and riverstone received intellectual property related to the products to be sold by each of us or to be used in each of our respective businesses 
in addition  we and riverstone both own rights in technology within a family of application specific integrated circuits used in both our x pedition product family and riverstone s switch router product family 
riverstone is primarily a provider of infrastructure equipment to service providers in metropolitan area networks 
there are no contractual provisions between us and riverstone that prohibit riverstone from developing products that are competitive with our products  including products based upon these commonly owned rights 
if riverstone is acquired by one of our competitors  there are no contractual provisions that would prohibit the combined entity from selling or developing products competitive with our products 
risks related to our manufacturing and components we use several key components for our products that we purchase from single or limited sources  and we could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs we currently work with third parties to manufacture our key proprietary application specific integrated circuits  which are custom designed circuits built to perform a specific function more rapidly than a general purpose microprocessor 
these proprietary circuits are very complex  and these third parties are our sole source suppliers for the specific types of application specific integrated circuits that they supply to us 
we also have limited sources for the semiconductor chips that we use in our wireless roamabout solution  as well as several other key components used in the manufacture of our products 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components  and we do not have a long term  fixed price or minimum volume agreements with these suppliers 
if we encounter future problems with these vendors  we likely would not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner 
we have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining these components in the past and may experience similar shortages and delays in the future 
if we are unable to purchase our critical components  particularly our application specific integrated circuits  at such times and in such volumes as our business requires  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in accordance with schedule requirements 
in addition  any delay in obtaining key components for new products under development could cause a significant delay in the initial launch of these products 
any delay in the launch of new products could harm our reputation and operating results 

table of contents even if we are able to obtain these components in sufficient volumes and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we have little control over their cost 
accordingly  the lack of alternative sources for these components may force us to pay higher prices for them 
if we are unable to obtain these components from our current suppliers or others at economical prices  our margins could be adversely impacted unless we raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner 
the existing competitive conditions may not permit us to do so  in which case our operating results may suffer 
we depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements  and the loss of our primary contract manufacturer would impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing to one company  flextronics international  ltd  which procures material on our behalf and provides comprehensive manufacturing services  including assembly  test  control and shipment to our customers 
our agreement with flextronics expired in february and  since that time  we have been operating under an informal extension of the expired contract while negotiating a new agreement with flextronics 
our secondary contract manufacturer is accton technology corporation  which provides services similar to those of flextronics 
if we experience increased demand for our products  we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity with flextronics and accton or add additional contract manufacturers 
flextronics and accton also build products for other companies  and we cannot be certain that they will always have sufficient quantities of inventory and capacity available or that they will allocate their internal resources to fulfill our requirements 
further  qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
the loss of our existing contract manufacturers  the failure of our existing contract manufacturers to satisfy their contractual obligations to us or our failure to timely qualify a new contract manufacturer to meet anticipated demand increases could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our products 
in this event  we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays we use a forward looking forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our product requirements for our contract manufacturer 
the lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
for example  some of our application specific integrated circuits have a lead time of up to eight months 
if we overestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which we may be obligated to pay for 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could result in delays in delivery to our customers and our recognition of revenue 
in addition  because our contract manufacturers produce our products based on forward looking demand projections that we supply to them  we may be unable to respond quickly to sudden changes in demand 
for example  following the events of september   we experienced a sudden drop in demand for our products and were unable to reduce the amount of product manufactured by our contract manufacturers in the short term  which were based on demand forecasts provided prior to the sudden change in demand 
this contributed to a million charge for inventory obsolescence in transition with respect to sudden increases in demand  we may be unable to satisfy this demand with our products  thereby forfeiting revenue opportunities and damaging our customer relationships  and with respect to sudden decreases in demand  we may find ourselves with excess finished goods inventory  which could expose us to high manufacturing costs compared to our revenue in a financial quarter and increased risks of inventory obsolescence 

table of contents other risks related to our business our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations our sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenue in the ten months ended december   of our revenue in the fiscal year ended march  and of our revenue in the fiscal year ended february  we are seeking to expand our international presence by establishing arrangements with distribution partners as well as through strategic relationships in international markets 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
as a result  increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could result in reductions in sales and profitability 
to the extent our prices or expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
our international presence subjects us to risks  including political and economic instability and changing regulatory environments in foreign countries  increased time to deliver solutions to customers due to the complexities associated with managing an international distribution system  increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices in many international markets  managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries  and political and economic instability 
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile  and the recent decline in the market price of our common stock may negatively impact our ability to make future strategic acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt  and retain employees shares of our common stock have experienced  and may continue to experience  substantial price volatility  including significant recent decreases  particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts  announcements by our competitors and us  economic weakness and political instability  high turnover in our senior management  the pending sec investigation of our accounting practices  and class action lawsuits recently filed against us 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies 
these price fluctuations have  in some cases  been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
a major decline in capital markets generally  or in the market price of our shares of common stock  may negatively impact our ability to make future strategic acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt  or retain employees 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions and the outcome of the pending sec investigation and class action lawsuits  may in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the new york stock exchange  and if we fail to do so  the price and liquidity of our common stock may decline the new york stock exchange has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the exchange  including a requirement that we maintain a minimum day average 
table of contents closing price per share of 
throughout much of  our stock has traded below per share 
recently  the day average closing price per share of our common stock fell below  and we received a notice from the new york stock exchange that our continued listing is under review 
although we are currently in compliance with the day average closing price requirement  we must also meet this requirement six months from receipt of the new york stock exchange notice to maintain our listing 
the new york stock exchange recently proposed significant amendments to its rules relating to corporate governance 
the proposed amendments to such rules  if adopted  will require us to make a number of changes in our business in order to remain in compliance 
as a result  we are currently evaluating our compliance with the proposed rule changes to ensure our ability to comply with the proposed rules  however  we cannot assure you that  if the proposed rules are adopted  we will be able to achieve or maintain compliance with them 
if we fail to maintain the continued listing of our shares on the new york stock exchange  our stock price would likely decline  the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell shares of our common stock may be materially impaired and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock would be adversely affected 
in addition  delisting of our shares could harm our ability to recruit directors and employees  diminish customer confidence in us  harming our revenues and our financial condition  and would significantly impair our ability to raise capital in the public markets should we desire to do so in the future 
we have changed our name and the names of some of our products  and our existing and potential customers and business partners may not recognize our new brand  which could adversely affect our sales and marketing efforts and cause our revenue to decline before the transformation  we sold our products and services under the cabletron name  and we believe that the sale of our products and services significantly benefited from the use of the cabletron brand name 
we now sell our products and services under our new name  enterasys and have also changed the names of some of our products 
our existing and potential customers and business partners and investors may not recognize our new brand or the new names of our products 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing expenses to build a strong new brand identity 
the expenses we incur toward building our brand  however  will not result in immediate returns and it may be a long time before enterprises and business partners recognize and make positive connections with our new brand 
if we fail to promote our new brand and new product names successfully in local and international markets  our business may suffer 
the tax implications of riverstone spin off may place restrictions on us and subject us to risks we have received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the distribution of riverstone qualifies as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
rulings and opinions of this nature are subject to various representations and limitations  and in any event  are not binding upon the internal revenue service or any court 
if the distribution of riverstone s shares fails to qualify as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code  we will recognize a taxable gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of riverstone on the date of the distribution and our adjusted tax basis in riverstone s stock on the date of the distribution 
in addition  each of our stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable corporate distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of riverstone s stock received by the stockholder on the date of distribution 
any taxable gain recognized by us or our stockholders as a result of a failure of the riverstone distribution to qualify as tax free under section is likely to be substantial 
limitations under section of the internal revenue code may restrict our ability to use our capital stock following the riverstone distribution 
these limitations will generally prevent us from issuing capital stock if the issuance of the capital stock occurs in conjunction with the riverstone distribution  and results in one or more persons acquiring more than of our capital stock 
stock issuance transactions which occur during the two years following any distribution are presumed to occur in conjunction with the 
table of contents distribution 
these limitations may restrict our ability to undertake transactions involving the issuance of our capital stock that we believe would be beneficial 
we have made and may make future acquisitions  which involve numerous risks we have supplemented and may further supplement our internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we may be unable to identify and acquire suitable candidates on reasonable terms  if at all 
our financial condition and stock price may make it difficult for us to complete acquisitions 
we compete for acquisition candidates with other companies that have substantially greater financial  management and other resources than we do 
this competition may increase the prices we pay to acquire other companies  which are often high when compared to the assets and sales of these companies 
our acquisitions may not generate sufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition in the short term or at all 
acquisitions  particularly multiple acquisitions over a short period of time  involve a number of risks that may result in our failure to achieve the desired benefits of the transaction 
these risks include  among others  the following difficulties and unanticipated costs incurred in assimilating the operations of the acquired businesses  potential disruption of our existing operations  an inability to integrate  train and retain key personnel  diversion of management attention and employees from day to day operations  an inability to incorporate  develop or market acquired technologies or products  unexpected liabilities of the acquired business  operating inefficiencies associated with managing companies in different locations  and impairment of relationships with employees  customers  suppliers and strategic partners 
we may finance acquisitions by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
we may also use cash or incur debt to pay for these acquisitions 
in addition  we may be required to expend substantial funds to develop acquired technologies or to amortize significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we have made acquisitions and may make future acquisitions that result in in process research and development expenses being charged in a particular quarter  which could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and our investor rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control  which could reduce our stock price pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than of the outstanding shares of our capital stock for the approval or authorization of certain business combinations as described in our certificate of incorporation 
in addition  our staggered board of directors and certain advance notification requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors contained in our bylaws  as well as other provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  could delay or make a change in control more difficult to accomplish 
in april  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record on june  as 
table of contents a result of the plan  our acquisition by a party not approved by our board of directors could be prohibitively expensive 
this plan is designed to protect stockholders from attempts to acquire us while our stock price is inappropriately low or on terms or through tactics that could deny all stockholders the opportunity to realize the full value of their investment 
under the plan  each right initially represents the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase  of a share of a new series of our preferred stock at an exercise price of per share 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the then outstanding shares of our common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in such person or group owning or more of our then outstanding common stock  each right would entitle its holder other than the holder or group which acquired or more of our common stock to purchase shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right 
our board of directors may redeem the rights at the redemption price of 
per right  subject to adjustment  at any time prior to the earlier of june   the expiration date of the rights  or the date of distribution of the rights  as determined under the plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting partly of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the securities that we classify as held to maturity are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities are not material 
the securities that we classify as available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax as a component of stockholders equity 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately million decrease in the fair market value of these securities from their value at the december  we are able to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio  unless we are required to liquidate these securities earlier to satisfy immediate cash flow requirements 
foreign currency exchange risk 
due to our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had net asset exposures to the australian dollar  eurodollar  japanese yen and brazilian real and a net liability exposure to the british pound 
we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to minimize the potential adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we  at times  have used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk inherent in our global operations 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
gains and losses on these contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we had no foreign exchange forward or option contracts outstanding at december  equity price risk 
we maintain a small amount of investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
as of december   these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies as part of our investment strategy 
in the past  we have also made strategic equity and convertible debt investments in privately held technology companies  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
investments in these 
table of contents companies are highly illiquid and inherently risky as the technologies or products they have under development  or the services they propose to provide  are typically in early stages of development and may never materialize 
if these companies are not successful  we could lose our entire investment 
the concentration of our investments in a small number of related industries  primarily telecommunications  exposes our investments to increased risk  particularly if these industries continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide economic slowdown 
at december   these investments totaled approximately million 
during the ten month transition period ended december   we recorded impairment losses of million relating to these investments 
while our operating results may be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of these investments  we do not expect any material adverse impact in our cash flows
