liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations with the net proceeds from our initial public offering in of  shares of common stock aggregating  after payment of offering costs  approximately  and the june sale of our south florida wireless cable subsidiary for million in bellsouth common stock 
the proceeds have been used for  and are currently reserved to fund acquisitions of  healthcare e commerce investments  telecommunications assets  media businesses  development of our other businesses and development and acquisition of new technologies and businesses in other areas 
such amount  with earnings thereon including proceeds from sale of bellsouth common stock and related derivatives  is expected to be sufficient to implement this business plan through october  or for a shorter period if we determine to invest a substantial portion of our assets in major acquisitions  equity investments or stock repurchases 
we actively seek to acquire or invest in healthcare e commerce  other businesses in telecommunications  media or in unrelated areas 
we have no specific arrangements with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at the present time 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions or investments will be made 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of our common shares because we believe  under current market conditions  the repurchase is a favorable investment 
the repurchased shares will also be available for sale upon exercise of outstanding options 
through october   we repurchased  shares for an aggregate cost of  and  through january   we repurchased  additional shares for an aggregate cost of  as of october   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities  as well as our interest in ens and other investments 
during the year ended october   we closed portions of our option position in bellsouth common stock and sold shares of bellsouth common stock 
while we continue to review our position in bellsouth common stock and from time to time have sold and purchased shares and options on the position  we have not yet determined whether we will sell or hedge our remaining bellsouth securities in the near future or how we will invest the proceeds of any such sale 
in august and december   we purchased additional shares of common stock of ens from a stockholder in separate transactions  one for  cash and the other for  cash and a  contingent note  and we currently own of the outstanding diluted common stock of ens 
in the year ended october   we advanced an additional  to ens  for a total outstanding loan of  including accrued interest 
interest receivable by the company from ens increased by  to  at october  the outstanding balance under this loan agreement has been eliminated from the balance sheet in consolidation 
during  the company spent  on fixed assets  including  for internally developed software and  for computer equipment required for increased claims processing and the development of xpedite  our provider targeting and tracking system 
operating overhead costs of ens have increased in order to support its continued growth 
we anticipate related continued growth in revenues at ens in the near future 
operating overhead costs of ens have decreased as a result of cost cutting measures and production efficiencies gained 
we anticipate further increased revenues in the near future 
the combination of these factors going forward will improve overall profitability  allowing the company to sustain itself on cash flows from operations 
ens liquidity and capital resources ens losses have been financed principally through equity investments by the company and loans from the company  which loans aggregated  through september  including accrued interest of 
ens plans additional investment in its technology enhancements  including further development and implementation of xpedite  its full contact management operating system  its internet claims processing system  web enrollment  a remote internet based technology to enroll customers at time of sale  ect  an internet based full claims tracking system  additional payer connectivity  and enhancements to broaden the transactions processing infrastructure 
although we believe that ens may need to obtain additional financing to accelerate its strategic business plan based upon existing contracts with physicians  other providers  payers and management companies and current expense levels  management expects ens to continue profitable operations  established in the third quarter of fiscal  through fiscal quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities  other than activities relating to ens and potential acquisitions  is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our portfolio 
we also utilize derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to hedge our position in bellsouth common stock and reduce equity price risk 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the yield on our investments and the costs of derivative instruments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities other than bellsouth common stock and related derivatives in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds  highly liquid us treasury notes and federal agency notes and other low risk investments 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
the weighted average interest rate of the portfolio was at october  currently almost all our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we conduct only limited transactions in foreign currencies  and we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant in the foreseeable future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
