item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements statements contained in this report that are not historical fact including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities reform act of statements made that are not historical facts are forward looking and  accordingly  involve estimates  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results will depend  among other things  upon the actions of regulators  the outcome of litigation at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc involving the company s regulated companies  the performance of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant vermont yankee  weather conditions  the performance of the company s unregulated businesses and the state of the economy in the areas served 
the co mpany cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies used by the company 
regulation the company is subject to regulation by the vermont public service board  the new hampshire public utilities commission and the ferc  with respect to rates charged for service  accounting and other matters pertaining to regulated operations 
as such  the company currently prepares its financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  or sfas no 
 for both its regulated service territories and ferc regulated wholesale businesses 
in order for a company to report under sfas no 
 the company s rates must be designed to recover its costs of providing service and must be able to collect those rates from customers 
if rate recovery becomes unlikely or uncertain  whether due to competition or regulatory action  this accounting standard would no longer apply to the company s regulated operations 
in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying sfa s no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material 
management periodically reviews these criteria to ensure the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes future recovery of its regulatory assets in the state of vermont and the state of new hampshire for the company s retail and wholesale businesses are probable 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  including its investments in nuclear generating companies  its unregulated investments  and its interests in jointly owned generating facilities  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of such assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such an asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
purchased power the company records the annual cost of power obtained under long term contracts as operating expenses 
since these contracts do not convey to the company the right to use property  plant or equipment  they are considered executory in nature 
other other significant accounting policies include estimated unbilled revenues recorded at the end of each quarterly accounting period  depreciation based on the straight line remaining life method  and income taxes recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
earnings overview central vermont public service corporation s the company net income was million or 
per basic and diluted share of common stock  which equates to a consolidated return on average common equity 
this compares to net income and earnings per basic and diluted share of common stock of million and in  and million and in the consolidated return on average common equity was for and for excluding all nonrecurring items discussed below  the company s net income for was million  or per basic and diluted share of common stock 
this compares to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share of common stock  which excludes nonrecurring income related to the favorable millstone page of unit settlement and the favorable connecticut valley electric company connecticut valley first circuit court of appeals decision 
the company s rate case settlement with the vermont department of public service dps increased rates effective july   and put to rest the issues surrounding the vermont utilities power contract with hydro quebec 
as a result  the company was required to take a one time charge to earnings of million after tax  or 
per share  and had a million after tax  or 
per share  favorable impact due to the elimination of under recovery of costs related to the hydro quebec power contract 
during  the company s unregulated subsidiary  catamount energy corporation catamount  recorded fourth quarter after tax asset impairment charges of million  or 
per share  related to four of its investments in non regulated energy generation projects 
the impairment charges are the result of writing down two assets held for sale to estimated sales value and issues concerning the future viability of two other operating projects 
the company also had a third quarter extraordinary charge of million related to connecticut valley  which is again subject to cost based ratemaking 
earnings in included nonrecurring income related to the favorable millstone unit settlement and connecticut valley first circuit court of appeals decision  which are described below 
other factors affecting earnings compared to included higher retail sales revenue of million after tax  or 
per share  resulting from higher average retail rates due to the june  approved rate order  offset by a decrease in retail mwh sales  lower other utility revenues of million after tax  or 
per share  primarily due to a ferc ordered refund of transmission costs in the fourth quarter of  lower net power costs of million after tax  or 
per share  mostly related to lower vermont yankee operating and decommissioning costs  higher operating and other costs of million after tax  or 
per share  due to higher service restoration costs related to storm activity in the first quarter of and higher costs related to employee benefits  and lower net losses at eversant corporation eversant  formerly smartenergy services  inc of million after tax  or 
per share  related to eversant s inves tment in home service store  inc hss  offset by higher business development costs and a fourth quarter accrual for a potential income tax liability 
increased earnings versus resulted mainly from nonrecurring income related to the favorable millstone unit settlement and the favorable connecticut valley first circuit court of appeals decision amounting to million after tax  or 
per share  and million after tax  or 
per share  respectively  and higher utility revenues of million after tax  or 
per share  principally due to a ferc ordered refund of transmission costs from citizens utilities 
in addition  connecticut valley reversals of disallowed power costs previously accrued and expensed in  had a positive impact of million after tax  or 
per share  and lower net losses at eversant had a positive impact of million after tax  or 
per share 
lower operating costs of million after tax  or 
per share  resulted from lower service restoration costs and lower regulatory costs related to retail rates 
this was offset by the negative impact of million a fter tax  or 
per share  due to higher accruals in for the expected under recovery of power costs on the hydro quebec power contract compared to  higher net power costs of million after tax  or 
per share  primarily resulting from accrued installed capability icap deficiency charges and increased hydro quebec capacity costs 
in addition  lower earnings at catamount amounted to million after tax  or 
per share  mainly related to a write down of a portion of the gauley river equity investment  higher net losses from catamount s investment in thetford and catamount s share of costs incurred in connection with its investment in a wind farm project in germany

operating revenues and megawatt hour mwh sales a summary for   and follows mwh sales revenues s residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales resale sales firm entitlement alliance other total resale sales other revenues total effective january   power purchased from hydro quebec was recorded net of entitlement sales to hydro quebec  therefore  the entitlement sales have been restated for comparison purposes in the table above 
year to year fluctuations in total retail mwh sales are affected by economic conditions  weather patterns  and customer usage patterns  which are affected by the absolute cost of electricity and its costs relative to other fuel sources 
retail mwh sales for decreased  mwh  or  while related revenues increased million for compared to the june  approved rate order  which allowed for a increase in retail rates beginning in july   contributed approximately million and the favorable impact of customer mix and unit pricing contributed million  while the decrease in mwh sales resulted in a million decrease 
the decline in retail sales in can be attributed to both mild weather patterns and the slowing economy s impact on many of the company s industrial customers 
compared to  retail mwh sales for increased  mwh  or  and related revenues decreased million  or 
the revenue decrease was primarily attributable to the rate reduction for the funding of the state of vermont sponsored energy efficiency utility eeu 
for  entitlement mwh sales decreased when compared to  due in part to the discontinuance  in october  of a five year power contract in which the company sold approximately of its share of vermont yankee output at full cost 
additionally  in and  the company entered into short term unit swap transactions where it sold a small portion of its share of vermont yankee for an equal share of the output from other nuclear facilities in new england  the offsetting purchases are included in the purchased power and produced energy mwh table below 
in  the vermont yankee swap transactions of approximately million were included in other  while the swap transactions of approximately million in were included in entitlement  in the table above 
for  entitlement mwh sales increased when compared to the increase primarily resulted from vermont yankee short term unit swap transactions as described above 
in addition  included a vermont yankee refueling outage  while there was no refueling outage in other resale sales decreased  mwh  or  in compared to  primarily due to lower output and purchases from the company s power resources  which impacts the amount of energy available for resale 
those reductions included the vermont yankee and millstone unit refueling outages in  lower hydro quebec firm energy contract purchases due to phase out of the contract  and lower hydro production from the company s owned facilities and fewer hydro purchases due to low rainfall 
offsetting the decrease in other were vermont yankee unit swap transactions  which were included in other in and entitlement in other resale sales in decreased  mwh compared to and related revenues decreased million 
these variances reflected current market conditions in vermont and new england 
these sales made on a short term basis included sales to iso new england and other utilities in new england 
page of alliance resale sales in and resulted from activity by the company through its alliance with virginia power in jointly supplying wholesale power primarily in the northeast states 
in the third quarter of  the company and virginia power agreed to discontinue the alliance 
for  alliance resale sales decreased  mwh and related revenues decreased million compared to alliance related sales ended in december the million decrease in other revenues in compared to primarily resulted from nonrecurring income in with no comparable items in in  other revenues included nonrecurring income of million for the reversal of the provision for rate refunds due to a favorable first circuit court of appeals decision allowing connecticut valley to recover all of its power costs in rates and a million ferc ordered refund of transmission costs from citizens utilities 
compared to  other revenues in increased million partly due to the items explained above 
the table below summarizes the components of increases or decreases in revenues compared to the prior year dollars in thousands revenue increase decrease from retail mwh sales retail rates unit price changes in firm resale sales changes in entitlement sales change in alliance sales changes in other resale sales changes in other revenues net decrease over prior year purchased power the company purchases approximately of its power needs under several contracts of varying duration 
over of its purchases are from affiliated companies whereby the company receives its entitlement share of the output 
the company s purchased power portfolio assures that a diversified mix of sources and fuel types are available to meet the company s long term load growth while providing short and intermediate term opportunities to purchase or sell capacity and energy to reduce overall power costs 
a breakdown of the company s energy sources  including the unit swap transactions and excluding sources related to the alliance  is shown below sources of energy nuclear generating companies canadian imports company owned hydro jointly owned units independent power producers other sources the company maintains a joint ownership interest in unit of the millstone nuclear power station and owns a equity interest in connecticut yankee 
unit is currently operated by dominion nuclear connecticut dnc  a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc  and connecticut yankee is operated by northeast utilities nu 
the company maintains joint ownership interests in joseph c 
mcneil  a mw wood  gas and oil fired unit  and wyman  a mw oil fired unit  and also owns a and equity interest in maine yankee and yankee atomic  respectively 
the company owns a equity interest in vermont yankee  of which its ownership percentage changed to in the first quarter of related to the buy back of shares held by minority owners of the plant  which is explained in more detail below 
the company s entitlement percentage of vermont yankee is 
in addition  the company owns hydroelectric generating units with a total nameplate cap ability of mw and two gas fired and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
during scheduled nuclear refueling outages  the company purchases more costly replacement energy from other sources to satisfy energy needs 
in accordance with current ratemaking treatment  the company defers and amortizes to expense  over their respective fuel cycles  the incremental replacement energy and maintenance costs associated with refueling outages for vermont yankee and millstone unit during  the company deferred million for maintenance costs 
page of millstone unit on july   the company and the other non operating owners of unit reached a settlement with nu related to a demand for arbitration filed in for recovery of costs resulting from the shutdown of unit in in august  as a result of the settlement  the company received a cash settlement of million on september   nu announced its intent to auction its nuclear generating plants  including unit on august   the connecticut department of public utility control announced that dominion resources  inc was the successful bidder in the auction 
pursuant to the terms of the august settlement described above  the company participated as a potential seller in that auction  however  upon notification of the sales price  the company declined the purchase offer 
the sale to dnc became final on march  unit continues to be a jointly owned plant  and the company is one of two minority owners 
the total dnc share of unit is as part of the regulatory approvals of the sales to dnc by the joint owners of that plant  dnc has represented to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and other regulatory bodies  including the connecticut department of public utility control  that the millstone unit decommissioning trust fund  for its share of the plant  exceeds the nrc minimum calculation required and therefore no further contributions to the fund are required at this time 
the company has agreed with the dps position in its recent rate case that the dnc representation that contributions currently can cease is appropriate subject to periodic review of both the fund balance and the nrc minimum calculation upon which the dnc bases its assertion of fund adequacy 
the company could choose to renew funding at its own discretion as long as the minimum requirement is met or exceeded 
vermont yankee the vermont yankee nuclear power plant  which provides more than one third of the company s power supply  began a scheduled refueling outage on april   which ended on may   days shorter than budgeted 
the previous refueling outage began on october  and the plant returned to service december  the refueling outage march june extended days beyond the scheduled days 
the next scheduled refueling outage is october the vermont yankee plant currently has several fuel rods that will require repair during  a maintenance requirement that is not unique to vermont yankee 
there are various means of addressing the maintenance  including an estimated ten day shutdown of the plant  or a delay in shutdown accompanied by a reduction in the generation output at the plant 
at the present time  the company is unable to estimate when the maintenance will occur or its ultimate cost  but it could be material 
on october   the company and the other owners of vermont yankee accepted a bid for sale of the plant to amergen energy company amergen and on november   vermont yankee executed an asset purchase agreement with amergen 
on november   the owners of vermont yankee accepted and submitted to the psb an improved offer for the sale of the plant to amergen 
on february   the psb issued its order dismissing petition in docket no 
 the proceeding in which the company  along with gmp  vermont yankee and amergen sought psb approval of the sale of the vermont yankee nuclear plant to amergen 
in this order  the psb determined that the proposed purchase price  as filed in november  pursuant to a memorandum of understanding  did not reflect the fair market value of the plant and  therefore  the sale did not promote the general good of the state of vermont 
this ruling was consistent with the company s position 
the psb dismissed the petition for approval in march the management of vermont yankee subsequently concluded that selling the plant at auction would provide the greatest benefit to the owners and consumers 
the investment banking firm of jpmorgan was retained by vermont yankee as the exclusive financial advisor for the auction 
as a result of issues raised related to the cancelled amergen sale  vermont yankee reached an agreement in principle with the vermont yankee sponsors and their secondary power purchasers  the dps and the ferc staff that reduces the vermont yankee cost of service the sponsors and the secondary purchasers will expect to pay through the agreement is reflected in billings to sponsors and secondary purchasers effective july the ferc approved the agreement on september  on august   vermont yankee announced that a sales agreement had been reached with entergy corporation entergy for million  representing million for the plant and related assets and million for nuclear fuel 
entergy will also assume decommissioning liability for the plant and its decommissioning trust fund 
the agreement includes a purchase power contract with prices that generally range from cents to cents per kilowatt hour subject to a low market adjuster that protects the current vermont yankee owner utilities  page of including the company and its power consumers  in the event power market prices drop significantly 
on september   the company filed testimony with the psb in support of the sale 
in an order entered october   the psb granted intervention to several parties that the company did not oppose  and established a schedule that provides for discovery  hearings and final briefing by april  certain of the intervenors were secondary purchasers of vermont yankee power  which were seeking adjustments in their power purchase contracts  and stockholders of vermont yankee  which were asserting dissenters rights 
on january   vermont yankee announced that it had reached an agreement with the secondary purchasers and had purchased back the shares held by the minority stockholders  these parties have requested to withdraw from the psb proceeding 
on january   the dps and the remaining intervenors prefiled their direct testimony in the psb proceeding 
initial hearings occurred during the first week of february with prefiled rebuttal testimony due on february   and rebuttal hearings march through march  the current schedule in the psb proceeding could permit a closing  if the sale is approved  by the end of july the company cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings 
the sale is also subject to other regulatory approvals including the nuclear regulatory commission and the securities and exchange commission 
maine yankee on august   the maine yankee nuclear power plant was prematurely retired from commercial operation 
the company relied on maine yankee for less than of its required system capacity 
the decommissioning effort continues per project plans 
the total expected decommissioning costs for maine yankee are million in dollars 
the original decommissioning contractor  stone and webster  filed for bankruptcy and  in january  maine yankee and federal insurance agreed on a settlement of the pending litigation arising from contract performance when stone and webster went into bankruptcy 
a settlement payment of million has been deposited into the maine yankee decommissioning trust fund 
future payments for the closing  decommissioning and recovery of the remaining investment in maine yankee  including the insurance settlement are currently estimated to be approximately million  the company s share is expected to be approximately millio n to be paid over the period through on january   maine yankee and the active intervenors filed an offer of settlement with the ferc which the ferc has approved 
as a result  all issues raised in the ferc proceeding  including recovery of anticipated future payments for closing  decommissioning and recovery of the remaining investment in maine yankee  are resolved 
also resolved are the issues raised by the secondary purchasers  who purchased maine yankee power through agreements with the original owners  limiting the amounts they will pay for decommissioning the maine yankee plant and settling other points of contention affecting individual secondary purchasers 
connecticut yankee on december   the connecticut yankee nuclear power plant was prematurely retired from commercial operation 
the company relied on connecticut yankee for less than of its required system capacity 
connecticut yankee continues to decommission the site 
connecticut yankee reached a settlement with the ferc and the intervenors that allows for the cost recovery of the total expected decommissioning costs now estimated at million in january dollars  as well as other appropriate costs of service 
the settlement rates became effective september   following the ferc order of july  connecticut yankee is required to commence a new filing before the ferc no later than july  to review the status of decommissioning expenditures  the expected remaining decommissioning costs and their collections  and other appropriate issues 
future payments for the closing  decommissioning and recovery of the remaining investment in connecticut yankee are currently estimated to be approximately million  the company s share is expected to be approximately million to be paid over the period through yankee atomic in  the yankee atomic nuclear power plant was retired from commercial operation 
the company relied on yankee atomic for less than of its system capacity 
as of july  yankee atomic had collected from its sponsors sufficient funds  based on a current forecast  to complete the decommissioning effort and to recover all other ferc approved costs of service 
therefore  yankee atomic discontinued billings to its sponsors pending the need to increase or decrease the funds available for the completion of its financial obligations  including decommissioning 
such a change would require a ferc review and approval 
yankee atomic is successfully decommissioning the site as planned 
page of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic decommissioning costs currently  costs billed to the company by maine yankee and connecticut yankee  including a provision for ultimate decommissioning of the units  are being collected from the company s customers through existing retail and wholesale rate tariffs 
as of december   the company completed its obligation for decommissioning costs based on current estimates related to yankee atomic 
the company s share of remaining costs with respect to maine yankee and connecticut yankee s decisions to discontinue operation were estimated to be million and million  respectively  at december  these amounts are subject to ongoing review and revisions and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet both as regulatory assets and nuclear dismantling liabilities current and non current 
in the first quarter of  the company plans to revise its estimates related to maine yankee to reflect the impact of the insurance settlement described above 
the decision to prematurely retire these nuclear power plants was based on economic analyses of the costs of operating them compared to the costs of closing them and incurring replacement power costs over the remaining period of the plants operating licenses 
this would have the effect of lowering costs to customers 
the company believes that based on the current regulatory process  its proportionate share of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic decommissioning costs will be recovered through the regulatory process and  therefore  the ultimate resolution of the premature retirement of the three plants has not and should not have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings or financial condition 
cogeneration independent power qualifying facilities the company purchases power from a number of independent power producers ipps who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy using hydroelectric  biomass and refuse burning generation 
the majority of these purchases are made from a state appointed purchasing agent who purchases and redistributes the power to all vermont utilities 
under these long term contracts  in  the company received  mwh of which  mwh is associated with the vermont electric power producers and  mwh from a waste to energy electric generating facility owned by wheelabrator claremont company  lp the company expects to purchase approximately  mwh of independent power output in each year through based on the forecast level of production  the total commitment in the next five years to purchase power from these independent power facilities is estimated to be million  which excludes the impact of the january  memorandum of understanding described below 
on august   the company  gmp  citizens utilities and all of vermont s municipal utilities filed a petition with the psb requesting modification of the contracts between the ipps and the state appointed purchasing agent 
the petition outlined seven specific elements that  if implemented  would reduce purchase power costs and reform these contracts for the benefit of consumers 
on september   the psb opened a formal investigation in docket no 
regarding these contracts as requested by the petition 
shortly thereafter  citizens utilities  hardwick electric department and burlington electric department notified the psb that they were withdrawing from the petition but would participate in the case as non moving parties 
in a separate action before the chittenden county superior court brought by several ipp owners  gmp s full participation in this psb proceeding was enjoined and that injunction has since been appealed to and affirmed by the vermont supreme court 
the company  the other moving utilities and the dps requested that the psb issue an order requiring gmp s full participation in the psb proceeding 
the psb declined to rule on the request but retained authority to require gmp to provide specific information or to submit any other specific filing 
on november   the ipps filed dispositive motions in docket no 
 urging the psb to declare that it lacks jurisdiction to grant relief sought by the company s petition 
on january   the company and the other petitioning utilities filed responses to the ipps motions  supporting the psb s exercise of jurisdiction  as called under the petition 
the dps also made a filing in support of jurisdiction 
on june   the psb hearing officer issued a proposal for decision pfd on the psb s jurisdiction to consider the petition 
the pfd recommended that the psb find that it has jurisdiction to consider the relief sought under the petition but that the psb may be precluded from issuing orders reducing the lengths of a purchasing agent contract or requiring buy outs or buy downs 
docket participants filed comments on the pfd 
on september   the psb issued an order regarding jurisdiction in which it adopted the conclusions of the hearing officer s pf d and found that it has jurisdiction to consider five of the seven claims outlined in the original petition 
the ipps also filed a related proceeding in the washington county superior court contending that the psb rules pertaining to ipps  which the utilities have relied upon  in part  in their petition before the psb  contains a so called scrivener s error 
by motion filed in the superior court in september  the ipps sought summary judgement in this action 
on january   the washington county superior court dismissed the ipps action  which the ipps appealed to the vermont supreme court 
the ipps also asked the vermont supreme court to stay the page of proceeding before the psb pending the outcome of their appeal 
by order dated april   the vermont supreme court denied the ipps request for a stay 
on march   the ipps also filed a related complaint before the ferc  requesting that the ferc issue an order preventing the company and the other vermont utilities from employing ferc order no 
to require the ipps  either directly or indirectly  to reserve transmission service and pay transmission charges in connection with their power sales 
in principal part the ipps argue that such reservations and related charges are prohibited under the regulations adopted by the state of vermont to implement the public utilities regulatory policies act of on april   the company and other vermont utilities filed their response arguing that the ipp complaint should be dismissed on procedural grounds and opposing the ipps allegations on the merits 
by order dated may   the commission declined to grant the relief requested and instead found that the complaint was premature in light of the fact that the psb has yet to rule on the disputed issues in the pro ceeding open before it to consider the petition 
in september  the petitioners and the ipps agreed to enter into a settlement discussion and on september  filed a stipulation for stay requesting that further proceedings in the docket be stayed to provide the parties an opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations 
a similar motion was also filed with the vermont supreme court regarding the appeal on the so called scrivener s error case 
on october   the psb hearing officer issued an order granting the stipulation for stay and indicated that a status conference would be convened midway through the day period  which was due to expire january  a status conference on the parties settlement efforts was convened on november  after several extensions  on january   the petitioners and the ipps filed a memorandum of understanding with the psb which  if approved  establishes a comprehensive settlement to the issues in docket no 
the memorandum of understanding would provide power cost reductions nominally worth approximately million to million over ten years  the agreement of the ipps to support efforts before the vermont general assembly and the psb to authorize securitization and to negotiate for the buy out and buy down of the ipp contracts with the goal of achieving additional power cost savings  and a global resolution of various related issues 
at this time  proceedings are continuing in psb docket no 
to consider the memorandum of understanding 
a status conference on the matter was held in february a decision in this matter is expected in generating units the company owns and operates hydroelectric generating units  two gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
the company is currently in the process of relicensing or preparing to relicense eight separate hydroelectric projects under the federal power act 
these projects  some of which are grouped together under a single license  represent approximately mw  or about of the company s total hydroelectric nameplate capacity 
in the new licenses  the ferc is expected to impose conditions designed to address the impact of the projects on fish and other environmental concerns 
the company is unable to predict the specific impact of the imposition of such conditions  but capital expenditures and operating costs are expected to increase in the short term to meet these licensing obligations and net generation from these projects will decrease in future periods 
peterson dam the company has worked with environmental groups and the state of vermont since to develop a plan to relicense peterson dam  a mw hydroelectric station on the lamoille river 
the vermont natural resources council vnrc has proposed removal of the dam  a hydro generating unit that produces power to energize approximately  homes per year 
in august  talks broke down  and the vnrc called publicly for removal of the dam 
the company has initiated broader discussions with vnrc  trout unlimited  the vermont agency of natural resources and other parties  related to the economic  reliability and environmental issues that peterson s removal would create 
other in order to optimize its power mix for baseload  intermediate and peaking power  the company engages in purchases and sales with other electric utilities primarily in new england and with the iso new england hourly clearing market to take advantage of immediate pricing and other market conditions 
revenue from sale transactions is used to reduce purchased power costs 
purchases from iso new england are included in other page of sources in the sources of energy table above 
the company also engaged in marketing activities with virginia power  which jointly supplied wholesale power primarily in the northeast states  however  in the third quarter of  the company and virginia power agreed to discontinue the alliance and the remaining committed purchases under the alliance were fulfilled in these purchases are excluded from the sources of energy table above 
net purchased power and production fuel the net cost components of purchased power and production fuel costs  including alliance purchases  for the past three years were as follows dollars in thousands units amount units amount units amount purchased and produced capacity mw energy mwh total purchased power costs production fuel mwh total purchased power and production fuel costs less entitlement and other resale sales mwh net purchased power and production fuel costs effective january   power purchased from hydro quebec was recorded net of entitlement sales to hydro quebec  therefore  the purchased and produced energy and entitlement and other resale sales have been restated for comparison purposes in the table above 
for  purchased capacity costs decreased million compared to primarily related to the following favorable impact of million related to a second quarter reversal of a million power cost accrual in related to estimated icap deficiency charges to iso new england due to a december ferc order  which was reversed in  the june  rate order that eliminated future disallowances for the under recovery of hydro quebec power costs resulting in a million favorable impact from the reversal of the accrual for estimated under recovery of hydro quebec power costs in the second quarter of  with no accrual for the future under recovery of those costs in the third quarter of  and lower vermont yankee capacity costs of million including the million impact of a net deferral of refueling outage costs related to lower decommissioning costs beginning july   lower net interest costs and operational efficien cies at the plant 
energy costs are directly related to the variable prices of oil and nuclear fuel  but more importantly  to the proportion of the company s purchased energy that comes from each of these fuel sources 
purchased energy in decreased million compared to  primarily due to alliance related purchases of approximately million in  which are offset by a decrease in alliance resale sales 
excluding alliance related energy purchases  purchased energy for decreased million compared to due to a decrease in output by expensive ipp hydro units  decreased balancing purchases from iso new england  and a net deferral related to incremental costs of replacement power during nuclear refueling outages 
in  production fuel costs decreased million primarily due to lower output and costs related to the mcneil generating plant  which was operated at a higher capacity level in to support reliability  and lower output from the wyman generating station 
for  purchased capacity costs increased million compared to  resulting from the negative impact of net higher loss accruals of million in for expected under recovery of power costs on the hydro quebec power contract and accrued icap deficiency charges in iso new england of million due to a december ferc order which was on appeal 
in addition  costs related to the hydro quebec power contract increased by million 
the increased capacity costs were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower connecticut valley loss accruals related to disallowed power costs of million  lower vermont yankee capacity costs of million including the impact of refueling outage deferrals  lower decommissioning costs of million  which was primarily related to yankee atomic  and lower alliance related capacity costs of million 
energy purchases decreased by million for compared to  primarily from a million decrease in alliance purchases  which are offset by a decrease in alliance resale sales 
excluding the alliance  page of energy purchased decreased by million for  primarily from a  or million  decrease in the amount of mwh purchased offset by a  or million  increase in price 
in  production fuel costs increased million compared to primarily due to increased operation of the mcneil generating plant to support reliability due to an equipment failure in northern vermont  and increased fuel costs 
the company is responsible for paying its entitlement percentage of decommissioning costs for vermont yankee  connecticut yankee  maine yankee and yankee atomic  as well as its joint ownership percentage of decommissioning costs for millstone unit for additional information see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the staff of the securities and exchange commission has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry  including the company  regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement related to asset retirement obligations that includes decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
see discussion of recent accounting pronouncements below 
based on present commitments and contracts  the company expects that net purchased power and production fuel costs will be approximately million  million and million for the period through other operation expenses there was no significant variance related to other operation expenses for compared to the decrease of approximately million for versus resulted primarily from decreased regulatory commission costs related to retail rates as well as decreased conservation and load management costs in  primarily as a result of the eeu

rates and regulation the company recognizes that adequate and timely rate relief is necessary if it is to maintain its financial strength  particularly since vermont regulatory rules do not allow for changes in purchased power and fuel costs to be automatically passed on to consumers through rate adjustment clauses 
the company intends to continue its practice of periodically reviewing costs and requesting rate increases when warranted 
page of vermont retail rate proceedings retail rate case the company filed for a  or million per annum  general rate increase on september  to become effective june  to offset increasing costs of providing service 
approximately million  or  of the rate increase request was to recover scheduled contractual increases in the cost of power the company purchases from hydro quebec 
in response to the company s september rate increase filing  the psb decided to appoint an independent investigator to examine the company s decision to buy power from hydro quebec 
the company made a filing with the psb stating that the psb  as well as other parties  should be barred from reviewing past decisions because the psb already examined the company s decision to buy power from hydro quebec in a rate case in which the company was penalized for improvident power supply management 
during february  the dps filed testimony in opposition to the company s retail rate increase request 
the dps recommended that the psb instead reduce the company s then current retail rates by  or million 
the company sought  and the psb granted  permission to stay this rate case and to file an interlocutory appeal of the psb s denial of the company s motion to preclude a re examination of the company s hydro quebec contract in the company argued its pos ition before the vermont supreme court

on february   the vermont supreme court issued a decision on the company s rate case appeal that reversed the psb s decision on the preclusion issues and remanded the case to the psb for further proceedings consistent with the vermont supreme court s decision 
the company s june  rate order  which is described below  ended the uncertainty over the future recovery of hydro quebec contract costs  and the company will no longer incur future losses for under recovery of hydro quebec contract costs related to any allegations of imprudence prior to the june  rate order 
on may   the company and the dps reached a rate case settlement that would end uncertainty over the future recovery of hydro quebec contract costs  allow a rate increase  make the january  temporary rates permanent  permit a return on equity of for the twelve months ending june  for the vermont utility  and create new service quality standards 
the company also agreed to a second quarter million one time write off million after tax of regulatory assets and a rate freeze through january  on june   the psb issued an order on the company s rate case settlement with the dps 
in addition to the provisions outlined above  the approved rate order requires the company to return up to million to ratepayers in the event of a merger  acquisition or asset sale if such sale requires psb approval 
as a result of the rate order  the rate increase became effective with bills rendered july   and in june the company page of recorded a million after tax loss to write off certain regulatory assets as agreed to in the settlement 
the company was able to accept the rate increase versus the increase it requested since regulatory asset amortizations will decrease approximately million  on a twelve month basis  due to the million one time write off of regulatory assets and vermont yankee decommissioning costs decreased approximately million  on a twelve month basis  after the rate case was filed as a result of an agreement between vermont yankee and the secondary purchasers 
deseasonalized rates on june   the psb approved the company s request to end the winter summer rate differential and  therefore  the company now has flat rates throughout a given year

under these clauses  connecticut valley recovers its estimated annual costs for purchased energy and capacity  which are reconciled when actual data is available 
in the third quarter of  management determined that connecticut valley is again subject to cost based ratemaking and qualifies for the application of sfas no 
this decision was based on the favorable court of appeals decision of july  and the subsequent denial of the nhpuc s petition for writ of certiorari by the united states supreme court on february   as well as other regulatory developments in new hampshire during the application of sfas no 
resulted in an extraordinary charge of million for connecticut valley

proposed formation of holding company in order to further prepare the company for deregulation  and to insulate the company from the risks of its various regulated and unregulated subsidiaries  the company filed a petition with the psb in for permission to create a holding company that would have as subsidiaries the company and non utility subsidiaries  catamount and eversant and their subsidiaries 
the proposal had been revised to have connecticut valley become a direct subsidiary of the holding company  rather than remain as a subsidiary of the company 
the company believed that a holding company structure would reduce the company s vermont utility s cost of capital and thus would be beneficial to its ratepayers  and would also benefit any future transition to a deregulated electricity market in vermont 
the proposed holding company formation was subject to approval by federal regulators  including the securities and exchange commission  the ferc  various states and the company s shareholders 
the company had negotiated an agreement with the dps regarding code of conduct and affiliate transaction rules to be utilized once a holding company structure is implemented 
as part of the settlement in the june  rate order  the company and the dps agreed to develop and file a schedule for the consideration of the holding company structure for the company  and to submit an agreement supporting the approval of affiliate transaction rules and codes of conduct for a new holding company 
the psb approved the schedule for the holding company docket  which schedule anticipated a settlement filing  if any  in september and set forth a schedule for litigation  if necessary  beginning in december the company and the dps were unable to reach a resolution of issues  and the company filed a motion to dismiss its petition 
on september   the psb issued its order closing docket  without prejudice 
the company cannot predict whether it will request psb approval of a holding company structure in the future 
electric industry restructuring the electric utility industry is in a period of transition that may result in a shift away from ratemaking based on cost of service and return on equity to more market based rates with energy sold to customers by competing retail energy service providers 
many states  including vermont and new hampshire  where the company does business  are exploring new mechanisms to bring greater competition  customer choice and market influence to the industry while retaining the public benefits associated with the current regulatory system 
recent events  including those related to restructuring in california and uncertainties concerning the operations of the wholesale markets in new england  have resulted in a slowdown of the restructuring process in vermont 
page of vermont recently  there have been three primary sources of vermont governmental activity in attempting to restructure the electric industry in vermont the governor s working group  created by the governor of vermont  the psb s docket no 
through which the psb considered proposals to restructure committed utility power supply arrangements  and the psb s docket no 
 through which the psb considered the establishment of policies and procedures to govern retail competition within the company s service territory 
at this time  the psb has concluded its investigation into the restructuring of committed power supply arrangements in docket no 
 the proceeding has been closed and the company has actively pursued initiatives for such purposes 
additionally  in december  the psb issued an order closing docket no 
as a result  the company cannot determine when or if retail competition will be introduced within the company s vermont service territory 
new hampshire ferc proceedings on february   connecticut valley was directed by the nhpuc to terminate its purchase of power from the company 
the company filed an application with the ferc in june  to recover stranded costs in connection with its wholesale rate schedule with connecticut valley and the notice of cancellation of that rate schedule contingent upon the recovery of the stranded costs that would result from the cancellation of that rate schedule 
in december  the ferc rejected the company s proposal to recover stranded costs through the imposition of a surcharge in the company s transmission tariff  but indicated that it would consider an exit fee mechanism in the wholesale rate schedule for collecting stranded costs 
the ferc denied the company s motion for a rehearing regarding the transmission surcharge proposal 
however  the company filed a request with the ferc for an exit fee mechanism in the wholesale rate schedule to collect the stranded costs resulting from the cancellation of the wholesale rate schedule 
the stranded cost obligation sought to be recovered was million in nominal dollars and million on a net present value basis as of december  on april   a ferc administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision in the company s stranded cost exit fee proceeding 
the alj ruled that if connecticut valley terminates its relationship as a wholesale customer of the company and subsequently becomes a wholesale transmission customer of the company  connecticut valley shall be liable for payment of stranded costs to the company 
the alj calculated  on an illustrative pro forma basis  a nominal stranded cost obligation of nearly million through the amount of the exit fee as determined by the alj will decrease with each year that service continues and normal tariff revenues are collected  and will ultimately be calculated from the date of termination  if notice of termination is ever given 
absent termination of the wholesale rate schedule by mutual agreement  the earliest termination date that could presently occur pursuant to the wholesale rate schedule is december  the stranded c ost obligation as of december   expressed on a net present value basis set forth in the alj order  is approximately million 
the alj s initial decision is subject to review and approval by the ferc 
if the company is unable to obtain approval by the ferc  and if connecticut valley is forced to terminate its relationship as a wholesale customer of the company  it is possible that the company would be required to recognize a pre tax loss under this contract totaling approximately million as of december  the company would also be required to write off approximately million pre tax of regulatory assets associated with its wholesale business as of december  if the company obtains a ferc order authorizing the updated requested exit fee and notice of termination is given  connecticut valley will apply to the nhpuc to increase rates in order to pay the exit fee 
the company believes that the nhpuc must permit connecticut valley to raise rates to recover the cost of the exit fee 
however  if connecticut valley is unable to recover its costs in rates  connecticut valley w ould be required to recognize the loss discussed above 
in addition to its efforts before the court and ferc  connecticut valley has initiated efforts and will continue to work for a negotiated settlement with parties to the new hampshire restructuring proceeding and the nhpuc 
an adverse resolution of the ferc and new hampshire proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
however  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter

regional transmission organizations rto pursuant to ferc order no 
issued april the company operates its transmission system under an open access  nondiscriminatory transmission tariff 
page of on may   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend ferc s regulations under the federal power act to facilitate the formation of regional transmission organizations rto 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
 which requires all public utilities that own  operate  or control interstate electric transmission to file a proposal for an rto by october   or in the alternative  a description of any efforts by the utility to participate in an rto  the reasons for not participating and any obstacles to participation  and any plans for further work toward such participation 
the filing date for order no 
was extended to january  for utilities in regions with an existing independent system operator  such as iso new england 
the company  jointly with gmp  citizens utilities and vermont electric power company  filed its comments on the new england rto proposal submitted by some of the new england transmission owners and iso new england on january  on july   the ferc issued an order on the new england rto proposal  which found that the rto proposed by the new england market participants would be insufficient in its proposed scope and regional configuration to effectively perform an rto s required functions and to support competitive power markets 
the ferc required that the participants in the proceedings involving the three proposed rtos in the northeast  participate in mediation on forming a single northeastern rto 
the ferc directed an administrative law judge to mediate settlement discussions with the parties for a period of days and file a report within days due on september  
from july  through september   the company participated in joint mediation with approximately other northeast participants to develop an rto  which meets the requirements of order no 
the primary tasks of the mediation were focused on defining the northeastern rto s operational paradigm  developing an infrastructure and operating rules  and implementing the rto across the entire region 
as directed by the ferc  the administrative law judge assigned to the mediation filed a report of the mediation on september  at this time  the company is unsure as to the outcome of this matter or its potential affects on the company 
competition risk factors if retail competition is implemented in vermont or new hampshire  the company is unable to predict the impact on its revenues  the company s ability to retain existing customers with respect to their power supply purchases and attract new customers or the margins that will be realized on retail sales of electricity  if any such sales are sought 
the company expects its power distribution and transmission service to its customers to continue on an exclusive basis subject to continuing economic regulation 
historically  electric utility rates have been based on a utility s costs 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that are not applicable to other business enterprises in general 
sfas no 
requires regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company believes it currently complies with the provisions of sfas no 
for both its regulated vermont and new hampshire service territory and ferc regulated wholesale businesses 
in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations of approximately million on a pre tax basis as of december  criteria that give rise to the discontinuance of sfas no 
include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to establish prices to recover specific costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
sfas no 
 adopted by the company on january   requires that any assets  including regulatory assets  that are no longer probable of recovery through future revenues  be revalued based upon future cash flows 
sfas no 
requires that a rate regulated enterprise recognize an impairment loss for the amount of costs excluded from recovery 
as of december   based upon the regulatory environment within which the company currently operates  sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s regulated businesses 
competitive influences or regulatory developments may impact this status in the future 
because the company is unable to predict what form possible future restructuring legislation will take  it cannot predict if or to what extent sfas no 
and will continue to be applicable in the future 
see recent accounting pronouncements below for the new accounting standard related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas no 
effective january  if the company is unable to mitigate or otherwise page of recover stranded costs that could arise from any potentially adverse legislation or regulation  the company would have to assess the likelihood and magnitude of losses incurred under its power contract obligations 
as such  the company cannot predict whether any restructuring legislation enacted in vermont or new hampshire  once implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
however  the company s failure to recover a significant portion of its purchased power costs  would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  ability to obtain capital at competitive rates and ability to exist as a going concern 
it is possible that stranded cost exposure before mitigation could exceed the company s current total common stock equity 
inflation the annual rate of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  was for  for and for the company s revenues  however  are based on rate regulation that generally recognizes only historical costs 
inflation therefore continues to have an impact on most aspects of the business 
recent accounting pronouncements derivative instruments on january   the company adopted sfas no 
subsequently amended by sfas no 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company has one long term purchase power contract that allows the seller to purchase specified amounts of power with advance notice hydro quebec sellback
