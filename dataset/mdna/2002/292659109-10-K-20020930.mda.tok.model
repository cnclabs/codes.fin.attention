sovlux and sovlux battery closed stock company sovlux battery  and united solar and bekaert ecd solar systems formed a joint venture in belgium  nv bekaert ecd europe bekaert ecd europe owned by united solar and by bekaert ecd solar systems 
the company s investments in texaco ovonic battery systems  texaco ovonic fuel cell  texaco ovonic hydrogen systems  ovonyx and ovonic media are recorded at zero 
the company will continue to carry its investment in each of these joint ventures at zero until the venture becomes profitable based upon the venture s history of sustainable profits  at which time the company will start to recognize over a period of years its share  if any  of the then equity of each of the ventures  and will recognize its share of each venture s profits or losses on the equity method of accounting 
to the extent that the company has made cash or other capital contributions  it recognizes its proportionate share of any losses until the investment reaches zero 
the company has three joint ventures  rare earth ovonic  with rare earth high tech co 
ltd 
rare earth high tech of baotou steel company of inner mongolia  china  for the manufacturing of its battery and other related products and components 
the company accounts for its interest in each of these joint ventures using the cost method of accounting total cash investment of based upon the opinion of legal counsel  the company believes that it has no obligation to fund any losses that its joint ventures incur beyond the company s investment 
ecd and bekaert each have guaranteed of the rent obligation for bekaert ecd solar systems new auburn hills  michigan facility and of bekaert ecd solar systems  sale and leaseback of the mw machinery and equipment see note m commitments 
bekaert ecd solar systems united solar will require an estimated additional  through the period ending september  in order to cover operating expenses  including ramp up of production and implementation of marketing programs  and for working capital purposes 
neither ecd nor bekaert is obligated to provide any portion of the required additional funding to bekaert ecd solar systems united solar 
however  ecd and bekaert have agreed to make bridge loans to the joint ventures in the aggregate amount of  with  in bridge financing provided by bekaert and  by ecd

ecd may also provide additional bridge loans to the joint ventures see note m commitments 
product sales product sales include revenues related to machine building contracts and equipment sales  photovoltaic products  metal hydride materials and revenues related to building of battery packs 
revenues related to machine building contracts and sales related to other long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting using the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected costs 
all other product sales are recognized when the product is shipped 
these products are shipped fob shipping point 
currently  low sales volumes related to metal hydride materials combined with high fixed costs result in losses 
royalties most license agreements provide for the company to receive royalties from the sale of products which utilize the licensed technology 
typically  the royalties are incremental to and distinct from the license fee and are recognized as revenue upon the sale of the respective licensed product 
in several instances  the company has received cash payments for nonrefundable advance royalty payments which are creditable against future royalties under the licenses 
advance royalty payments are deferred and recognized in revenues as the creditable sales occur  the underlying agreement expires  or when the company has demonstrable evidence that no additional royalties will be creditable and  accordingly  the earnings process is completed 
in connection with a battery development contract contract with the united states advanced battery consortium usabc  partially funded by the us department of energy doe  we have agreed to reimburse usabc and doe  as their recoupment for payments to us under the contract  a share of royalty payments we receive through may  where ovonic tm nimh batteries serve as the primary source of power for electric vehicles recoupment 
we do not believe that royalties received to date for batteries manufactured by our licensees are subject to recoupment 
ecd has a royalty trust arrangement whereby ecd is obligated to pay a trust of optical memory royalties received 
in the year ended june   ecd paid  to this trust 
business agreements a substantial portion of revenues is derived through business agreements for the development and or commercialization of products based upon the company s proprietary technologies 
license agreement fees are generally recognized as revenue at the time the agreements are consummated  which is the completion of the earnings process 
typically  such fees are nonrefundable  do not obligate the company to incur any future costs or require future performance by the company  and are not related to future production or earnings of the licensee 
license fees payable in installments are recorded at the present value of the amounts to be received  taking into account the collectibility of the license fee 
in some instances  a portion of such license fees is contingent upon the commencement of production or other uncertainties 
in these cases  license fee revenues are not recognized until commencement of production or the resolution of uncertainties 
generally  there are no current or future direct costs associated with license fees 
revenues from product development agreements that contain specific performance criteria are recognized on a percentage of completion basis which matches the contract revenues to the costs incurred on a project based on the relationship of costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
revenues from product development agreements  where there are no specific performance terms  are recognized in amounts equal to the amounts expended on the programs 
generally  the agreed upon fees for product development agreements contemplate reimbursing the company for costs considered associated with project activities including expenses for direct product development and research  patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
accordingly  expenses related to product development agreements are recorded as cost of revenues from product development agreements
