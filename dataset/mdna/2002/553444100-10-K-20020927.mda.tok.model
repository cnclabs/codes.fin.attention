the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to the company s accounts receivable

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company records reserves for bad debts based on the age of the receivables and historical bad debt percentages

depreciation on the company s property and equipment has been computed based on the following useful lives years buildings and improvements to motor vehicles and transportation equipment to machinery and equipment to furniture and fixtures to long lived  intangible assets and goodwill 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
