overview durect corporation is pioneering the treatment of chronic diseases and conditions by developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems to deliver the right drug to the right place in the right amount at the right time 
these capabilities can enable new drug therapies or optimize existing ones based on a broad range of compounds  including small molecule pharmaceuticals as well as biotechnology molecules such as proteins  peptides and genes 
we focus on the treatment of chronic diseases including pain  cns disorders  cardiovascular disease and cancer 
our lead product in development is the chronogesic pain therapy system previously known as duros sufentanil 
this product is a month continuous infusion subcutaneous implant for the treatment of chronic pain  and is based on the duros implant technology for which we hold an exclusive license from alza corporation to develop and commercialize products in selected fields 
we successfully completed a phase ii clinical trial for the chronogesic product in june we also concluded a pilot phase iii clinical trial and a pharmacokinetic trial in  and we completed the construction of a pilot manufacturing facility that will be used to manufacture the chronogesic product for our phase iii clinical trials and to meet initial demand for our product if it is approved by the fda for commercialization 
we anticipate that we will commence pivotal phase iii clinical trials for the chronogesic product in mid we also continue to develop or acquire other complementary technologies that we believe will be useful for us to develop products for the chronic disease areas we are targeting 
in the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of southern biosystems  inc sbs 
sbs conducts research and development of pharmaceutical products with us and with third party pharmaceutical and biotechnology company partners  and through its wholly owned subsidiary  birmingham polymers  inc  also develops and manufactures biodegradable polymers for third party pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in their products 
with this acquisition  we have added three additional proprietary drug delivery platforms  the saber delivery system  the microdur biodegradable microparticulate system  and the durin biodegradable implants 
in addition to this acquisition  we continued to research and develop other potential products based on the duros system throughout we currently generate revenue from the sale of alzet osmotic pumps for research animal use  intraear catheters  which have been used by physicians to treat inner ear disorders  and biodegradable polymers  which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products 
to a lesser extent  we also perform contract research and development services for certain partners 
however  because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines or contract research and development services 
since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses attributable to common stockholders were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december    and respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our products and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we also incurred a one time non cash charge of million for acquired in process research and development in in connection with the acquisition of sbs 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we expand clinical trial and research and development activities 
to support our research and development activities and the additional obligations of a public company  we expect to increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we also expect to incur substantial non cash expenses relating to stock based compensation 
we do not anticipate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least several years 
therefore  we expect to incur significant losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future 
acquisition of southern biosystems  inc in april  we acquired sbs  a privately held alabama corporation  which conducts research and development of pharmaceutical products with us and with third party pharmaceutical and biotechnology company partners  and through its wholly owned subsidiary  birmingham polymers  inc  also develops and manufactures biodegradable polymers for third party pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in their products 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued a total of  shares of common stock to former sbs shareholders  as well as reserved  shares for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding sbs options and warrants 
the total purchase consideration was million 
we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed  including million in debt  based upon their respective fair values 
in addition  we allocated the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets to specific intangible assets and goodwill 
we also recorded a one time  non cash charge to operations in the second quarter of of million for acquired in process research and development 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
we recorded  of unearned compensation related to the intrinsic value of approximately  unvested employee options assumed in connection with the acquisition 
this amount will be expensed to stock compensation ratably over the vesting period 
direct transaction costs related to the acquisition were approximately  sbs  and its wholly owned subsidiary birmingham polymers  inc  operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of durect  and our financial statements include the results of operations of sbs subsequent to the acquisition date 
we do not anticipate that sbs revenues from current product and service offerings will increase significantly in the future 
however  we intend to research and develop products that utilize the technologies acquired from sbs 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists and the collectability of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
incorrect assumptions at the time of sale about our customers ability to pay could result in an overstatement of revenue 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees thereon 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost 
all contracts have a ceiling price or contract value  and losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the losses become known and estimable 
incorrect estimates could result in greater or lesser losses being recorded 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technology are amortized to expense over time  while acquired in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
acquired in process research and development was million for compared to none in this charge resulted from the acquisition of sbs in april and represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which had not yet reached technological feasibility  and which had no alternative future use 
actions and comments from the securities and exchange commission have indicated that they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of purchased in process technology relating to acquisitions 
the commission is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the value of an acquisition than is appropriate 
we believe that we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance  as they currently exist 
however  the commission may seek to reduce the amount of purchased in process technology previously expensed by us 
this could result in the restatement of previously filed financial statements of durect and could have a material adverse impact on the financial results for the periods subsequent to the acquisition 
as of january   goodwill will not be amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment see recent accounting pronouncements 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows we expect to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful life of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill or enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill or enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective 
as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
we had recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the initial review or other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for clinical trial  engineering  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on managements estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
net revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in revenue compared to the corresponding period in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of sbs in april and its related revenues from polymer sales and contract research and development  and to our selling the alzet minipump product line throughout the entire year in  our revenues primarily resulted from sales of alzet products subsequent to the acquisition of the alzet product line in april  with the remainder from our ear catheter products 
in fiscal and  one customer accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
in the near future  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines or services 
as a result  we do not anticipate that our revenues from them will increase significantly 
gross profit 
gross profit was million or of revenues in compared to million or of revenues in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is attributable to manufacturing efficiencies related to our alzet product line  partially offset by the introduction of higher costs from sales of polymers and contract research and development which commenced following our acquisition of sbs 
cost of goods sold includes variances from expected costs that occur during the manufacturing processes for the alzet and sbs product lines  which may be large relative to our sales 
as a result  we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues related to these products to fluctuate 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to increases in research and development personnel and related expenses  including activities related to phase ii and pilot phase iii clinical trials for our lead product  chronogesic 
as of december   we had research and development employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect research and development expenses to increase as we begin pivotal phase iii clinical trials for chronogesic  continue to hire research and development personnel  and continue to research and develop other products  including those utilizing both duros and sbs delivery technologies 
in addition  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in order to meet minimum product funding requirements under our license agreement with alza 
to maintain our rights under this agreement  we must spend minimum amounts each year on product development  with the amount and duration of funding in each field varying over time 
for two of our duros based products currently in development  we are required to fund each in the amount of at least million per year until the time of commercialization 
through december   we achieved our minimum annual product development funding requirements 
the future minimum annual product funding requirements for all fields of use are as follows in thousands year ended december  total minimum funding required funding requirements after are to be mutually agreed upon by alza and us 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel and related expenses necessary to support our growth 
as of december   we had selling  general and administrative personnel compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we increase the number of personnel and related resources required to support our growth 
amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisitions of intraear  inc  the alzet product line and sbs  we acquired goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
goodwill is amortized over estimated useful lives of between and years  other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million for from  in the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in resulted primarily from intangibles amortization related to our acquisition of sbs in april combined with a full year of intangibles amortization related to our acquisition of the alzet product line in april the remaining goodwill and assembled workforce for these three acquisitions at december  was million and  respectively 
in subsequent periods  goodwill and assembled workforce will not be amortized  but will be periodically evaluated for impairment or obsolescence in accordance with sfas if it is determined that the assets are impaired  any excess of the carrying values over the estimated fair values will be written off as impairment changes to the related intangible assets 
the remaining other intangible assets for these three acquisitions at december  were million  which will be amortized as follows million for each of the years and  million for each of the years and  and  for the year we periodically evaluate acquired other intangible assets for impairment or obsolescence 
should the other intangible assets become impaired  we may amortize them on an accelerated schedule or write them down to their estimated fair value 
stock based compensation 
since inception  we have recorded aggregate deferred compensation charges of million in connection with stock options granted to employees and directors  including  that we recorded at the time of our acquisition of sbs in april for the assumption of outstanding unvested stock options granted to employees and directors of that company 
of the total amount  we have amortized million through december  in  we recorded million of stock based compensation  compared with million for of these amounts  employee stock compensation related to the following cost of goods sold of  for and  for  research and development expenses of million in  and million in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  million in and million in non employee stock compensation related to research and development expenses was  in and  in non employee stock compensation related to selling  general and administrative expenses was  in and  in expenses for non employee stock options are recorded over the vesting period of the options  with the amount determined by the black scholes option valuation method and remeasured over the vesting term 
the remaining employee deferred stock compensation at december  was million  which will be amortized as follows million for   for   for   for  and  for termination of employment of option holders could cause stock based compensation in future years to be less than indicated 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development was million for compared to none in this charge resulted from the acquisition of sbs in april and represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which had not yet reached technological feasibility  and which had no alternative future use 
actions and comments from the securities and exchange commission have indicated that they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of purchased in process technology relating to acquisitions 
the commission is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the value of an acquisition than is appropriate 
we believe that we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance  as they currently exist 
however  the commission may seek to reduce the amount of purchased in process technology previously expensed by us 
this could result in the restatement of previously filed financial statements of durect and could have a material adverse impact on the financial results for the periods subsequent to the acquisition 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding balances of cash and investments resulting from our initial public offering in september we expect interest income to decline as our average outstanding balances of cash and investments decline 
interest income will also decrease should yields on our investments decline with interest rates in general 
interest expense increased to  for from  for the corresponding period in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in debt obligations from the assumption of million of debt as part of our acquisition of sbs  and due to the structure of the payment schedule on our equipment loan 
we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal as we recognize a full year of interest payments on the debt assumed from sbs 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credits of approximately  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
net revenues were million in compared to  in we initiated sales in october following the acquisition of intraear  inc and its ear catheter products 
in the year  following the acquisition of the alzet product line in april of that year  our revenues primarily resulted from sales of alzet minipumps  with the remainder from our ear catheter products 
gross profit 
gross profit was million or of revenues in compared to  or of revenues in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is attributable to higher proportions of sales of the relatively higher cost alzet minipumps 
furthermore  cost of goods sold includes manufacturing cost variances that result from the completion of batches of the alzet product  which were large relative to our sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to increases in research and development personnel and related expenses  contract research and development services  and activity related to the preparation for our phase ii clinical trial relating to chronogesic  including the manufacturing of product to be used in the trial 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel and related expenses necessary to support our growth 
in particular  selling expenses increased following the acquisition of the alzet product line in april amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisitions of intraear  inc and the alzet product line  we acquired goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
amortization of intangible assets increased to  in  from  in amortization of intangibles assets in resulted from the acquisition of intraear  inc in october the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in resulted from the acquisition of the alzet product line in april and the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the intraear acquisition over the entire year 
stock based compensation 
for  we recorded million of stock based compensation  compared with  for the year ending december  of these amounts  employee stock compensation related to the following cost of goods sold of  for the year ended december   and for the year ending december   research and development expenses of million in  and  in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of million in and  in non employee stock compensation related to research and development expenses was  in and in non employee stock compensation related to selling  general and administrative expenses was  in and in expenses for non employee stock options are recorded over the vesting period of the options  with the amounts determined by the black scholes option valuation model and remeasured over the vesting term 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million in  from  in the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding balances of cash and investments resulting from the sale of convertible preferred stock in march and our initial public offering in september interest expense was  in  and  in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased debt obligations from equipment financings 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million at december  compared to million and million at december   and  respectively 
this also includes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted investments on our balance sheet  which serve as collateral for letters of credit securing a leased facility and sbs bonds payments 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments in compared to was primarily the result of increased operating and capital expenditures 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in compared to was primarily the result of the sale of stock in our initial public offering in  from which we raised million  net of issuance costs 
from inception through the time of our initial public offering  we raised million  net of issuance costs  through convertible preferred stock financings 
working capital was million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily attributable to expenditures related to our research and development efforts in general  the construction of our new manufacturing facility  and to purchases of certain long term investments 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and the sale of series c convertible preferred stock  partially offset by our operating loss of million and an increase in accrued and other current liabilities of million 
we used million  million  and million of cash for operations in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased net loss  offset by a non cash charge of million for acquired in process research and development 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased net loss and the acquisition of alzet inventory  offset by increased non cash charges related to stock awards  depreciation and amortization 
we used million  million  and million of cash in investing activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was due to lower net purchases of investments offset by an increase in capital expenditures incurred to construct our new manufacturing facility 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily due to purchases of short term investments  intangible assets related to the alzet product  and capital equipment 
we received  million  and million of cash from financing activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  cash received from financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments on equipment loans 
cash received from financing activities in was primarily the result of our initial public offering  and in  from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
we anticipate that cash used in operating and investing activities will increase significantly in the future as we research  develop  and manufacture our products  service our debt obligations and  as discussed above  meet our product funding requirements under our agreement with alza 
in aggregate  we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt capital leases and equipment loans operating lease obligations minimum product funding requirements to maintain rights to certain products under our agreement with alza total contractual cash obligations funding requirements after are to be mutually agreed upon by alza and us 
we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of at least million over the next months to purchase research and development and other capital equipment and to finalize the qualification and validation of our new manufacturing facility 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our products 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments  and planned capital expenditures through at least months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems currently under development for at least the next several years 
accordingly  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  and public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
we have not utilized and do not intend to utilize off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  hedging and derivative strategies  or other complex financial techniques to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by fasb statements nos 
and  which became effective on january  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our operating results or financial position since we currently do not invest in derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas establishes new standards for accounting and reporting for business combinations and will require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method will be prohibited 
we expect to adopt this statement during the first quarter of fiscal and we do not believe that sfas will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas establishes new standards for goodwill  including the elimination of goodwill and assembled workforce amortization to be replaced with methods of periodically evaluating intangibles for impairment 
in  sfas will become effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
we recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the initial review will be completed during the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that at the time the initial review or other periodic reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas provides a single model for accounting and reporting the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the statement also sets new criteria for the classification of assets held for sale and changes the reporting of discontinued operations 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form on k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we have not completed development of any of our pharmaceutical systems  and we cannot be certain that our pharmaceutical systems will be able to be commercialized to be profitable  we must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our pharmaceutical systems under development 
for each pharmaceutical system that we intend to commercialize  we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones for each disease or medical condition that we target  including selecting and developing drug delivery platform technology to deliver the proper dose of drug over the desired period of time  selecting and developing catheter technology  if appropriate  to deliver the drug to a specific location within the body  determining the appropriate drug dosage for use in the pharmaceutical system  developing drug compound formulations that will be tolerated  safe and effective and that will be compatible with the system  and demonstrating the drug formulation will be stable for commercially reasonable time periods 
the time frame necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product is long and uncertain  and we may not successfully complete these milestones for any of our products in development 
we have not yet completed development of any pharmaceutical systems  and durect has limited experience in developing such products 
we have selected the drug dosages and have substantially completed the product design of our lead product  chronogesic 
we have not  however  selected the drug dosages nor finalized the product design of any other pharmaceutical system  and we may not be able to complete the design of any additional products 
we are continuing testing and development of our products and exploring possible design changes to address issues of safety  manufacturing efficiency and performance 
we may not be able to complete development of any products that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period 
if we are unable to complete development of our chronogesic or other products  we will not be able to earn revenue from them  which would materially harm our business 
we must conduct and satisfactorily complete clinical trials for our pharmaceutical systems before we can obtain government approval to sell any of our pharmaceutical systems  we must demonstrate through preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials that each system is safe and effective for human use for each targeted disease 
as of december   we have completed an initial phase i clinical trial using an external pump to test the safety of continuous chronic infusion of sufentanil  a phase ii clinical trial  a pilot phase iii clinical trial and a pharmacokinetic trial for our lead product  chronogesic 
we are currently in the pre clinical or research stages with respect to all our other products under development 
we plan to continue extensive and costly clinical trials to assess the safety and effectiveness of our chronogesic product  including conducting pivotal phase iii trials necessary to support regulatory approval of the product in the united states and other countries of the world 
in addition  we plan to conduct extensive and costly clinical trials for our other potential products 
we may not be permitted to begin or continue our planned clinical trials for our potential products or  if our trials are permitted  our potential products may not prove to be safe or produce their intended effects 
in addition  we may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products  including chronogesic  which could delay commercialization of such products 
we anticipate that we will commence our pivotal phase iii trial of our intended first product  chronogesic  in mid which we expect will include at least  patients 
the length of our clinical trials will depend upon  among other factors  the rate of trial site and patient enrollment and the number of patients required to be enrolled in such studies 
we may fail to obtain adequate levels of patient enrollment in our clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  delays or termination of clinical trials  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  even if we enroll the number of patients we expect in the time frame we expect  our clinical trials may not provide the data necessary for their successful completion 
additionally  we may fail to effectively oversee and monitor these clinical trials  which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials 
even if these clinical trials are completed  we may fail to complete and submit a new drug application as scheduled 
even if we are able to submit a new drug application as scheduled  the food and drug administration may not clear our application in a timely manner or may deny the application entirely 
data already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our pharmaceutical systems do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later preclinical studies and clinical trials 
moreover  preclinical and clinical data such as ours is susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential product  resulting in delays to the commercialization of our products  and could materially harm our business 
our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our products  and thus our products may not be approved for marketing 
failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could delay or limit introduction of our new products and result in failure to achieve anticipated revenues the manufacture and marketing of our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the united states and abroad 
we must obtain clearance or approval from applicable regulatory authorities before we can market or sell our products in the u 
s or abroad 
before receiving clearance to market a product in the us or in any other country  we will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory agencies that the product is safe and effective on the patient population and for the diseases that will be treated 
clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of products are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the fda and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal  state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing  manufacture  labeling  advertising  distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
furthermore  these laws and regulations may be subject to varying interpretations  and we may not be able to predict how an applicable regulatory body or agency may choose to interpret or apply any law or regulation 
as a result  clinical trials and regulatory approval can take a number of years to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we may encounter delays or rejections based upon administrative action or interpretations of current rules and regulations 
we may also encounter delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation  administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
we may encounter similar delays in foreign countries 
sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory approvals that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be shorter or longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain requisite approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  and even if obtained  such approvals may not be on a timely basis  or they may not cover the clinical uses that we specify 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products  we will not be able to market and sell our products  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
in addition  data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearances 
as of december   we have completed an initial phase i clinical trial using an external pump to test the safety of continuous chronic infusion of sufentanil  a phase ii clinical trial  a pilot phase iii trial and a pharmacokinetic trial for our chronogesic product  but have not begun our pivotal phase iii trial of this product  or initiated clinical trials for any other products 
marketing or promoting a drug is subject to very strict controls 
furthermore  clearance may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the manufacture and marketing of drugs are subject to continuing fda and foreign regulatory review and requirements that we update our regulatory filings 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  or our failure to update regulatory files  may result in restrictions  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
any of the following events  if they were to occur  could delay or preclude us from further developing  marketing or realizing full commercial use of our products  which in turn would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals  failure to obtain approvals for clinically intended uses of our products under development  or identification of serious and unanticipated adverse side effects in our products under development 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations is difficult and costly 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed before they can be used for the commercial manufacture of our products 
we or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we have not been subject to a good manufacturing regulation inspection by the fda relating to our pharmaceutical systems 
if we do not achieve compliance for the products we manufacture  the fda may withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall  which may cause interruptions or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to support our clinical and commercial requirements at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience we must manufacture our products in clinical and commercial quantities  either directly or through third parties  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
the manufacture of our duros based pharmaceutical systems is a complex process 
although we have substantially completed development of the manufacturing process for our chronogesic product  we continue to consider ways to optimize our manufacturing process and to explore possible changes to increase efficiencies and lower costs 
we have not yet completed development of the manufacturing process for any products other than chronogesic 
if we fail to develop manufacturing processes to permit us to manufacture a product at an acceptable cost  then we may not be able to commercialize that product 
we completed construction of a manufacturing facility for our duros based pharmaceutical systems in may in accordance with our initial plans  and we anticipate that this facility  once it is ready for production  will be capable of manufacturing supplies for our phase iii clinical trial and commercial launch of our chronogesic product and for clinical trials of our spinal opiate product as well as other products on a pilot scale 
however  our facility and our production processes must be validated and qualified before we commence production of clinical and anticipated commercial supplies of our products 
we have substantially completed validating and qualifying our manufacturing facility but have not completed these processes 
durect has limited experience validating and qualifying manufacturing facilities 
in order to manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of our pharmaceutical systems  we must attain and maintain compliance with applicable federal  state and foreign regulatory standards relating to manufacture of pharmaceutical products which are rigorous  complex and subject to varying interpretations 
furthermore  our new facility will be subject to government audits to determine compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations  and we may be unable to pass inspection with the applicable regulatory agencies or may be asked to undertake corrective measures which may be costly and cause delay 
if we are unable to ready our manufacturing facility for production and manufacture product in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost and attain and maintain compliance with applicable regulations  we could experience a delay in our clinical trials and the commercial sale of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
additionally  we may need to alter our facility design or manufacturing processes  install additional equipment or do additional construction or testing in order to meet regulatory requirements  optimize the production process  increase efficiencies or production capacity or for other reasons  which may result in additional cost to us or delay production of product needed for our clinical trials and commercial launch 
we may also be required or choose to subcontract with third party contractors to perform the final manufacturing steps of our duros based pharmaceutical systems in which case we will be subject to the schedule  expertise and performance of third parties as well as incur significant additional costs 
see we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our products 
under our development and commercialization agreement with alza  we cannot subcontract the manufacture of subassemblies of the duros system without approval from alza 
if we cannot manufacture product in time to meet our clinical or commercial requirements or at an acceptable cost  our operating results will be harmed 
in april  we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza 
we manufacture subassemblies of the alzet product at our vacaville facility 
we currently rely on alza to perform the coating process for the manufacture of the alzet product  but we will be required to perform this process ourselves starting april or sooner 
we have limited experience manufacturing this product  and we may not be able to successfully or consistently manufacture this product at an acceptable cost  if at all 
our agreement with alza limits our fields of operation for our duros based pharmaceutical systems  requires us to spend significant funds on product development and gives alza a first right to distribute selected products for us in april  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with alza corporation  which was amended and restated in april and april alza was acquired by johnson johnson in june and has since operated as a wholly owned subsidiary 
our agreement with alza gives us exclusive rights to develop  commercialize and manufacture products using alza s duros technology to deliver by catheter drugs to the central nervous system to treat select nervous system disorders  drugs to the middle and inner ear  drugs to the pericardial sac of the heart  and select drugs into vascular grafts 
we also have the right to use the duros technology to deliver systemically and by catheter sufentanil to treat chronic pain  and select cancer antigens 
we may not develop  manufacture or commercialize duros based pharmaceutical systems outside of these specific fields without alza s prior approval 
in addition  if we develop or commercialize any drug delivery technology for use in a manner similar to the duros technology in a field covered in our license agreement with alza  then we may lose our exclusive rights to use the duros technology in such field as well as the right to develop new products using duros technology in such field 
furthermore  to maintain our rights under this license agreement  we must meet annual minimum development spending requirements totaling million to develop products in some or all of these fields through and fund development of a minimum number of products per year up to a total of eight products through in order to maintain commercialization rights for our products in the us and any foreign countries  we must diligently develop our products  procure required regulatory approvals and commercialize the products in these countries 
if we fail to meet the various diligence requirements  we may lose our rights to develop  commercialize and manufacture some of our duros based pharmaceutical systems  lose rights for products in some or all countries  including the us  or lose rights in some fields of use 
these rights would revert to alza  which could then develop duros based pharmaceutical products in such countries or fields of use itself or license others to do so 
in addition  in the event that our rights terminate with respect to any product or country  or this agreement terminates or expires in its entirety except for termination by us due to a breach by alza  alza will have the exclusive right to use all of our data  rights and information relating to the products developed under the agreement as necessary for alza to commercialize these products  subject to the payment of a royalty to us based on the net sales of the products by alza 
our agreement with alza gives us the right to perform development work and manufacture the duros pump component of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
in the event of a change in our corporate control  including an acquisition of us  our right to manufacture and perform development work on the duros pump would terminate and alza would have the right to manufacture and develop duros systems for us so long as alza can meet our specification and supply requirements following such change in control 
under the alza agreement  we must pay alza royalties on sales of duros based pharmaceutical systems we commercialize and a percentage of any up front license fees  milestone or special fees  payments or other consideration we receive  excluding research and development funding 
in addition  commencing upon the commercial sale of a product developed under the agreement  we are obligated to make minimum product payments to alza on a quarterly basis based on our good faith projections of our net product sales of the product 
these minimum payments will be fully credited against the product royalty payments we must pay to alza 
alza also has an exclusive option to distribute any duros based pharmaceutical system we develop to deliver non proprietary cancer antigens worldwide 
the terms of any distribution arrangement have not been set and are to be negotiated in good faith between alza and ourselves 
alza s option to acquire distribution rights limits our ability to negotiate with other distributors for these products and may result in lower payments to us than if these rights were subject to competitive negotiations 
we must allow alza an opportunity to negotiate in good faith for commercialization rights to our products developed under the agreement prior to granting these rights to a third party 
these rights do not apply to products that are subject to alza s option or products for which we have obtained funding or access to a proprietary drug from a third party to whom we have granted commercialization rights prior to the commencement of human clinical trials 
alza has the right to terminate the agreement in the event that we breach a material obligation under the agreement and do not cure the breach in a timely manner 
in addition  alza has the right to terminate the agreement if  at any time prior to july  we solicit for employment or hire  without alza s consent  a person who is or within the previous days has been an employee of alza  or if at any time prior to july  we solicit for employment or hire  without alza s consent  a person who is or within the previous days has been an employee of alza in the duros technology group 
we may be required to obtain rights to certain drugs some of the pharmaceutical systems that we are currently developing require the use of proprietary drugs to which we do not have commercial rights 
for example  our research collaboration with the university of maastricht has demonstrated that the use of a proprietary angiogenic factor in a pharmaceutical system can lead to elevated local concentration of the angiogenic factor in the pericardial sac of the heart  resulting in physical changes  including the growth of new blood vessels 
we do not currently have a license to develop or commercialize a product containing such proprietary angiogenic factor 
to complete the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical systems containing drugs to which we do not have commercial rights  we will be required to obtain rights to those drugs 
we may not be able to do this at an acceptable cost  if at all 
if we are not able to obtain required rights to commercialize certain drugs  we may not be able to complete the development of pharmaceutical systems intended to use those drugs 
this could result in the cessation of certain development projects and the potential write off of certain assets 
technologies and businesses which we have acquired may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we may also acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future  which could have these same effects we may acquire technologies  products or businesses to broaden the scope of our existing and planned product lines and technologies 
for example  in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of intraear  inc  in april we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza and in april  we completed the acquisition of sbs 
these and our future acquisitions expose us to increased costs associated with the acquisition and operation of the new businesses or technologies and the management of geographically dispersed operations  the risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies  operations  sites and personnel  the diversion of resources from our existing business and technologies  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated acquisition costs  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls  and procedures  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
acquisitions may also result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence or assumption of debt or additional expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets or potential businesses 
past acquisitions  such as our acquisitions of intraear  alzet and sbs  as well future acquisitions  may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
some of our products contain controlled substances  the making  use  sale  importation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state  federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies some of our products currently under development contain  and our products in the future may contain  controlled substances which are subject to state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution 
our chronogesic and spinal opiate products under development contain opioids which are classified as schedule ii controlled substances under the regulations of the us drug enforcement agency 
for our products containing controlled substances  we and our suppliers  manufacturers  contractors  customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state  federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution of controlled substances 
these regulations are extensive and include regulations governing manufacturing  labeling  packaging  testing  dispensing  production and procurement quotas  record keeping  reporting  handling  shipment and disposal 
failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our products containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action 
in addition  because of their restrictive nature  these regulations could limit our commercialization of our products containing controlled substances 
our limited operating history makes evaluating our stock difficult investors can only evaluate our business based on a limited operating history 
we were incorporated in february and have engaged primarily in research and development  licensing technology  raising capital and recruiting scientific and management personnel 
this short history may not be adequate to enable investors to fully assess our ability to successfully develop our products  achieve market acceptance of our products and respond to competition 
furthermore  we anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as pharmaceuticals  drug delivery  and biotechnology 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our products  which may not occur 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
we may require additional funds to complete the development of our products and to fund operating losses to be incurred in the next several years 
acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will delay our ability to generate or grow revenues our future financial performance will depend upon the successful introduction and customer acceptance of our future products  including our chronogesic product 
even if approved for marketing  our products may not achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  including oral medication  transdermal drug delivery products such as drug patches  or external or implantable drug delivery products  and pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  commercialize and market our future products when planned and achieve market acceptance  we will not achieve anticipated revenues 
if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or if new restrictive legislation is adopted  market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve anticipated revenues the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability  and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  recent federal and state government initiatives have been directed at lowering the total cost of health care  and the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained by governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly limiting payments or reimbursement for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may limit reimbursement or payment for our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably 
we have a history of operating losses  expect to continue to have losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing costs for research and development  clinical trials and manufacturing 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our proposed products  obtain the required regulatory clearances and manufacture and market our proposed products 
development of pharmaceutical systems is costly and requires significant investment 
in addition  we may choose to license either additional drug delivery platform technology or rights to particular drugs for use in our pharmaceutical systems 
the license fees for these technologies or rights would increase the costs of our pharmaceutical systems 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the commercial sale of our products and do not expect to receive significant revenue in the near future 
all revenues to date are from the sale of products we acquired in october in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of intraear  inc  the alzet product we acquired in april from alza and the sale of biodegradable polymers and contract research and development revenues from our sbs subsidiary 
we do not expect these revenues to increase significantly in future periods 
we do not anticipate commercialization and marketing of our products in development in the near future  and therefore do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses or achieve profitability in the near future 
we do not control alza s ability to develop and commercialize duros technology outside of fields licensed to us  and problems encountered by alza could result in negative publicity  loss of sales and delays in market acceptance of our duros based pharmaceutical systems alza retains complete rights to the duros technology for fields outside the specific fields licensed to us 
accordingly  alza may develop and commercialize duros based products or license others to do so  so long as there is no conflict with the rights granted to us 
alza recently received fda approval to market its first duros based product  viadur leuprolide acetate implants for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer 
if alza fails to commercialize this product successfully  or encounters problems associated with this product  negative publicity could be created about all duros based products  which could result in harm to our reputation and cause reduced sales of our products 
in addition  if any third party that may be licensed by alza fails to develop and commercialize duros based products successfully  the success of all duros based systems could be impeded  including ours  resulting in delay or loss of revenue or damage to our reputation  any one of which could harm our business 
we do not own the trademark duros and any competitive advantage we derive from the name may be impaired by third party use alza owns the trademark duros 
because alza is also developing and marketing duros based systems  and may license third parties to do so  there may be confusion in the market between alza  its potential licensees and us  and this confusion could impair the competitive advantage  if any  we derive from use of the duros name 
in addition  any actions taken by alza or its potential licensees that negatively impact the trademark duros could negatively impact our reputation and result in reduced sales of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical patents we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents and the breadth and scope of trade secret protection involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business or financial results cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming 
if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third party patents  we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced market share or incur costly litigation to protect our rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
as of december   we held four issued us patents and two issued foreign patent 
in addition  we have pending us patent applications and have filed patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty  from which national phase applications are currently pending in europe  australia and canada 
as of december   our subsidiary sbs held issued us patents  issued foreign patent and pending us patent applications and has filed patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
to maintain the license rights to alza intellectual property granted to us under our development and commercialization agreement with alza  we must meet annual minimum development spending requirements and fund development of a minimum number of products 
if we do not meet these diligence requirements  we may lose rights to one or more of our licensed fields 
also  under our agreement with alza  we must assign to alza any intellectual property rights relating to the duros system and its manufacture and any combination of the duros system with other components  active agents  features or processes 
in addition  alza retains the right to enforce and defend against infringement actions relating to the duros system  and if alza exercises these rights  it will be entitled to the proceeds of these infringement actions 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
in addition  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  our patent applications or those of alza that are licensed to us may not issue into patents  and any issued patents may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or circumvented 
our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as us law 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with us 
these agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances  and that all inventions arising out of the individual s relationship with us shall be our exclusive property 
these agreements may be breached  and in some instances  we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  reverse engineer our information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets  technical know how and other non patented technology 
we may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights is expensive  could cause diversion of our resources and may not prove successful 
any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing products 
we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our products we rely on third party contract research organizations  service providers and suppliers to provide critical services to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
for example  we currently depend on mds pharma  inc to perform blood plasma assays in connection with our clinical trials for chronogesic  nelson laboratories  inc to perform quality control services related to components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems  and da pro rubber inc to supply us with molded rubber components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
in the past  we relied on chesapeake biological labs  inc to perform the final manufacturing steps of our chronogesic product  and we may need to rely on a third party manufacturer again if we encounter delays in readying our manufacturing facility for production 
see we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to support our clinical and commercial requirements at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on these and other third party contractors to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
failure of these contractors to provide the required services in a timely manner or on reasonable commercial terms could materially delay the development and approval of our products  increase our expenses and materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
key components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems are provided by limited numbers of suppliers  and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in interruptions in supply or increased costs certain components and drug substances used in our duros based pharmaceutical systems are currently purchased from a single or a limited number of outside sources 
the reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in delays associated with redesigning a product due to a failure to obtain a single source component  an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  and reduced control over pricing  quality and time delivery 
we have a supply agreement with mallinckrodt  inc for our sufentanil requirements for our chronogesic product  which expires in september additionally  we have a supply agreement with rms company under which rms has agreed to supply us with titanium components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems until april other than these agreements  we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers  and therefore the supply of a particular component could be terminated at any time without penalty to the supplier 
any interruption in the supply of single source components could cause us to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture these components internally 
if the supply of any components for our pharmaceutical systems is interrupted  components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes within required timeframes  if at all  to meet our needs 
this could delay our ability to complete clinical trials and obtain approval for commercialization and marketing of our products  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs and delay new product introductions and could harm our reputation 
we lack marketing  sales and distribution experience for pharmaceutical systems and we may not be able to sell our products if we do not enter into relationships with third parties or develop a direct sales organization we have yet to establish marketing  sales or distribution capabilities for our pharmaceutical system products 
we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to sell our products or to develop our own sales and marketing force 
we may be unable to establish or maintain third party relationships on a commercially reasonable basis  if at all 
in addition  these third parties may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors  which may reduce their interest in selling our products 
if we do not enter into relationships with third parties for the sales and marketing of our products  we will need to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities 
durect has only limited experience in developing  training or managing a sales force 
if we choose to establish a direct sales force  we will incur substantial additional expenses in developing  training and managing such an organization 
we may be unable to build a sales force  the cost of establishing such a sales force may exceed our product revenues  or our direct marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful 
in addition  we compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against these other companies 
we may be unable to establish a sufficient sales and marketing organization on a timely basis  if at all 
we may be unable to engage qualified distributors 
even if engaged  these distributors may fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us  fail to adequately market our products  cease operations with little or no notice to us  or offer  design  manufacture or promote competing product lines 
if we fail to develop sales  marketing and distribution channels  we would experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs  which would harm our financial results 
if we are unable to train physicians to use our pharmaceutical systems to treat patients diseases or medical conditions  we may incur delays in market acceptance of our products broad use of our pharmaceutical systems will require extensive training of numerous physicians 
the time required to begin and complete training of physicians could delay introduction of our products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
we may be unable to rapidly train physicians in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our pharmaceutical systems 
any delay in training would materially delay the demand for our systems and harm our business and financial results 
in addition  we may expend significant funds towards such training before any orders are placed for our products  which would increase our expenses and harm our financial results 
investors may experience substantial dilution of their investment in the past  we have issued and have assumed pursuant to the sbs acquisition options to acquire common stock 
to the extent these outstanding options are ultimately exercised  there will be dilution to investors 
we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future our business currently does not generate sufficient revenues to meet our capital requirements and we do not expect that it will do so in the near future 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research  development and clinical testing of our products 
we will require additional funds for these purposes  to establish additional clinical and commercial scale manufacturing arrangements and facilities and to provide for the marketing and distribution of our products 
additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs which would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress and cost of our research and development programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  costs of developing sales  marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products  costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our products  competing technological and market developments  market acceptance of our products  and costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  convertible debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  we may have to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our product development efforts  or relinquish to alza rights to develop duros products in certain fields  resulting in loss of sales  increased costs  and reduced revenues 
write offs related to the impairment of long lived assets and other non cash charges  as well as future deferred compensation expenses may adversely impact or delay our profitability we may incur significant non cash charges related to impairment write downs of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce on december  however  we will continue to incur non cash charges related to amortization of other intangible assets 
we will be required to perform periodic impairment reviews of our goodwill and other long lived assets beginning in to the extent these reviews conclude that the expected future cash flows generated from our business activities are not sufficient to recover the cost of our long lived assets  we will be required to measure and record an impairment charge to write down these assets to their realizable values 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the initial impairment review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
if this initial review or future periodic reviews determine that our assets are impaired and a write down is required  it will adversely impact or delay our profitability 
to date  we have recorded deferred compensation expenses related to stock options grants  including stock options assumed in our acquisition of sbs  which will be amortized as follows million for the year ending december    for the year ending december    for the year ending december    for the year ending december   and  for the year ending december  in addition  deferred compensation expense related to option awards to non employees will be calculated during the vesting period of the option based on the then current price of our common stock  which could result in significant charges that adversely impact or delay our profitability 
furthermore  we have issued to alza common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock with an aggregate value of approximately million  which will be amortized over time based on sales of our products and which will also adversely impact or delay our profitability 
we depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time  and we need to hire additional qualified personnel our success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management  technical  and scientific personnel  including felix theeuwes  our chairman and chief scientific officer  james e 
brown  our president and chief executive officer and thomas a 
schreck  our chief financial officer 
although we have obtained key man life insurance policies for each of messrs 
theeuwes  brown and schreck in the amount of million  this insurance may not adequately compensate us for the loss of their services 
in addition  our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy 
we may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis  if at all 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the loss of the services of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  could result in delays to product development or approval  loss of sales and diversion of management resources 
we may not successfully manage our growth our success will depend on the expansion of our operations and the effective management of growth  which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
to manage such growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively our business would be harmed 
the market for our products is new  rapidly changing and competitive  and new products or technologies developed by others could impair our ability to grow our business and remain competitive the pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
developments by others may render our products under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete  or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors 
technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do  as well as substantially more marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
acquisitions of  or investments in  competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors financial  marketing  manufacturing and other resources 
we are a new enterprise and are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies 
as a result  our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies 
competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective or less costly than our products and  therefore  present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings 
the widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products even if commercialized 
chronic pain can also be treated by oral medication  transdermal drug delivery systems  such as drug patches  or with other implantable drug delivery devices 
these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us 
although we are insured against such risks up to a million annual aggregate limit in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our products  our present product liability insurance may be inadequate and may not fully cover the costs of any claim or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay 
product liability claims or other claims related to our products  regardless of their outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms 
in addition  product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical systems 
a product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay market acceptance of our products 
our business involves environmental risks and risks related to handling regulated substances in connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and products  we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws  regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development involves the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials  including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals  solvents  agents and biohazardous materials 
the extent of our use  generation and disposal of such substances has increased substantially since our acquisition of sbs  which  through its subsidiary birmingham polymers  inc  is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling biodegradable polymers 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances generated by us  and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances 
the costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large 
in the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
our stock price may fluctuate  and your investment in our stock could decline in value the average daily trading volume of our common stock for the twelve months ending december   was  shares 
the limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility  and an active trading market in our stock might not develop or continue 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology and pharmaceutical companies have also been extremely volatile  and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which could cause a decline in the value of our investors stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price commencing on march   which was days after the date of our initial public offering  as many as  shares of our common stock became available for sale in the public market  subject to applicable securities laws 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of sbs  we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s under the securities act with respect to the  shares of common stock issued to the former sbs shareholders or issuable upon the exercise of warrants and certain options we assumed 
the common stock issued in connection with this acquisition became freely tradable in the public market after this registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
further information regarding the sbs acquisition is included in the company s current report on form k filed with the sec on may  we may also seek to raise capital through equity or convertible debt financings or through the sale of equity or convertible securities to collaboration or commercialization partners 
such financing activities may increase the number of shares of our common stock being sold in the public markets 
if substantial amounts of our common stock were to be sold in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  these sales could create the perception to the public of difficulties or problems in our business 
as a result  these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we have broad discretion over the use of our cash and investments  and their investment may not yield a favorable return our management has broad discretion over how our cash and investments are used and may invest in ways with which our stockholders may not agree and that do not yield favorable returns 
executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them have substantial control over us  which could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control favored by our other stockholders our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders  together with their affiliates have substantial control over us 
the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  would have the ability to exercise control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including the election of directors  the amendment of charter documents  the approval of certain mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders  providing for a dividend on our common stock  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which can be triggered after a person or group acquires or more of common stock  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  auction rate securities  corporate bonds and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase 
in october  we financed the purchase of certain equipment through a bank loan of  with a variable interest rate 
the average interest rates were and in and  respectively 
at december  and  we had loans outstanding in the amounts of  and  respectively
