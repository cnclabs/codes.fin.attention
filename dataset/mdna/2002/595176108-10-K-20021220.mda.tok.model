revenues from product sales are recorded as the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and the collection of the related receivable is probable 
billings in advance of the company s performance of such work are reflected as customer deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances

the company has deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies
