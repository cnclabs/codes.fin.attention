net income was million for  an increase of million  or  from million for for  net income was million 
diluted earnings per share on net income were per share for  compared to per share for and per share for operating segments emcor s business consists of the following operating segments united states electrical construction and facilities services  united states mechanical construction and facilities services  united states other services  canada construction and facilities services  united kingdom construction and facilities services and other international construction and facilities services 
the segments i united states other services primarily represents those operations which principally provide energy consulting  maintenance  office and facility management  and central energy systems monitoring services and ii other international construction and facilities services represents emcor s operations outside of the united states  canada  and the united kingdom  primarily south africa  the middle east and europe  performing electrical construction  mechanical construction and facilities services 
results of operations emcor s significant accounting policies are described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
emcor believes its most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long term contracts for which emcor uses the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term contracts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and accordingly the method used for revenue recognition within emcor s industry 
percentage of completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
certain of emcor s electrical contracting business units measure percentage of completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor costs for such contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts within the consolidated balance sheets 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of the contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of the contract 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also includes amounts emcor seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs 
such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value 
due to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply percentage of completion accounting  it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in the consolidated financial statements prospectively 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  decreased to billion  compared to billion of revenues for the million decrease in revenues for compared to was primarily due to reduced levels of fast track data center construction in the new york  chicago  washington d

the million  or  increase in revenues compared to  was attributable to both new construction and renovation and retrofit jobs for commercial construction and the communication infrastructure and technology markets 
partially offsetting this overall increase was a decrease in new construction revenues from casino work  although this was partially offset by increased renovation and retrofit work at casinos 
additionally  industrial construction related renovation and retrofit revenues decreased principally due to industrial facilities not having as many shut downs in production to perform major maintenance during united states mechanical construction and facilities services revenues decreased million  or 
the decrease in revenues was due to reduced levels of fast track data center construction  reduced levels of activity in the las vegas and denver markets and planned reductions in operations at emcor s poole kent subsidiary operations in the north and south carolina markets 
the decrease in rev enues was partially offset by increased revenues associated with energy generation construction on the west and east coasts and increased revenues from the boston area market 
a million  or  increase in revenues for compared to was primarily attributable to revenue growth from emcor s operations excluding acquisitions 
eastern and western united states based operations were the major contributors to the increase in revenues due to the continued strong renovation market and new construction market in new york city  houston  connecticut  denver and california 
revenues from acquisitions contributed approximately million of the increase

revenues of canada construction and facilities services decreased by million  or  for as compared to revenues 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to project start date delays in eastern canada and a reduction of revenues in western canada due to timing of anticipated projects

the increase in revenues was due to projects performed in europe by emcor s new technology division 
the remainder of the work performed in this operating segment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting because emcor has less than majority ownership in these foreign joint ventures  and accordingly  revenues attributable to such joint ventures are not reflected as revenues in the consolidated financial statements 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in these markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east

other international construction and facilities services operating losses were million for compared to operating income of million in and operating losses of million in these operating losses in were attributable to project losses related to a middle east joint venture  partially offset by operating income for projects in the new technology division in europe 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern  south african and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
therefore  the business activities in this segment were not significant for and general corporate expenses for increased by million from levels  and increased by million between and the increases are attributable to increased variable overhead costs associated with marketing and business development efforts  including transfer from subsidiary operations to corporate administration of certain individuals  some of whom were previously involved in subsidiary operations  to monitor emcor s overall operations  provide strategic direction and support future business activity 
additionally  operations support activities such as information technology infrastructure support have been expanded to meet the level of service expected by our clients

on december   emcor restated a june  credit facility  the amended credit facility provides emcor with a credit facility for borrowings of up to million 
the amended credit facility  which has an expiration date of june   is guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of emcor 
the amended credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of emcor and most of its subsidiaries  and it provides for borrowing capacity available in the form of revolving loans and or letters of credit 
the amended credit facility contains various covenants  including among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and significant restrictions with respect to cumulative aggregate payments for dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness  capital expenditures  and prepayments of subordinated debt  all as set forth therein 
the annual facility fee is per  of the total credit facility 
the revolving loans bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris trust and savings bank from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or at a libor rate at december  plus to based on certain financial tests 
the interest rates in effect at december  were and  respectively 
letters of credit fees issued under the credit facility ranging from to are charged based on type of letters of credit issued and certain financial tests 
as of december  and  emcor had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
no revolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility at december  or in december  the company s canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  renewed a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or a subsidiary of emcor has guaranteed indebtedness of a venture in which it has a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in cooling 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material adverse effect on emcor s financial position or results of operations 
under one guarantee  each of the venturers is jointly and severally liable for the venture s million borrowing due december the other guarantee is related to the venture s million revolving credit facility expiring september  under which emcor s subsidiary guaranteed of the indebtedness 
emcor believes that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under lines of credit  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
the primary source of liquidity for emcor has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
emcor also maintains a credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event that net cash generated by operating activities is insufficient  or to enable emcor to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the credit facility  and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based on its current credit rating and financial condition  emcor can reasonably expect to be able to issue medium and long term debt instruments or equity 
emcor s primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in order to provide protection against demand cycles in private sector construction services  emcor has increased its participation  and its backlog of contracts  in the public sector and in facilities services 
liquidity will be impacted in future periods by emcor s recent agreement to acquire nineteen subsidiaries of comfort systems usa  inc comfort systems
