item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general over the past several years  our business activities and operations have grown dramatically as a result of significant acquisitions  transactions  and internal growth initiatives that have enhanced our ability to compete in the global energy industry 
this growth has significantly expanded our operating scope  our ability to generate operating cash flows and our needs for cash for investment opportunities 
consequently  we have substantially expanded our credit facilities and entered into other financing arrangements and facilities to meet our needs during this period 
the more significant events are discussed below 
merger with the coastal corporation in january  we merged with the coastal corporation 
we accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests and converted each share of coastal common stock and class a common stock on a tax free basis into shares of our common stock 
we also exchanged coastal s outstanding convertible preferred stock for our common stock on the same basis as if the preferred stock had been converted into coastal common stock immediately prior to the merger 
we issued a total of million shares  including million shares issued to holders of coastal stock options 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations reflects the combined information of our two companies for all periods presented 
in connection with a federal trade commission ftc order related to this merger  in we sold our gulfstream pipeline project and midwestern gas transmission system and our investments in the empire state  stingray  u t offshore and iroquois pipeline systems 
proceeds from these sales were approximately million and we recognized an extraordinary gain of million  net of income taxes of million  on these transactions 
purchase of texas midstream operations in december  we completed our purchase of pacific gas electric s pg e s texas midstream operations for million  including million of assumed debt 
we accounted for this acquisition as a purchase 
the assets acquired consist of  miles of intrastate natural gas transmission and natural gas liquids pipelines that transport approximately bcf d  nine natural gas processing plants that process bcf d and rights to bcf of natural gas storage capacity 
these assets serve a majority of the metropolitan areas and the largest industrial load centers in texas  as well as numerous natural gas trading hubs 
these assets also create a physical link between our epng and tgp systems 
results from this acquisition are reflected in our results of operations from the date of purchase 
in december  to comply with an ftc order  we sold our interest in oasis pipeline company 
proceeds from the sale were million  and we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes of million 
in march  we sold some of the acquired natural gas liquids transportation and fractionation assets to el paso energy partners for approximately million 
the assets sold included more than miles of natural gas liquids gathering and transportation pipelines and three fractionation plants located in south texas 
in february  we announced the sale of the remaining natural gas transmission assets to el paso energy partners 
see a further discussion of this sale under our discussion of the segment operating results for the field services segment 
merger with sonat inc in october  we completed our merger with sonat  inc we accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests and converted each share of sonat common stock into one share of our common stock 
we issued approximately million shares 
in connection with an ftc order related to this merger  we sold our east tennessee natural gas company and sea robin pipeline company pipeline systems as well as our one third interest in the destin pipeline company system 
proceeds from the sales were approximately million  and we recognized an extraordinary gain of million  net of income taxes of million 
balance sheet enhancement plan in december  we announced a plan to strengthen our capital structure and enhance our liquidity in response to changes in market conditions in our industry 
this plan involves the sale of assets  a reduction in capital spending  the issuance of equity and the elimination or renegotiation of the rating triggers for several of our financing arrangements 
the goal of the plan is to reduce our debt to total capital ratio to percent by the end of for further information about this plan  see the discussion under future liquidity 
merger related costs  asset impairments and other charges below are the charges incurred that had a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows for each of the three years ended december in millions merger related costs  asset impairments total merger related costs and asset impairments  changes in accounting estimates ceiling test charges merger related costs 
our merger related costs relate to our mergers with coastal and sonat and consisted of the following for each of the three years ended december in millions employee severance  retention and transition costs transaction costs business and operational integration costs merger related asset impairments other employee severance  retention and transition costs include direct payments to  and benefit costs for  severed employees and early retirees that occurred as a result of our merger related workforce reduction and consolidation 
following the coastal merger  we completed an employee restructuring across all of our operating segments  resulting in the reduction of  full time positions through a combination of early retirements and terminations 
following the sonat merger  a total of approximately full time positions were eliminated in a similar restructuring 
employee severance costs include actual severance payments and costs for pension and post retirement benefits settled and curtailed under existing benefit plans as a result of these restructurings 
retention charges include payments to employees who were retained following the mergers and payments to employees to satisfy contractual obligations 
transition costs relate to costs to relocate employees and costs for severed and retired employees arising after their severance date to transition their jobs into the ongoing workforce 
the pension and post retirement benefits were accrued on the merger date and will be paid over the applicable benefit periods of the terminated and retired employees 
all other costs were expensed as incurred and have been paid 
also included in the employee severance  retention and transition costs was a charge of million resulting from the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock on the date of the coastal merger in exchange for the fair value of coastal employees and directors stock options 
transaction costs include investment banking  legal  accounting  consulting and other advisory fees incurred to obtain federal and state regulatory approvals and take other actions necessary to complete our mergers 
all of these items were expensed in the periods in which they were incurred 
business and operational integration costs include charges to consolidate facilities and operations of our business segments  such as lease termination and abandonment charges  recognition of the mark to market value of energy trading contracts resulting from changes in how these contracts are managed under our combined operating strategy and incremental fees under software and seismic license agreements 
also included in the charges are approximately million in estimated lease related costs to relocate our pipeline operations from detroit  michigan to houston  texas and from el paso  texas to colorado springs  colorado 
these charges were accrued at the time we completed our relocations and closed these offices 
the amounts accrued will be paid over the term of the applicable non cancelable lease agreements 
all other costs were expensed as incurred 
merger related asset impairments relate to write offs or write downs of capitalized costs for duplicate systems  redundant facilities and assets whose value was impaired as a result of decisions on the strategic direction of our combined operations following our merger with coastal 
these charges occurred in our merchant energy  production and pipelines segments  and all of these assets have either had their operations suspended or continue to be held for use 
the charges taken were based on a comparison of the cost of the assets to their estimated fair value to the ongoing operations based on this change in operating strategy 
other costs include payments made in satisfaction of obligations arising from the ftc approval of our merger with coastal and other miscellaneous charges 
these items were expensed in the period in which they were incurred 
asset impairments 
the asset impairment charges resulted from the write downs of our investments in several international power projects in our merchant energy segment and several telecommunications investments in our corporate and other operations 
the charges consisted of the impairment of coal mining and refining assets in our merchant energy segment and a gas processing facility in our field services segment 
the charge occurred in the pipeline segment and was derived from impairments of regulatory assets that were not recoverable based on the settlement of a rate case 
the impairments in all periods were primarily a result of weak or changing economic conditions causing permanent declines in the value of these assets  and the charges taken for all assets were based on a comparison of each asset s carrying value to its estimated fair value based on future estimated cash flows 
these assets continue to be held for use  or their operations have been suspended 
changes in accounting estimates 
our changes in accounting estimates consist of million in additional environmental remediation liabilities  million of additional accrued legal obligations and a million charge to reduce the value of our spare parts inventories to reflect changes in the usability of these parts in our worldwide operations 
these changes were primarily the result of several events that occurred as part of and following our merger with coastal  including the consolidation of numerous operating locations  the sale of a majority of our retail gas stations  the shutdown of our midwest refining operations and the lease of our corpus christi refinery 
these changes were also a direct result of a fire at our aruba refinery 
also impacting these amounts was the evaluation of the operating standards  strategies and plans of our combined company following the merger 
these charges are included as operating expenses in our income statement and reduced our net income before extraordinary items and net income for the year ended december   by approximately million 
ceiling test charges 
under the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties  we perform quarterly ceiling tests to evaluate whether the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties exceeds the present value of future net revenues  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
during the third quarter of  capitalized costs exceeded this ceiling limit by million  including million for our canadian full cost pool  million for our brazilian full cost pool and million for other international production operations  primarily in turkey 
these charges were based on the november  daily posted oil and natural gas sales prices 
during  we incurred charges related to our us full cost pool of million based on end of period natural gas and oil prices 
the natural gas and oil prices used in both periods were adjusted for oilfield or gas gathering hub and wellhead price differences as appropriate 
these non cash write downs are included in our income statement as ceiling test charges 
we use financial instruments to hedge against volatility of natural gas and oil prices 
the impact of these hedges was considered in the determination of our ceiling test charge during  and will be factored into future ceiling test calculations 
had the impact of our hedges not been included in calculating our ceiling test charge  the charge would not have materially changed since we do not significantly hedge our international production activities 
also as mentioned above  our charge was computed based on daily posted prices on november  had we computed this charge based on the daily oil and natural gas prices as of september   the charge would have been approximately million  including approximately million for our canadian full cost pool and million for our brazilian and other international production operations  including the impact on future cash flows of our hedging program 
had the impact of our hedging program been excluded  the charges would have been approximately the same for our international full costs pools and production operations  but we would have incurred an additional charge of approximately million related to our us full cost pool 
results of operations our results of operations  along with the impact  by segment  of the merger related  asset impairment and other charges discussed above  extraordinary items and accounting changes for each of the three years ended december were as follows ebit by segment reported charges pro forma reported charges pro forma reported charges pro forma pipelines       merchant energy  production  field services segment ebit       corporate and other   consolidated ebit        interest and debt expense     minority interest income taxes extraordinary items accounting changes net income     pro forma amounts should not be used as a substitute for amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles 
they are presented solely to improve the understanding of the impact of the charges reported during the periods presented 
in  these gains were a result of ftc ordered sales in connection with our coastal merger  including the sales of our gulfstream pipeline project and midwestern gas transmission system and our investments in the empire state  stingray  u t offshore and iroquois pipeline systems 
in  these gains were a result of ftc ordered sales in connection with our sonat merger  including the sales of our east tennessee and sea robin pipeline systems 
segment results our four segments pipelines  merchant energy  production and field services are strategic business units that offer a variety of different energy products and services  each requiring different technology and marketing strategies 
we evaluate our segment performance based on earnings before interest expense and income taxes  or ebit 
operating revenues and expenses by segment include intersegment revenues and expenses which are eliminated in consolidation 
because changes in energy commodity prices have a similar impact on both our operating revenues and cost of products sold from period to period  we believe that gross margin revenue less cost of sales provides a more accurate and meaningful basis for analyzing operating results for the trading and refining portions of merchant energy and for the field services segment
