overview persistence software solves data access problems for distributed and real time systems 
persistence solutions help deliver better business visibility for applications which require current information about customers  products and suppliers 
persistence provides a suite of data management products that sit between existing databases such as oracle and db and or application servers such as weblogic and websphere 
developers can configure these products to structure and position business information with optimal efficiency  improving application server performance and simplifying application distribution while reducing database costs 
persistence is a leading provider of software for the management of distributed data throughout an enterprise without the need for replicated data centers 
by effectively managing enterprise data  users achieve the benefit of business visibility the ability to manage their businesses in real time with data and applications where they need them  when they need them 
we were incorporated and began operations in our products incorporate patented object to relational mapping and caching technologies 
we have continually enhanced our products  including a patented data transformation technology for mapping objects to database tables  and caching capabilities 
in  we developed our powertier transactional application server  which integrates all of the previously released persistence products with new shared transactional caching technologies  which enable multiple users to simultaneously access the same cached data 
we first shipped our powertier for c transactional application server in sales of powertier for c accounted for the majority of our revenues in   and  during which years we added a professional services staff to enable our customers to implement powertier more rapidly 
we were one of the first companies to adopt and implement the jee formerly known as ejb specification 
in  we introduced powertier for ejb now jee  which customers have frequently purchased together with powertier for c 
our most recent version of powertier for jee is currently in use by several major customers and was commercially released in september we currently plan to continue to focus product development efforts on enhancements to both the powertier for c and the powertier for jee products  as well as our edgextend product 
our revenues  which consist of software license revenues and service revenues  totaled million in  million in and million in license revenues consist of licenses of our software products  which generally are priced based on the number of users or servers 
service revenues consist of professional services consulting  customer support and training 
because we only commenced selling application servers in  we have a limited operating history in the application server market 
we expect that  as a percentage of total revenues  sales of powertier for jee and edgextend products will increase and sales of powertier for c will decrease in the future 
we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organizations in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  and hong kong 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million in  million in and million in which represented approximately of total revenues for  for and for our future success will depend  in part  on our successful development of international markets for our products 
historically  we have received a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales to a limited number of customers 
sales of products to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in in addition  the identity of our top five customers has changed from year to year 
in the future  it is likely that a relatively few large customers could continue to account for a relatively large proportion of our revenues 
to date  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force 
we plan to hire sales people  in particular those with expertise in channel sales  in order to meet our sales goals 
in addition  our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and leveraging relationships with oem partners and other resellers 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
future implementation guidance relating to these standards or any future standards may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices  and these changes could affect our future revenues and earnings 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provided guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
sab no 
outlines basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
the company implemented sab no 
in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  the provisions of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we recognize license revenues upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  an executed agreement has been signed  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services 
for sales made through distributors  revenue is recognized upon shipment 
distributors have no right of return 
we recognize revenues from customer training  support and consulting services as the services are performed 
we generally recognize support revenues ratably over the term of the support contract 
if support or professional services are included in an arrangement that includes a license agreement  amounts related to support or professional services are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence for support and professional services is based on the price when such elements are sold separately  or  when not sold separately  the price established by management having the relevant authority to make such decision 
arrangements that require significant modification or customization of software are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
since inception  we have incurred substantial research and development costs and have invested heavily in the expansion of our sales  marketing and professional services organizations to build an infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
the number of our employees decreased from as of december  to as of december   representing a decrease of 
we have incurred net losses in each quarter since and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we are currently targeting that sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  and general and administrative expenses  will remain below the levels incurred during we expect to achieve a modest net profit on a gaap basis for we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
our success depends significantly upon broad market acceptance of our powertier for jee application server and our more recently introduced caching products  dynamai and edgextend 
because sun microsystems controls the jee standard  we need to maintain a good working relationship with them to develop future versions of powertier for jee  as well as additional products using the jee standard 
our performance will also depend on the level of capital spending in our target market of customers and on the growth and widespread adoption of the market for business to business electronic commerce over the internet 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring and recognizing revenue 
revenue results are difficult to forecast  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
bad debts 
our bad debt policy requires that we maintain a specific allowance for certain doubtful accounts and a general allowance for the majority of the non specifically reserved accounts 
these allowances provide for estimated losses resulting from the inability or refusal of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate further  additional allowances would generally be required 
purchased technology and intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements and operating results 
accordingly in  the company took an impairment charge of million 
income taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required

cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods due to our use of third party professional services 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  travel and entertainment  and promotional expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were million for and million for  representing a decrease of

general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for and of total revenues for we are presently targeting that general and administrative expense levels will be lower than comparable expense levels 
amortization and write down of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles was million for and million for representing an increase of 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to write off of intangibles and goodwill of million in june restructuring costs 
the company restructured several functions within its operations in this resulted in one time charges of million 
the majority of these charges related to severance and other employee related benefit costs 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense consists primarily of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  offset by interest expense related to obligations under capital leases and other borrowings  and various miscellaneous state and foreign taxes  and other expenses 
interest and other income expense was  for and million for  representing a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our short term investment balances and a general reduction in market interest rates 
we expect that interest and other income expense will decrease as we continue to use our net proceeds from our initial public offering and may become a net expense in stock based compensation 
some options granted and common stock issued in the past have been considered to be compensatory  as the estimated fair value of the stock price for accounting purposes was greater than the fair market value of the stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant or issuance 
total deferred stock compensation associated with equity transactions as of december  was  net of amortization 
deferred stock compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of these securities

since inception  we have incurred net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire through  while the state net operating loss carryforwards expire through the net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes are substantially less than for federal tax purposes  primarily because only of state net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized to offset future state taxable income and because state net operating loss carryforwards generated in earlier years have already expired 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss carryforwards in situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
if we should be acquired or otherwise have an ownership change  as defined in the tax reform act of  our utilization of these carryforwards could be restricted 
as of december   the company also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal credit carryforward expires in  while the state credit carryforward has no expiration 
we have placed a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
if and when we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced

these factors include o our ability to close relatively large sales on schedule  o delays or deferrals of customer orders or deployments  o delays in shipment of scheduled software releases  o demand for and market acceptance of our powertier products and our newer dynamai and edgextend products  o introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  o annual or quarterly budget cycles of our customers  o the level of product and price competition in the application server and distributed dynamic caching markets  o our lengthy sales cycle  o our success in maintaining our direct sales force and expanding indirect distribution channels  o the mix of direct sales versus indirect distribution channel sales  o the mix of products and services licensed or sold  o the mix of domestic and international sales  and o our success in international markets and general economic conditions in these markets 
the typical sales cycle of our products is long and unpredictable  and is affected by seasonal fluctuations as a result of our customers fiscal year budgeting cycles and slow summer purchasing patterns in europe 
we typically receive a substantial portion of our orders in the last two weeks of each quarter because our customers often delay purchases of our products to the end of the quarter to gain price concessions 
because a substantial portion of our costs are relatively fixed and based on anticipated revenues  a failure to book an expected order in a given quarter would not be offset by a corresponding reduction in costs and could adversely affect our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through our initial public offering of common stock in june  which totaled million in aggregate net proceeds  and private sales of convertible preferred stock  which totaled million in aggregate net proceeds 
we have also financed our business through equipment related loans in the maximum principal amount of  a second equipment related loan in the amount of  and capitalized leases 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  million for  and million for for each of  and  cash used for operating activities was attributable primarily to net operating losses 
these losses were offset by depreciation and amortization expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for net cash used in investing activities was  for  and million for for  cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of the sale of short term investments 
for  cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment and purchased intangibles  offset by the sale of short term investments 
for  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments  purchased intangibles and property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was  for net cash provided by financing activities was million for and million for net cash used in financing activities during consisted primarily of repayments of capital leases and loan agreements offset by the sale of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during and was primarily attributable to the sale of common stock 
for and  net cash was also provided from borrowings under an equipment financing facility  offset by repayments of loan agreements 
we have credit facilities with comerica bank 
under those credit facilities  the company has a million revolving line of credit facility available through april   an  equipment term loan  and a second equipment term loan of  as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit facility 
as of december   we had a promissory note in favor of comerica bank related to our first equipment term loan  under which  out of an original  was outstanding 
we are required to make principal payments of  per month plus interest at per annum on the unpaid principal balance  payable in monthly installments 
as of december  we had  outstanding under the second equipment term loan 
we are required to make principal payments of  per month  plus interest at the bank s base rate plus per annum payable in monthly installments 
the bank s credit facilities require the company  among other things  to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million and a minimum quick ratio current assets not including inventory less current liabilities of to as of both june  and september   the company s tangible net worth fell below the minimum tangible net worth ratio then in effect  and the bank waived both of those previous events 
as of december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
borrowings under the facilities are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  the impact of adopting this standard is not expected to be material to our financial statements as the company does not currently carry any goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  but does not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
additional factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
the risks and uncertainties described below are intended to be the ones that are specific to our company or industry and that we deem to be material  but are not the only ones that we face 
we have a limited operating history in the application server market 
because we only commenced selling application servers in  we have a limited operating history in the application server market 
we thus face the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in the rapidly changing software industry 
these risks include o the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures by our customers and prospective customers  o our substantial dependence for revenue from our powertier for c product  which was first introduced in and has achieved only limited market acceptance  o our substantial dependence for revenue from our powertier for ejb jee product  which was first introduced in and has achieved only limited market acceptance  o our need to expand our distribution capability through various sales channels  including a direct sales organization  original equipment manufacturers  third party distributors and systems integrators  o our unproven ability to anticipate and respond to technological and competitive developments in the rapidly changing market for application servers  o our unproven ability to compete in a highly competitive market  o uncertainty as to the growth rate in the software infrastructure market  o our need to achieve market acceptance for our new product introductions  including dynamai and edgextend  o our dependence on enterprise javabeans  commonly known as ejb jee  becoming a widely accepted standard in the transactional application server market  and o our dependence upon key personnel 
because we have a history of losses and negative cash flow  we may never become or remain profitable 
we may not achieve our targeted revenues and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we have incurred net losses each year since in particular  we incurred losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
while we are currently targeting decreases in sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses for as compared to such expenses  we will still need to achieve our revenue targets to become profitable 
because our product markets are new and evolving  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate  if any  or the ultimate size of the market for our products 
we have financed our business through the sale of stock and not through cash generated by our operations 
since inception  we have generally had negative cash flow from operations 
to date  we have financed our business primarily through sales of common stock and convertible preferred stock and not through cash generated by our operations 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
based upon our current forecasts and estimates  we are targeting that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs through at least december  however  we may need to raise additional funds prior to that time 
we face several risks in connection with this possible need to raise additional capital o the issuance of additional securities could result in o debt securities with rights senior to the common stock  o dilution to existing stockholders as a result of issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  o debt securities with restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to run our business as desired  or o securities issued on disadvantageous financial terms 
o the failure to procure needed funding could result in o a dramatic reduction in scope in our planned product development or marketing efforts  or o an inability to respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of market opportunities 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could jeopardize our business 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in prior years  we have often experienced an absolute decline in revenues from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the next year 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following o our ability to close relatively large sales on schedule  o delays or deferrals of customer orders or deployments  o delays in shipment of scheduled software releases  o demand for and market acceptance of our powertier products and our newer dynamai and edgextend products  o the possible loss of sales people  o introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  o annual or quarterly budget cycles of our customers  o the level of product and price competition in the application server and distributed dynamic caching markets  o our lengthy sales cycle  o our success in maintaining our direct sales force and expanding indirect distribution channels  o the mix of direct sales versus indirect distribution channel sales  o the mix of products and services licensed or sold  o the mix of domestic and international sales  and o our success in penetrating international markets and general economic conditions in these markets 
we typically receive a substantial portion of our orders in the last two weeks of each fiscal quarter because our customers often delay purchases of our products to the end of the quarter to gain price concessions 
because a substantial portion of our costs are relatively fixed and based on anticipated revenues  a failure to book an expected order in a given quarter would not be offset by a corresponding reduction in costs and could adversely affect our operating results 
our sales cycle is long  unpredictable and subject to seasonal fluctuations  so it is difficult to forecast our revenues 
any delay in sales of our products or services could cause our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
the typical sales cycle of our products is long and unpredictable and requires both a significant capital investment decision by our customers and our education of potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
our sales cycle is generally between three and nine months 
a successful sales cycle typically includes presentations to both business and technical decision makers  as well as a limited pilot program to establish a technical fit 
our products typically are purchased as part of a significant enhancement to a customer s information technology system 
the implementation of our products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
accordingly  a purchase decision for a potential customer typically requires the approval of several senior decision makers 
our sales cycle is affected by the business conditions of each prospective customer  as well as the overall economic climate for technology related capital expenditures 
due to the relative importance of many of our product sales  a lost or delayed sale could adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycle is affected by seasonal fluctuations as a result of our customers fiscal year budgeting cycles and slow summer purchasing patterns in europe 
we depend on a relatively small number of significant customers  and the loss of one or more of these customers could result in a decrease in our revenues 
historically  we have received a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to a limited number of customers 
in the year ended december   sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
sales to salomon smith barney accounted for of total revenues and sales to cablevision accounted for of total revenues 
in year ended december   sales to salomon smith barney accounted for of total revenues and sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
in year ended december   sales to cisco accounted for of our total revenues  and sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
in year ended december   sales to cisco accounted for of our total revenues  sales to instinet accounted for of our total revenues  and sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
in addition  the identity of our top five customers has changed from year to year 
if we lose a significant customer  or fail to increase sales to an existing customer as planned  we may not be able to replace the lost revenues with sales to other customers 
in addition  because our marketing strategy is to concentrate on sales to industry leaders  any loss of a customer could harm our reputation within the industry and make it harder for us to sell to other companies in that industry 
the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  one or more significant customers would likely result in a decrease in our revenues 
we depend on the java programming language  the enterprise javabeans standard and the emerging market for distributed object computing  and if these technologies fail to gain acceptance  our business could suffer 
we are focusing certain portions of our marketing efforts on our powertier for jee application server  which is based on three relatively new technologies  which have not been widely adopted by a large number of companies 
these three technologies are a distributed object computing architecture  sun microsystems java programming language and jee formerly ejb 
distributed object computing combines the use of software modules  or objects  communicating across a computer network to software applications  such as our powertier application server 
jee is the java programming standard for use in an application server 
in  we launched our powertier for ejb product  which is a transactional application server that uses java and conformed to the ejb standard 
sun microsystems released the ejb standard in  and thus far ejb has had limited market acceptance 
since our powertier for jee product depends upon the specialized jee standard  we face a limited market compared to competitors who may offer application servers based on more widely accepted standards  including the java programming language 
we expect a material portion of our future revenues will come from sales of products based on the jee standard 
thus  our success depends significantly upon broad market acceptance of distributed object computing in general  and java application servers in particular 
if jee does not become a widespread programming standard for application servers  our revenues and business could suffer 
if we do not deliver products that meet rapidly changing technology standards and customer demands  we will lose market share to our competitors 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  dynamic customer demands and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
customer requirements for products can change rapidly as a result of innovation in software applications and hardware configurations and the emergence or adoption of new industry standards  including internet technology standards 
we may need to increase our research and development investment to maintain our technological leadership 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments 
for example  as sun microsystems introduces new jee specifications  we will need to introduce new versions of powertier for jee designed to support these new specifications to remain competitive 
if we do not bring enhancements and new versions of our products to market in a timely manner  our market share and revenues could decrease and our reputation could suffer 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer needs  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and business could suffer 
our edgextend products are currently in beta testing 
any delays in releasing these products on a generally available basis may materially affect our future revenues 
edgextend for websphere is scheduled to be released in march edgextend for weblogic is scheduled to be released in june we are currently targeting that some portion of our revenues will be derived from sales of our newest product  edgextend  however there are technical and market risks associated with new products 
we are currently targeting that sales of our edgextend products will represent some percentage of our revenues 
new products  like edgextend  often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced 
any errors or defects could be serious or difficult to correct and could result in a delay of product adoption resulting in lost revenues or a delay in gaining market share  which could harm our revenues and reputation 
in addition  market adoption is often slower for newer products  like edgextend  than for existing products 
because our direct sales team is currently our most critical sales channel  any failure to build and train and maintain this team may result in lower revenues 
we must maintain a strong direct sales team to generate revenues 
in the last several years  we have experienced significant turnover in our sales team  and in the third quarter of  we implemented a reduction in force and substantially reorganized our sales team 
in order to meet our future sales goals  we may need to hire more salespeople for both our domestic and international sales efforts 
in the past  newly hired employees have required training and approximately six to nine months experience to achieve full productivity 
like many companies in the software industry  we are likely to continue to experience turnover in our sales force 
as a result of our recent restructuring  a number of our sales people are relatively new and we may not meet our sales goals 
in addition  our recently hired employees may not become productive  and we may not be able to hire enough qualified individuals in the future 
because our future revenue goals are based on our development of a strong sales channel through oem partners and other resellers  any failure to develop this channel may result in lower revenues 
to date  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force  but our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in establishing and leveraging relationships with oem partners and third parties 
it may be difficult for us to establish these relationships  and  even if we establish these relationships  we will then depend on the sales efforts of these third parties 
in addition  because these relationships are nonexclusive  these third parties may choose to sell application servers or other alternative solutions offered by our competitors  and not our products 
if we fail to successfully build our third party distribution channels or if our third party partners do not perform as expected  our business could be harmed 
because our products are often incorporated into enterprise wide system deployments  any delays in these projects may result in lower revenues 
because our products are often incorporated into multi million dollar enterprise projects  we depend on the successful and timely completion of these large projects to fully deploy our products and achieve our revenue goals 
these enterprise projects often take many years to complete and can be delayed by a variety of factors  including general or industry specific economic downturns  our customers budget constraints  other customer specific delays  problems with other system components or delays caused by the oem or other third party partners who may be managing the system deployment 
if our customers cannot successfully implement large scale deployments  or they determine for any reason that our products cannot accommodate large scale deployments or that our products are not appropriate for widespread use  our business could suffer 
in addition  if an oem or other third party partner fails to complete a project utilizing our product for a customer in a timely manner  our revenues or business reputation could suffer 
because we compete with sun microsystems  who controls the ejb jee application server standard  we face the risk that it may develop this standard to favor its own products 
our success depends on achieving widespread market acceptance of our powertier for jee application server 
because sun microsystems controls the jee standard  we need to maintain a good working relationship with sun microsystems to develop future versions of powertier for jee  as well as additional products using jee  that will gain market acceptance 
in march  we entered into a license agreement with sun microsystems  pursuant to which we granted sun microsystems rights to manufacture and sell  by itself and not jointly with others  products under a number of our patents  and sun microsystems granted us rights to manufacture and sell  by ourselves and not jointly with others  products under a number of sun microsystems patents 
as a result  sun microsystems may develop and sell some competing products that would  in the absence of this license agreement  infringe our patents 
because sun microsystems controls the jee standard  it could develop the jee standard in a more proprietary way to favor a product offered by its subsidiary  i planet  or a third party  which could make it much harder for us to compete in the jee application server market 
microsoft has established a competing application server standard  which could diminish the market potential for our products if it gains widespread acceptance 
microsoft has established a competing standard for distributed computing  com  which includes an application server product 
if this standard gains widespread market acceptance over the jee or corba standards  on which our products are based  our business would suffer 
because of microsoft s resources and commanding position with respect to other markets and technologies  microsoft s entry into the application server market may cause our potential customers to delay or change purchasing decisions 
we expect that microsoft s presence in the application server market will increase competitive pressure in this market 
we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have and may face additional competition in the future 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are o performance  including scalability  integrity and availability  o ability to provide a complete software platform  o flexibility  o use of standards based technology eg jee  o ease of integration with customers existing enterprise systems  o ease and speed of implementation  o quality of support and service  o security  o company reputation  and o price 
our competitors for powertier  dynamai and edgextend include both publicly and privately held enterprises  including bea systems weblogic  secant technologies  ibm websphere  oracle oas and i planet sun microsystems 
many customers may not be willing to purchase our powertier platform because they have already invested heavily in databases and other enterprise software components offered by these competing companies 
many of these competitors have preexisting customer relationships  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger installed bases of customers than we do 
in addition  some competitors offer products that are less complex than our powertier products and require less customization to implement with potential customers existing systems 
thus  potential customers engaged in simpler business to business e commerce transactions may prefer these plug and play products to our more complex offerings 
moreover  there are other very large and established companies  including microsoft  who offer alternative solutions and are thus indirect competitors 
further  dozens of companies have already supported  or have announced their intention to support jee  and may compete against us in the future 
these competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  in the powertier for c market  many potential customers build their own custom application servers  so we effectively compete against our potential customers internal information technology departments 
in the dynamai market  similar dynamic web content acceleration technology is available from a variety of sources  including but not limited to internal development  application server vendors such as oracle  electronic commerce software vendors such as intershop and atg  content delivery networks such as akamai and epicrealm  and emerging software and hardware appliance vendors such as chutney and cachier  who are directly targeting dynamai s market 
in the edgextend market  similar technology is available from a variety of sources  including the potential for internal development 
company vendors such as versant  webgain and excelon are middleware vendors that offer alternative data management solutions that directly target edgextend s market 
because we enhance standard jee application servers  we face the risk that they may develop similar functionality within their own products 
if the market for infrastructure software for networks and web based products and services does not develop as we currently envision  our business model could fail and our revenues could decline 
our performance and future success will depend on the growth and widespread adoption of the market for infrastructure software for networks and web based products and services 
if this market does not develop in the manner we currently envision  our business could be harmed 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  cost  accessibility and quality of network service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of the internet as a platform for conducting various forms of electronic commerce 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased activity or due to increased government regulation 
our failure to manage our resources could impair our business 
achieving our planned revenue targets and other financial objectives will place significant demands on our management and other resources 
our ability to manage our resources effectively will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal systems and controls  as well as our business development capabilities  and to train  motivate and manage our employees 
if we are unable to manage our resources effectively  we may not be able to retain key personnel and the quality of our services and products may suffer 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain the services of key employees 
our future success depends on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing executive personnel  especially christopher t 
keene  our chief executive officer 
we do not have a key person life insurance policy covering mr 
keene or any other officer or key employee 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales personnel and software engineers 
there is significant competition for skilled employees  especially for people who have experience in both the software and internet industries 
we have experienced significant turnover among sales personnel in recent years  which makes retention more challenging  in particular as a result of our recent restructurings 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining these skilled employees  our sales and product development efforts would suffer 
in addition  if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of that employee and any resulting loss of existing or potential customers to a competitor could harm our business 
if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
our software products may contain defects or errors  and shipments of our software may be delayed 
complex software products often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
our products have in the past contained and may in the future contain errors and defects  which may be serious or difficult to correct and which may cause delays in subsequent product releases 
delays in shipment of scheduled software releases or serious defects or errors could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation 
we may be sued by our customers for product liability claims as a result of failures in their critical business systems 
because our customers use our products for important business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
they could pursue claims for damages  which  if successful  could result in our having to make substantial payments 
although our purchase agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if meritless  would likely be time consuming and costly for us to litigate or settle 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from international sales  which could decline as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
our future success will depend  in part  on our successful development of international markets for our products 
approximately of our total revenues came from sales of products and services outside of the united states for the three months ended december   and approximately of our total revenues came from sales of products and services outside of the united states for the fiscal year we expect international revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  almost all of our international revenues have resulted from our direct sales efforts 
in international markets  however  we expect that we will depend more heavily on third party distributors to sell our products in the future 
the success of our international strategy will depend on our ability to develop and maintain productive relationships with these third parties 
the failure to develop key international markets for our products could cause a reduction in our revenues 
additional risks related to our international expansion and operation include o difficulties of staffing  funding and managing foreign operations  o future dependence on the sales efforts of third party distributors to expand business  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o failure to comply with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and changing regulations  o exposure to political instability and economic downturns  o failure to localize our products for foreign markets  o restrictions under us law on the export of technologies  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and o currency fluctuations 
the majority of our product sales outside the united states are denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations as a result of our foreign operations 
we are not currently iso compliant  nor are we attempting to meet all foreign technical standards that may apply to our products 
our failure to develop our international sales channel as planned could cause a decline in our revenues 
if we do not protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be impaired 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet the measures we are taking to protect these rights may not be adequate 
if we are not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and services  which could harm our business 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology  but these legal means afford only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we recently settled a lawsuit to protect our intellectual property rights 
further litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources 
we may be sued for patent infringement 
the software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and the violation of other intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
for example  we may be inadvertently infringing a patent of which we are unaware 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be a patent application now pending of which we are unaware  which will cause us to be infringing when it issues in the future 
to address these patent infringement claims  we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on disadvantageous commercial terms 
alternatively  we may be unable to obtain a necessary license 
a successful claim of product infringement against us  and our failure to license the infringed or similar technology  would harm our business 
in addition  any infringement claims  with or without merit  would be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and would divert management attention from administering our core business 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if our current stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  these sales of common stock could impede our ability to raise funds at an advantageous price  or at all  through the sale of securities 
as of december   we had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
virtually all of our shares  other than shares held by affiliates  are freely tradable 
in addition  shares held by affiliates are tradable  subject to the volume and other restrictions of rule our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be highly volatile  and we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations  as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and the overall volatility of the nasdaq stock market 
these fluctuations have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated because an active trading market has not developed for our stock 
thus  investors may have difficulty buying or selling shares of our common stock at a desirable price  or at all 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may rise or fall in the future as a result of many factors  such as o variations in our quarterly results  o announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  o introductions of new products by us or our competitors  o acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  o hiring or departure of key personnel  o the gain or loss of a significant customer or order  o changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  o market conditions and expectations regarding capital spending in the software industry and in our customers industries  and o adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry 
the market prices of the common stock of many companies in the software and internet industries have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
we may in the future be a target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   executive officers and directors  and entities affiliated with them  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders may  as a practical matter  continue to control the election of a majority of the directors and the determination of all corporate actions 
this concentration of voting control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or other change in control  even if it would benefit our other stockholders 
the antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests or make it more difficult for stockholders to take corporate action 
these provisions include the following o establishing a classified board in which only a portion of the total board members will be elected at each annual meeting  o authorizing the board to issue preferred stock  o prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  o limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  o prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and o establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business and dilute our stockholders 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that we believe would be advantageous to the development of our business 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any major acquisitions of third party technology  we may make acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any acquisitions  we could take any or all of the following actions  any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and the price of our common stock o issue equity securities that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership  o incur substantial debt  o assume contingent liabilities  or o take substantial charges in connection with the impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including o difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  products and personnel with our pre existing business  o unanticipated costs  o diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  o risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and o potential loss of key employees from either our preexisting business or the acquired organization 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we have not designated any specific use for the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering of common stock  and thus may use the remaining net proceeds to fund general operations  for acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
we have not designated any specific use for the net proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock 
as a result  our management and board of directors have broad discretion in spending the remaining net proceeds of that offering 
we currently expect to use the remaining net proceeds primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes  funding product development and funding our sales and marketing organization 
in addition  we may use a portion of the remaining net proceeds for further development of our product lines through acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
our operating results are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed by ten percent in  our operating results would have changed by approximately  as of december   most of our cash equivalents were invested in money market accounts and  thus  the principal values are not susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
foreign currency fluctuations 
we have certain operating transactions in foreign currencies  and maintain balances that are due or payable in foreign currencies at december  we estimate that a hypothetical ten percent change in foreign currency rates in would have impacted our financial results of operations by approximately  on a net asset basis  a hypothetical ten percent change in foreign currency rates at december  would impact our stockholders equity by approximately  we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
