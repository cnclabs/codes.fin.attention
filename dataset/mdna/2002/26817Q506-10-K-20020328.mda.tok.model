item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company that invests in a portfolio of securities and investments backed principally by single family mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans and manufactured housing installment loans 
such loans have been funded generally by the company s prior loan production operations or purchased in bulk in the market 
loans funded through the company s prior production operations have generally been pooled and pledged as collateral using a collateralized bond security structure  which provides long term financing for the loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or by application of which may have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the following are the company s critical accounting policies  excerpt from footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income is recognized when earned according to the terms of the underlying investment and when  in the opinion of management  it is collectible 
the accrual of interest on investments is discontinued or the rate on which interest is accrued is reduced at the time the collection of interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for investments that are placed on non accrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
interest on these investments is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
investments are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
fair value 
the company uses estimates in establishing fair value for its financial instruments 
estimates of fair value for financial instruments may be based on market prices provided by certain dealers 
estimates of fair value for certain other financial instruments are determined by calculating the present value of the projected cash flows of the instruments using appropriate discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions 
collateral for collateralized bonds make up a significant portion of the company s investments 
the estimate of fair value for collateral for collateralized bonds is determined by calculating the present value of the projected cash flows of the instruments  using discount rates  prepayment rate assumptions and credit loss assumptions established by management 
the discount rate used in the determination of fair value of the collateral for collateralized bonds was at december  and prepayment rate assumptions at december  and were generally at a constant prepayment rate  or cpr  ranging from for  and for  respectively  for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of single family mortgage loans  and a cpr equivalent ranging from for and for  respectively for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of manufactured housing loan collateral 
commercial mortgage loan collateral was generally assumed to repay in accordance with their contractual terms 
cpr assumptions for each year are based in part on the actual prepayment rates experienced for the prior six month period and in part on management s estimate of future prepayment activity 
the loss assumptions utilized vary for each series of collateral for collateralized bonds  depending on the collateral pledged 
the cash flows for the collateral for collateralized bonds were projected to the estimated date that the security could be called and retired by the company if there is economic value to the company in calling and retiring the security 
such call date is typically triggered on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining security balance equals of the original balance the call date 
the company estimates anticipated market prices of the underlying collateral at the call date 
the company estimated the fair value of certain other investments as the present value of expected future cash flows  less costs to service such investments  discounted at a rate of 
allowance for losses 
the company has credit risk on certain investments in its portfolio 
an allowance for losses has been estimated and established for current expected losses based on management s judgment 
the allowance for losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and projected timing and amount of probable credit losses  as well as industry loss experience 
provisions made to increase the allowance related to credit risk are presented as provision for losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company s actual credit losses may differ from those estimates used to establish the allowance

the company does not believe the adoption of fas no 
will have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources have included cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments  common stock offerings through the dividend reinvestment plan  short term warehouse lines of credit with commercial and investment banks  repurchase agreements and the capital markets via the asset backed securities market which provides long term non recourse funding of the investment portfolio via the issuance of collateralized bonds 
historically  cash flow generated from the investment portfolio has satisfied its working capital needs  and the company has had sufficient access to capital to fund its loan production operations  on both a short term prior to securitization  and recourse and long term after securitization  and non recourse basis 
however  market conditions since october have substantially reduced the company s access to capital 
the company has been unable to access short term warehouse lines of credit  and  with the exception for the re securitization of seasoned loans in its investment portfolio  has been unable to efficiently access the asset backed securities market to meet its long term funding needs 
largely as a result of its inability to access additional capital  the company sold its manufactured housing and model home purchase leaseback operations in  and ceased issuing new commitments in its commercial lending operations 
since  the company has focused on substantially reducing its recourse debt and minimizing its capital requirements 
the company has made substantial progress in both areas since  and based upon its expected investment portfolio cash flows  and anticipated proceeds from the sale and re securitization of assets  the company anticipates that it will repay all of its existing recourse debt obligations in accordance with their respective terms during the company s cash flow from its investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated collateralized bonds ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
from the cash flow on its investment portfolio  the company funds its operating overhead costs  including the servicing of its delinquent property tax receivables  and repays any remaining recourse debt 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets  the company anticipates that the cash flow from its investment portfolio will decline in versus as the investment portfolio pay downs and if interest rates  as expected  increase 
the company anticipates  however  that it will have sufficient cash flow from its investment portfolio to meet all of its obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
recourse debt at december   the company had million of recourse debt outstanding  consisting of senior notes issued in july and due july  the senior notes and a million capital lease obligation which will be fully paid in during  the company reduced its recourse debt by approximately million 
recourse debt was reduced through the use of investment portfolio cash flows and the sale of various assets of the company 
in january  the company purchased million of its senior notes  at a discount to par 
as of march   the company has approximately million in recourse debt remaining outstanding 
the company s ability to make distributions on its capital stock and to reinvest cash flow from its investment portfolio and other assets are materially restricted as a result of the amendment to the indenture governing the senior notes entered into in march and a settlement agreement entered into in october by and between the company and aca financial guaranty corporation aca as a result of an action which aca brought against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the amendment to the indenture and the settlement agreement  collectively the senior note agreements 
until the senior notes are defeased or fully repaid  the senior note agreements effectively restrict the company from making any new distributions on its capital stock  or from making any new investments  except to call securities previously issued by the company 
additional exceptions to the restrictions exist to the extent of cash proceeds of any permitted subordinated indebtedness and cash proceeds of the issuance of any qualified capital stock 
further  as a result of the senior note agreements  the company has pledged substantially all of its assets including the stock of its material subsidiaries to the indenture trustee and deposits cash in excess of a working capital balance of million into a restricted account 
the senior note agreements also require the company to call and re securitize certain of its existing collateralized bond and pass through securities by april   and if such re securitization is not completed  to sell certain other securities 
should the company fail to close the re securitization by april  and sell certain securities by may   aca has the right  at its option  to cause the sale of certain securities owned by the company pursuant to a durable power of attorney granted to it by the company 
the table below sets forth the recourse debt and recourse debt to equity ratio of the company as of december    and total recourse debt decreased from million for december  to million in and million in these decreases are the result of the company s efforts since the end of to reduce its exposure to recourse debt through the securitization or sale of assets 
total recourse debt in millions total recourse debt  net total recourse december  of issuance debt to equity ratio costs non recourse debt the company  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
collateral for collateralized bonds is not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of collateralized bonds is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   the company had billion of collateralized bonds outstanding

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
the company will rely on cash flow from its investment portfolio to fund its operations  and anticipated proceeds from the call and re securitization of securities previously issued by the company to repay the remaining outstanding senior notes due july  the company may be unable to repay such notes when due in the event of a decline in cash flow or failure to complete such re securitization 
cash flows from our portfolio are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
the company also relies on an investment bank for substantially all of the funds necessary to call securities prior to their re securitization 
the failure of such investment bank to provide such funds would make it difficult to complete the re securitization 
while the company has historically been able to sell such collateralized bonds and securities into the capital markets  the company s access to capital markets has been reduced  which may impair the company s ability to call and re securitize its existing securitizations in the future 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds by the company are fixed rate 
the company currently finances these fixed rate assets through non recourse debt  approximately million of which is variable rate 
in addition  a significant amount of the investments held by the company is adjustable rate collateral for collateralized bonds 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing have no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
in particular  the default rate and loss severity on the company s portfolio of manufactured housing loans has been higher than initially estimated 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks on loans that were delinquent as of december  third party servicers 
third party servicers service the majority of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent that these servicers are financially impaired  the performance of the company s investment portfolio may deteriorate  and defaults and credit losses may be greater than estimated 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
depository institution strategy 
the company intends to explore the formation or acquisition of a depository institution 
however  the pursuit of this strategy is subject to the outcome of the company s investigation 
no business plan has been prepared for such strategy 
therefore  any forward looking statement made in the report is subject to the outcome of a variety of factors that are unknown at this time 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market has adversely affected the company  and may continue to do so 
regulatory changes 
the company s businesses as of december  are not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools or its ability to collect on its delinquent property tax receivables 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest margin comprises the primary component of the company s earnings 
additionally  cash flow from the investment portfolio represents the primary component of the company s incoming cash flow 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
the company s strategy has been to mitigate interest rate risk through the creation of a diversified investment portfolio of high quality assets that  in the aggregate  preserves the company s capital base while generating stable income and cash flow in a variety of interest rate and prepayment environments 
the company monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the company focuses on the sensitivity of its cash flow  and measures such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its net interest margin cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming no changes in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin cash flow sensitivity analysis as of december  this analysis represents management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in the company s assets and liabilities  and there are likely to be such changes in the future 
change in net basis point interest margin cash increase decrease in flow from interest rates base case base approximately million of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the arm securities and collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates to be temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that the company has entered into such agreements 
the remaining portion of the company s investment portfolio as of december   approximately billion  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
the company has substantially limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate collateralized bonds which approximated billion as of december   and ii equity  which was million 
overall  the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates  and to the level of short term interest rates
