item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page of this annual report  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  product delays  commercialization and technology  and e s s ability to maintain credit facilities to support its operations on favorable and acceptable terms 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
reportable segments during  our business units were aggregated into the following three reportable segments the simulation group  the realimage solutions group  and the applications group 
the three groups benefit from shared core graphics technology  and each group s new products are based on open intel and microsoft hardware and software standards 
each reportable segment markets its products to a worldwide customer base 
as described above under the heading restructuring  we sold the realimage solutions group and discontinued the rapidsite business in the applications group 
financial information by reportable segment for each of the three years ended december  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this annual report 
simulation group e s is an industry leader in providing visual systems to both government and commercial simulation customers 
the simulation group provides more than of the worldwide market for government and military applications and commercial airline training simulators 
the group anticipates growth in these markets as simulation training increases in value as an alternative to other training methods  and as simulation training technology and cost effectiveness improve 
throughout  we continued development of our integrator registered trademark software product  which provides the real time control and modeling tools for the symphony tm family of hardware platforms 
performance optimizations and new functionality have continuously been added with each new software release to meet existing contract requirements and to increase the product performance 
while the majority of integrator development is complete  some additional enhancements are planned in  which management believes will expand its functionality and help secure our dominant position in our main target markets  both commercial and military 
in addition to continued development of integrator software  we completed the major development efforts on our most advanced image generator product  harmony registered trademark 
all major harmony programs are now in training or in final stages of completion and acceptance 
products markets the simulation group provides a complete line of visual systems for flight and ground training and related services to the united states and international armed forces  nasa  commercial airlines  and aerospace companies 
e s remains an industry leader in visual systems sales to many us government agencies and more than foreign governments for training military vehicle operators 
the simulation group is also a leading independent supplier of visual systems for commercial airline flight simulators 
this group provides over of the visual systems installed in full flight training simulators for commercial airlines  training centers  simulator manufacturers  and aircraft manufacturers 
the group s visual systems create high quality  interactive  out the window scenes that realistically simulate what vehicle operators see under actual operating conditions 
the visual systems are an integral part of full mission simulators  which incorporate a number of other components  including cockpits or vehicle cabs and large hydraulic motion systems 
generally  the simulation group s visual systems products consist of the six major components listed below 
these components are available as subsystems  but are typically sold together as a complete visual system solution delivered to an end user or prime contractor 
image generators igs create computer generated real time images and send these images to display devices  such as projectors or computer monitors 
the group s primary ig offerings include the symphony family of products from harmony on the high end to opengl  pc based simfusion tm at the low end  and its legacy esig registered trademark products  which continue to show strong sales 
e s offers a complete  high to low family of igs that can use the same software and databases

a full range of customer support services is offered to prime contractors  system integrators  and military or commercial end users 
service and support product offerings include customized support packages  called encore sm  that provide complete maintenance  spares  and round the clock technical support  simtech training  which provides training to the customers simulation technicians and engineers  and computer based training 
e s also develops complete simulation solutions for specific training applications 
in  we announced two new products  the mission command trainer  or mct tm  and the air traffic control trainer  or atct tm 
the mct is a low cost tactics simulator that provides realistic command training  mission planning  and mission rehearsal in a virtual environment against an intelligent virtual enemy  all in the safety and security of a classroom 
developed in a partnership with micronav  ltd  one of the world s leading producers of air traffic control training software  the atct is a complete  advanced d tower simulator for licensing  refresher training  and conversion training 
the simulation group s products are marketed worldwide by e s and qualified distributors 
products and services are sold directly to end users by e s as a prime contractor  through simulator prime contractors with e s acting as a subcontractor  and through system oems 
e s continues to form both domestic and international alliances with aerospace and simulation companies that dominate their respective market segments 
such strategic alliances have proved to be an effective method for accessing specific markets 
in addition  we have oem and value added reseller agreements with several major distributors in europe and asia 
competitive conditions primary competitive factors for the simulation group s products are performance  price  service  and product availability 
because competitors are constantly striving to improve their products  the group must ensure that it continues to offer products with the best performance at a competitive price 
prime contractors  including lockheed martin  flight safety international fsi  thales training simulation ltd  and cae electronics  ltd 
cae  offer competing visual systems in the simulation market 
we believe we are able to compete effectively in this environment and will continue to be able to do so in the foreseeable future 
in  the group was awarded several highly competitive orders against fsi and cae  the principal competitors in the commercial simulation market 
in the military simulation market  the group competes primarily with silicon graphics  inc and cae 
in the low cost  pc based market  our simfusion product competes against companies that focus on pc simulation using graphics accelerator cards  such as quantum d 
in february  a team of industry leaders led by evans sutherland was selected by the us army simulation  training  and instrumentation command stricom to receive an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity id iq contract 
under the terms of the contract  the e s team is prequalified to bid as a prime contractor on stricom contracts valued at up to billion over the next eight years 
a team comprised of e s and others is one of prime contractor teams selected by stricom for the virtual domain  one of four business domains that include constructive  live  and test instrumentation 
core members of the e s team include cubic applications  inc  caci  jf taylor  inc  raydon  and mti 
the team also includes subcontractors with extensive backgrounds in military simulation 
e s is also a member of two contractor teams selected by stricom last fall for the constructive domain 
these key contract awards position evans sutherland to provide its state of the art visual systems support  including image generation  display systems  and database development  for future stricom programs 
backlog the simulation group s backlog was million on december   compared with million on december  it is anticipated that approximately two thirds of the backlog will be converted to sales in business subject to government contract renegotiation a significant portion of the simulation group s business is dependent on contracts and subcontracts associated with government business 
the us government  and other governments  may terminate any of our government contracts and  in general  subcontracts  at their convenience as well as for default based on performance 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience  we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs 
upon termination for convenience of a fixed price type contract  we normally are entitled  to the extent of available funding  to receive the purchase price for delivered items  reimbursement for allowable costs for work in progress and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss 
upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract  we normally are entitled  to the extent of available funding  to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee 
the amount of the fee recovered  if any  is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation 
us government contracts also are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
long term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the outset of a program  the contract is usually partially funded  and congress annually determines if additional funds are to be appropriated to the contract 
realimage solutions group the realimage solutions group was sold to japan based real vision  inc  in september as part of real vision  the group is continuing to develop the studio on a chip technology  which brings together real time graphics and video in a unique and effective way to support all aspects of visual content creation for broadcasting and netcasting applications 
the sale was for a maximum value of million  consisting of cash of million plus future royalties  on a when and if earned basis  up to million for realimage technology  other assets  and the performance of certain development support during a seven month transition period leading to closing the transaction in april real vision has indicated it will continue the development of the technology  and e s is maintaining a technical staff to support real vision in salt lake city during the transition period 
shortly after the sale of the realimage group  e s closed its offices in seattle  washington  and san jose  california 
products markets prior to  the realimage solutions group developed and sold graphics chips and graphics subsystems for professional pc workstations 
early in  the group s strategic focus changed from development and manufacture of graphics accelerator cards for professional digital content creation customers to development of the next generation realimage chip  the ri this chip  referred to as studio on a chip  brings together both graphics and video processing technology on a single chip for digital video content creation and post production 
the group also began to establish a new application and market for realimage technology in when realimage chips were selected by honeywell for use in cockpit navigation systems for military aircraft and business jets 
competitive conditions due to the sale of the realimage solutions group to real vision  inc of japan  we do not compete in this industry or market any longer 
backlog because of the shift in strategic focus  the in process development of the new ri chipset  and the sale of realimage  the group has no backlog as of december   compared to million as of december  applications group the applications group is composed of synergistic businesses that use e s core technology in growth markets 
the group s products are applications that leverage e s s technology and apply them to other growth markets 
after these applications have been developed and produced  our strategy is to spin them off or sell them to companies involved in complementary businesses 
products markets the applications group s digital theater products include hardware  software  and content for both the entertainment and educational marketplaces 
digital theater focuses on immersive all dome theater applications combining colorful  digitally produced imagery  full spectrum audio  and audience participation capability 
the group provides turnkey solutions incorporating visual systems and subsystems from the simulation group

the applications group is a leading supplier of digital display systems in the planetarium marketplace 
in addition to projection and theater systems  the applications group develops and markets show content for planetariums and domed theaters 
in  the applications group achieved several important milestones 
the applications group launched its second interactive show called crack the cosmic code 
the show debuted at the starrider theater at exploration place in wichita  kansas 
the applications group continued its development of its new product  which will be launched in the first half of  as well as several new domed theater shows  which are available to theaters around the world for licensing 
in  the applications group continued to expand the market for e s rapidsite tm 
e s rapidsite is a photorealistic visualization tool designed for use by real estate developers  consulting engineers  architects  and municipal planners involved with all types of land development projects 
rapidsite features fast d model construction  accelerated graphics rendering performance and easy to use interactive exploration of a proposed development on a windows nt computer with an opengl graphics accelerator 
throughout  we had been actively seeking sale or spin off opportunities for our rapidsite tm visualization solutions business which is part of the applications group 
the general economic downturn made it difficult to sell this business 
in december  we decided to discontinue the rapidsite business 
competitive conditions primary competitive factors for the applications group s products are functionality  performance  price  and access to customers and distribution channels 
our digital theater products compete with traditional optical mechanical products and digital display systems offered by minolta planetarium co 
ltd  goto optical mfg 
co  carl zeiss inc  spitz  inc  trimension  inc and sky skan  inc 
backlog the applications group s backlog was million december   compared with million on december  it is anticipated that most of the backlog will be converted to sales in significant customers worldwide customers using e s products include us and international armed forces  nasa  aerospace companies  most major airlines  laboratories  museums  planetariums  and science centers

all of our sales to significant customers are within the simulation group 
dependence on suppliers most of our current parts and assemblies are readily available through multiple sources in the open market  however  a limited number are available only from a single source 
in these cases  we stock a substantial inventory  or obtain the agreement of the vendor to maintain adequate stock for future demands  and or attempt to develop alternative components or sources where appropriate 
on june   we entered into an electronic manufacturing services agreement with sanmina corporation now sanmina sci 
the agreement commits us to purchase a minimum of million of electronic products and assemblies from sanmina sci each year until june  if we fail to meet these minimum purchase levels  subject to adjustment  we may be required to pay percent of the difference between the million and the amount purchased 
we have fully satisfied the requirements of this contract  which ends in june various alternatives  which include a renewed contract with sanmina sci  are being evaluated 
seasonality e s believes there is no inherent seasonal pattern to its business 
sales volume fluctuates quarter to quarter due to relatively large and nonrecurring individual sales and customer established shipping dates 
intellectual property e s owns a number of patents and trademarks and is a licensee under several others 
in the us and internationally  we hold active patents that cover many aspects of our graphics technology 
several patent applications are presently pending in the us  japan  and several european countries  and other patent applications are in preparation 
e s actively pursues patents on its new technology 
e s routinely copyrights software  documentation  and chip masks designed by us and institutes copyright registration for such software  documentation  and masks when appropriate 
research development e s considers the timely development and introduction of new products to be essential to maintaining its competitive position and capitalizing on market opportunities 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were   and in   and  respectively 
we continue to fund substantially all research and development efforts internally 
it is anticipated that high levels of research and development will be needed to continue to ensure that we maintain technical excellence  leadership  and market competitiveness 
however  due to the sale of the realimage solutions group  the discontinuation of the rapidsite business and the reduction of effort required to develop our harmony and integrator products  management expects that the total research and development spending necessary to continue the timely development of products will be lower in than in international sales sales of products known to be ultimately installed outside the united states are considered international sales by e s and were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
international sales represented   and of total sales in   and  respectively

item legal proceedings lockheed martin corporation v 
evans sutherland computer corporation united states middle district court florida  case no 
cv orl c  filed on may  
on may   lockheed martin corporation served e s with a civil complaint filed in the circuit court of the ninth judicial circuit in and for orange county  florida 
lockheed alleged in the complaint that we breached a contract to provide certain visual systems for the combined arms tactical trainer program for the united kingdom ministry of defence 
the contract has an original value of million 
in the complaint  lockheed seeks compensatory damages of million plus interest as well as consequential damages and attorneys fees 
the million being sought from e s by lockheed was paid to us from may to march and was recognized as revenue by us during on june   we filed our answer and counterclaim 
in the counterclaim  we allege as grounds for recovery against lockheed breach of contract  breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  unjust enrichment  unfair competition  misappropriation of trade secrets  intentional interference with advantageous business relationship  replevin  and promissory estoppel 
in our counterclaim  we seek compensatory damages of not less than million and not more than million 
on june   the case was removed to the orlando division of the united states district court for the district of florida where it currently remains 
on july   lockheed answered our counterclaim but also filed a motion for dismissal of our counterclaims for unjust enrichment  unfair competition  promissory estoppel  and incidental damages 
on july   we filed our opposition to lockheed s motion to dismiss our counterclaims 
on october  the court denied lockheed s motion to dismiss in its entirety  without prejudice 
on january   we filed a motion for partial summary judgment  asking the court to dismiss all of lockheed s breach of contract claims 
the court denied that motion on august   citing the existence of material disputed facts 
on september  the court granted lockheed s leave to amend its complaint  which was filed on september  we filed a motion to dismiss these new claims on october   and lockheed has opposed it 
the court currently has that motion under advisement 
discovery in the matter is scheduled to conclude on september  a trial date is currently set for march  we dispute lockheed s allegations in the complaint  are vigorously defending the action  and are vigorously prosecuting our counterclaims 
although management believes e s will ultimately prevail in the litigation  an unfavorable outcome of these matters would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 
in the normal course of business  e s has various other legal claims and other contingent matters  including items raised by government contracting officers and auditors 
although the final outcome of such matters cannot be predicted  we believe the ultimate disposition of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies which are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operation and financial position 
revenue recognition revenue from long term contracts which require significant production  modification or customization is recorded using the percentage of completion method  using the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate of total anticipated costs 
our estimates of total anticipated costs include assumptions  such as estimated man hours to complete  estimated materials costs  and estimates of other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
if the actual costs are higher than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to reduce the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate was overstated 
if actual costs are lower than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to increase the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate was understated 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts billings on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and are recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheets 
as revenue recognized on these long term contracts includes estimates of management s anticipated total costs  the amounts in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts also include these estimates 
inventories inventory amounts include materials at standard costs 
inventory also includes inventoried costs on programs and long term contracts which includes direct engineering and production costs and applicable overhead  not in excess of estimated realizable value  which have not yet been recognized as cost of sales 
we periodically review inventories for excess and obsolete amounts as well as for amounts which are in excess of estimated realizable value  and provide a reserve that we consider sufficient to cover these items 
assumptions on which we estimate this reserve include future sales  pricing of future products and estimates of total anticipated costs to complete projects 
changes in any of these assumptions would result in adjustments to our operating results 
accrued expenses accrued expenses include amounts for liquidated damages and late delivery penalties on contracts on which we are late in delivering our products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have included all amounts which management believes we are liable as of december  these liquidated damages are based  in part  on our estimate of when we will complete certain projects 
to the extent delivery dates are not consistent with our estimates  these liquidated damage accruals may require additional adjustments 
we are currently a party to contracts which include further possible liquidated damages and late delivery penalties 
legal proceedings lockheed martin corporation served us with a complaint on march  alleging breach of contract and is seeking million in compensatory damages plus interest as well as consequential damages and attorneys fees 
we believe that a loss with respect to the million collected from lockheed as asserted in their legal proceedings is remote and that no amount can be currently estimated 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the appropriateness of the accounting and reflect adjustments as considered necessary 
although management believes we will ultimately prevail in the litigation  an unfavorable outcome of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as accrued liabilities  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include a corresponding adjustment within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  current economic trends and changes in our payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in any of these factors may result in material differences in the expense recognized for bad debts 
certain defense contracts a significant factor in our financial performance is six large  fixed price defense contracts which use our harmony image generator 
these six contracts represented a significant portion of our million net loss for the year we entered into these contracts between two and four years ago 
however  these six contracts are now complete and we expect to have these contracts essentially completed by year end

sales in  our total sales decreased million  or million in compared to million in 
sales in the simulation group declined million  or million in compared to million in 
sales in the realimage solutions group declined million  or million in compared to million in 
sales in the applications group declined million  or million in compared to million in 
the primary reason for the decline in sales in the simulation group is due to delays in government programs relating to our harmony image generator 
in addition  the simulation group also experienced a decline in sales volumes to its commercial airline customers 
these declines more than offset increases in the sales volumes of our simfusion pc based image generator and support services 
the decrease in the realimage solutions group declined as this group was sold during the third quarter of sales in the applications group declined due to lower sales volumes of our planetarium and large format entertainment products 
gross profit gross profit was essentially unchanged in from both million 
as a percent of sales  gross profit increased to in from in gross profit in the simulation group improved due to higher sales volumes and lower costs of sales for support services and lower costs of sales on sales to commercial airline customers 
these improvements in the simulation group were offset by lower sales to government customers and higher costs of sales on sales of simfusion pc based image generators 
the lower sales to government customers was due to delays and cost over runs on programs involving our harmony image generator 
gross profit in the applications group increased as cost of sales decreased on sales of planetarium systems and higher sales of our rapidsite real estate planning tool 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or million in compared to million in 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in these expenses decreased in the simulation group as the result of lower headcount and lower incentive bonus expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in the application group due to lower headcount  lower commissions due to lower orders  lower advertising and lower incentive bonus expense 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in is also partially due to all operating costs from april through august  of million associated with the realimage solutions group being recorded in the realimage transition costs expense category 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million including the million of costs associated with the realimage solutions group 
research and development research and development expenses decreased million  or million in compared to million in 
as a percent of sales  research and development expenses declined to in from in research and development expenses in the simulation group declined during as a result of lower labor and related expenses as the effort required on our harmony  integrator  ensemble and pc based simulation products has declined 
research and development expenses in the applications group were essentially unchanged 
the decrease in research and development expenses in is also partially due to all operating costs from april through august  associated with the realimage solutions group being recorded in the realimage transition costs expense category 
research and development expenses were million including these costs associated with the realimage solutions group 
due to the sale of the realimage solutions group  the discontinuation of the rapidsite business and the reduction of effort required to develop our harmony and integrator products  management expects that the total research and development spending necessary to continue the timely development of products will be lower in than in realimage transition costs during the second quarter of  we decided to sell the realimage solutions group 
accordingly  realimage transition costs include all the expenses associated with the realimage solutions group that were incurred in the second and third quarters of these costs totaled million and were of revenues for on august   we finalized an asset purchase and intellectual property license agreement to sell the realimage solutions group to real vision  inc of japan for a maximum value of million which is expected to close in april the consideration to e s consisted of million cash  a receivable for million which was paid in december  and future royalties payable on a when and if earned basis of up to a maximum of million 
the consideration to real vision  inc consists of realimage technology  other assets  and an obligation from e s to provide certain development support of the realimage technology during a seven month transition period concluding in april during  no comparable transition costs were incurred 
restructuring charge during  we initiated a restructuring plan focused on reducing the operating cost structure of e s 
as part of the plan  we recorded a charge of million relating to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
we estimate that this restructuring plan will reduce expenses by million per year going forward 
as of december   we had paid million in severance benefits 
the majority of the remaining benefits will be paid out over the next two quarters 
we also recognized a restructuring charge of million in and reversed million of that charge in the charge in was based on the expected costs related to the termination of employees 
the reversal of a portion of these charges in was the result of certain of these employees being transferred within e s rather than being terminated and  therefore  these termination costs were not incurred 
in addition  estimated severance and related charges were lower than expected for the terminated employees 
impairment loss we recognized an impairment loss of million in and there was no such charge in the charge was of sales 
the impairment loss related to the write off of goodwill  acquired in our acquisition of accelgraphics  inc and silicon reality  inc 
in the second quarter of gain on sale of assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of certain of our key d graphics patents 
this gain on sale of assets held for sale was of sales in and there was no such transaction in gain on sale of business unit we recognized a gain on sale of business unit of million in and million in as a percent of sales the gain was in and in the gain was the result of our sale of our realimage solutions group to real vision  inc of japan 
the sale was for a maximum value of million  consisting of cash of million plus future royalties  on a when and if earned basis  up to million  for realimage technology  other assets  and the performance of certain development support during a seven month transition period leading to closing the transaction in april the gain was the result of our sale of certain assets of our application group relating to its digital studio business to rt set real time synthesized entertainment technology ltd 
rt set and its subsidiary  rt set america inc  for million in cash  common stock of rt set and the assumption of certain liabilities 
other income expense  net other income expense  net improved by million an expense of million in compared to an expense of million in 
the loss on write down of investment securities improved million million in compared to million in 
the losses in both years are the result of other than temporary declines in the values of certain marketable investment securities of e s 
the gain on sale of investment securities declined million million in compared to million in 
the larger gain in was primarily due to the sale of our investment in silicon light machines  inc to cypress semiconductor  inc 
cypress in which we received cypress stock 
interest income was essentially zero in compared to million in interest expense increased million to million in from million in the increase in net income expense was due to lower average cash balances and higher average borrowing balances in compared to income taxes e s recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to an expense of million in income tax benefit of million for is primarily attributable to adjustments to prior year tax provisions as the result of the resolution of certain worldwide tax contingencies 
included in this amount is million for withholding taxes paid in japan for taxes associated with the realimage transaction 
during the second quarter of  we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million 
as a result of cumulative net operating losses  and the cancellation of a significant contract and the related civil complaint filed by lockheed as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we fully reserved our net deferred tax assets which previously existed at the end of the first quarter of and those deferred tax assets recognized during the second quarter of these net deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences  tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards 
the valuation allowance was recorded in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if the deferred tax assets are realized in the future  or if a portion or all of the valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  the related tax benefits will reduce future income tax provisions

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million  compared to working capital of million at december  including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash of million 
during  we used million of cash in our operating activities  generated million of cash in our investing activities and generated million of cash in our financing activities 
cash from our operating activities was provided by a million decrease in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the decrease in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was due to the achievement of billing milestones during the year and the adjustment to revenue on percent complete contracts due to the change in estimated actual costs to complete the contracts

our financing activities during the year included net borrowings of million  proceeds from issuances of common stock of million  and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
in december  we entered into a secured credit facility the foothill facility with foothill capital corporation foothill 
the foothill facility provides for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
on february   e s and foothill amended the foothill facility whereby foothill waived all events of financial covenant default through december  and revised e s s financial covenants 
the foothill facility expires in december borrowings under the foothill facility bear interest at the wells fargo bank national association prevailing prime rate plus to  depending on the amount outstanding 
the foothill facility provides foothill with a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets  including  but not limited to  all of our intellectual property 
pursuant to the terms of the foothill facility  all cash receipts of e s must be deposited into a foothill controlled account 
the foothill facility  among other things  i requires e s to maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter  a minimum unbilled receivables to billed receivables ratio  and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year  ii restricts our ability to incur debt or liens  sell  assign  pledge or lease assets  merge with another company  and iii restricts the payment of dividends and repurchase of any of our outstanding shares without the prior consent of the lender 
due to foothill s waiver on february  of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants through december  and the modification of the financial covenants  we are currently in compliance with our financial covenants and ratios  although a continuation of recent negative trends could impact future compliance with such covenants 
should the need arise  we will negotiate with foothill to modify and expand various financial ratios and covenants  however no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow us to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to us 
e s will need to replace the foothill facility on or before december  in the event e s is not able to obtain an acceptable credit facility to replace the foothill facility on or before december   e s may be unable to meet its anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
as of december   we have million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under the foothill facility 
since the end of  we have progressed against the facility  and as of march  have million in outstanding debt and million in outstanding letters of credit 
evans sutherland computer limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of evans sutherland computer corporation  has a million overdraft facility the overdraft facility with lloyds tsb bank plc lloyds 
borrowings under the overdraft facility bear interest at lloyds short term offered rate plus per annum 
as of december   there were million in outstanding borrowings 
as of march   we had fully paid off the outstanding balance 
the overdraft facility is subject to reduction or demand repayment for any reason at any time at lloyds discretion and expires on november  evans sutherland computer limited executed a letter of negative pledge in favor of lloyds whereby it agreed not to sell or encumber its assets  except in the ordinary course of business 
covenants contained in the overdraft facility restrict dividend payments from evans sutherland computer limited and require maintenance of certain financial covenants 
in addition  at december   we have million of cash on deposit with lloyds in a restricted cash collateral account to support certain obligations that the bank guarantees 
in july  we formed a joint venture with quadrant group plc known as quest flight training limited quest 
quest provides certain equipment  software  training and other goods and services to the secretary of state for defence of the uk ministry of defence and other related governmental entities with regard to an upgrade of the ministry of defence ed facility and ed sentry aircrew training services 
in connection with the services of quest to the uk ministry of defence  we guaranteed various obligations of quest 
some of our guaranteed obligations are without any maximum amount 
we believe that the guarantees we isssued in connection with this project will not be called upon for payment or performance  however  no assurance can be made that we will not be obligated to satisfy the obligations of the guarantees 
as of december   we had approximately million of convertible subordinated debentures due in the debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and are convertible at each bondholder s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of or  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
the debentures are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at par 
on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock  including the  shares still available from the repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on november  on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
between february  and december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock  leaving  shares available for repurchase as of march  we did not repurchase any shares of our stock during stock may be acquired on the open market or through negotiated transactions 
under the program  repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
the foothill facility requires that we obtain prior consent from foothill before we repurchase any shares 
we also maintain trade credit arrangements with certain of our suppliers 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the various borrowing facilities of e s or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in the event our various borrowing facilities were to become unavailable  we were unable to make timely deliveries of products pursuant to the terms of various agreements with third parties  or certain of our contracts were adversely impacted for failure to meet delivery requirements  we may be unable to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
we believe that the principal sources of liquidity for will be a result of cash flows from operations and proceeds on the sale of certain of our buildings which  subsequent to december   have been designated by management as assets to be disposed of 
positive cash flows from operations during are largely expected as a result of the restructuring which has taken place  the progress to date on our harmony image generator fixed price contracts and other cost cutting measures which will be implemented during circumstances that could materially affect liquidity in include  but are not limited to  the following i our ability to meet contractual milestones related to the delivery and integration of our harmony image generators  ii our ability to successfully develop and produce new technologies and products  iii our ability to meet our forecasted sales levels during  iv our ability to reduce costs and expenses  v our ability to maintain our commercial simulation business in light of current economic conditions and vi our ability to favorably negotiate sale agreements related to certain of our buildings 
management believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  borrowings available under our various borrowing facilities  other asset related cash sources and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
the foothill facility expires in december and the overdraft facility expires on november  we anticipate the need to replace these credit facilities  however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in renegotiating our existing borrowing facilities or obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
our cash and cash equivalents  subject to various restrictions previously set forth  are available for working capital needs  capital expenditures  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  stock repurchases and other potential cash needs as they may arise 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years  and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year acquired in process technology in connection with the acquisitions of agi and sri  we made allocations of the purchase price to various acquired in process technology projects 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges in the quarter ended june  because the acquired in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  has had a material adverse impact on e s s results of operations 
we recorded an impairment loss of million relating to the remaining balance of goodwill at the time of the sale of the realimage solutions group  in the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million consisting of a write off of million of goodwill  million of intangible assets and million of property  plant and equipment 
actual sales  operating profits and cash flows attributable to acquired in process technology have been significantly lower than the original projections used to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions 
on going operations and financial results for the acquired technology and e s as a whole are subject to a variety of factors which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such acquisitions  and the estimates discussed below should not be considered our current projections for operating results for the acquired businesses or e s as a whole 
following is a description of the acquired in process technology and the estimates made by e s for each of the technologies 
mid range professional graphics subsystem 
this technology is a graphics subsystem with built in vga core and integral dma engines 
this technology provides superior graphics performance over previous technologies  and includes features such as stereo and dual monitor support and various texture memory configurations 
the technology is used in the accelgalaxy product  which was completed and began shipping to customers in late third quarter of the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million  million over the budgeted amount and was funded by working capital 
the project was also completed a month later than scheduled 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
cad focused professional graphics subsystem 
this technology is a graphics subsystem with lower costs compared to the mid range technology  resulting in a more cost effective graphics solution for the end user 
it provides the cost sensitive user with adequate graphics performance  with few features and a single texture configuration option 
the technology is used in the e s lightning product  which was completed in march and began shipping to customers in april the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million  million over the budgeted amount and was funded by working capital 
this project was completed five months later than originally projected 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
multiple controller graphics subsystems 
this technology is a high end graphics subsystem involving the parallel use of two or four controllers 
this technology is aimed at super users in the graphics area who need significant increases in performance and features to accomplish their tasks and are willing to pay the increased price necessary to support those requirements 
during the third quarter of  we determined the technology and graphics subsystem  as originally designed  would not be a viable product in the workstation marketplace 
the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million 
the project was completed in the fourth quarter of  approximately months later than planned 
this project was funded by working capital 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
on board geometry engine graphics subsystem accelgmx 
this technology is a mid range graphics subsystem with a geometry engine on board 
this technology is aimed at the performance intensive graphics end user 
it has fewer features than the mid range professional technology  but faster geometry performance compared to the mid range professional technology on pentium ii processors 
this technology was completed in the third quarter of and the accelgmx product that uses this technology began shipping to customers at that time 
the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million and was funded by working capital 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
the accelgalaxy performed below sales estimates due to the delay in our product introduction by e s and a delayed design win at one major oem 
these delays  in addition to increased competition  caused an erosion of approximately of the projected average selling price for the accelgalaxy and a loss of projected unit sales 
subsequent to our acquisition of agi  the developer of the chip used on the accelgmx also acquired a board company and entered the graphics accelerator market in direct competition with the accelgmx 
due to the advantage of producing the chip  the competitor can produce a comparable product at a lower cost  thus  the accelgmx has performed below sales estimates and we no longer expects to generate significant sales from this product 
the e s lightning performed below sales estimates due to the delay in our product introduction 
as a result of the delay in product introduction  most oems selected a competing product 
the expected sales volume and average selling price of the e s lightning have been significantly reduced 
at the time of the sale of the realimage solutions group in the third quarter of  sales of all the group s products had decreased to nominal levels 
we periodically review the value assigned to the separate components of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets through comparison to anticipated  undiscounted cash flows from the underlying assets to assess recoverability 
the assets are considered to be impaired when the expected future undiscounted cash flows from these assets do not exceed the carrying balances of the related assets 
based on the events described above and in accordance with sfas during the third quarter of we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the acquisition of agi and sri 
the impairment loss consisted of the write off of million of goodwill  million of intangible assets and million of property  plant and equipment 
we recorded an impairment loss of million relating to the remaining value of goodwill at the time of the sale of the realimage solutions group in the third quarter of outlook is expected to be a year that returns e s to a focus on its core business 
this encompasses visualization systems  components  spares  repairs  and training for the simulation marketplace 
our focus is a function of the sale of the realimage solutions group in and closing down the rapidsite business in implicit in these changes is a consolidation of the business base 
revenues are expected to contract by from the million mark set in however  a more focused management team coupled with core product offerings is expected to revive our financial performance through higher margin business 
new core business bookings  averaging greater than gross margin  have positioned our year end backlog  of million  to support this improvement 
our main near term challenge continues to be the completion of our initial harmony programs referred to as the big programs 
we did make significant progress on these programs during our return to profitability  on a quarter by quarter basis  is dependent in large part on the successful execution of these programs in the first half of year to date  milestones are being met  a majority of first unit systems have passed testing  and several are already in training 
combined  the big programs are in excess of complete 
in looking towards the second half of the year when these programs are expected to be essentially complete  we believe that the financial posture will be much improved 
cash generation for the second half of is expected to increase to a level of million per quarter from operations and profits are expected to be produced

forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking information 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other risks described in the factors that may affect future results discussed below  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  product delays  commercialization and technology  and our ability to maintain credit facilities to support our operations on favorable and acceptable terms 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
factors that may affect future results our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving products in both price and performance 
as most market areas in which we operate continue to grow  we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
in recent years  we have been forced to adapt to domestic and worldwide political  economic  and technological developments that have strongly affected our markets 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by growing existing businesses  developing new businesses internally  selectively acquiring businesses  increasing efficiency  improving access to new markets  and reducing costs 
although our executive management team and board of directors continue to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to continue to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
our stock price may be adversely impacted if our sales or earnings fail to meet expectations our stock price is subject to significant volatility and will likely be adversely affected if sales or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations 
our sales and earnings may fail to meet expectations because they fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
our earnings during and fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
one of the reasons we experience such fluctuations is that the largest share of our sales and earnings is from our simulation group  which typically has long delivery cycles and contract lengths 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale commercial or government contracts may affect the timing and amount of sales that can be recognized  thus  causing our periodic operating results to fluctuate 
our results may further fluctuate if united states and international governments delay or even cancel production on large scale contracts due to lack of available funding 
our earnings may not meet either investor or internal expectations because our budgeted operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and even a small sales shortfall may cause a period s results to be below expectations 
such a sales shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including delays in the availability of products  delays from chip suppliers  discontinuance of key components from suppliers  other supply constraints  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  and customer demand 
another reason our earnings may not meet expectations is that our gross margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations 
these mix considerations include the mix of lower margin prime contracts versus sub contracts  the mix of new products and markets versus established products and markets  the mix of high end products versus low end products  as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
future margins may not duplicate historical margins or growth rates 
our significant debt could adversely affect our financial resources and prevent us from satisfying our debt service obligations we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or have future borrowings available to us  sufficient to pay our debt 
at december   total indebtedness was million and our total stockholders equity was million 
our ability to make debt payments or refinance our indebtedness depends on future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  management believes that available cash flow  together with available credit  will be adequate to meet our financial needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing of debt would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including  but not limited to  the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or other purposes may be impaired or unavailable  a portion of cash flow will be used to pay interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or an increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify operations  we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  our substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or in the economy generally  and some of our existing debt contains financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  acquire and dispose of assets  and pay cash dividends 
a portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
any increase in interest rates will reduce funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities and will exacerbate the consequences of our leveraged capital structure 
covenants and restrictions in our credit documents limit our ability to take certain actions our credit documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants include  among others  restrictions on our ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  incur certain additional debt  grant liens  make certain payments and investments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  and consolidate with other entities 
we must also meet certain financial ratios and tests  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter  an unbilled receivables to billed receivables ratio  and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
failure to comply with the obligations contained in the credit documents could result in an event of default  and possibly the acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing debt that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
on february   foothill agreed to waive all events of financial covenant default through december  and to revise our financial covenants 
therefore  we are currently in compliance with our financial covenants  although a continuation of recent negative operating trends could impact our future compliance with such covenants 
should the need arise  we will negotiate with our lenders to modify and expand various financial covenants  however  no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow us to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to us 
delays in the timely delivery of our products may prevent us from invoicing our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
in accordance with accounting for long term contracts  we record an asset for our costs and estimated earnings that exceed the amount we are able to bill our customers on uncompleted contracts 
at december   million of our costs and estimated earnings that exceeded our billings on uncompleted contracts related to four contracts with four different customers 
we are not able to bill these amounts unless we meet certain contractual milestones related to the delivery and integration of our harmony image generators 
our failure to achieve these contractual milestones by timely delivering and integrating our harmony image generators may significantly impact our ability to recover our costs and estimated earnings that exceeded our billings on uncompleted contracts  which could severely impact our cash flow 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our name recognition efforts and ability to compete effectively currently  we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards including trade secret protection 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to continue to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
a third party could obtain our proprietary information or develop products or technology competitive with ours 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
our significant investment in research and development may not be realized we have no assurance that our significant investment in research and development will generate future sales or benefits 
we currently make and plan to continue to make a significant investment in research and development 
total spending for research and development was million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in developing new products and software is expensive and often involves a long payback cycle 
while we have every reason to believe these investments will be rewarded with sales generating products  customer acceptance ultimately dictates the success of development and marketing efforts 
we may not continue to be successful if we are unable to develop  produce and transition our products our continued success depends on our ability to develop  produce and transition technologically complex and innovative products that meet customer needs 
we have no assurance that we will be able to successfully continue such development  production and transition 
the development of new technologies and products is increasingly complex and expensive  which among other risks  increases the risk of product introduction delays 
the introduction of a new product requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within e s as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish and the market demands 
as the variety and complexity of our product families increase  the process of planning and managing production  inventory levels  and delivery schedules also becomes increasingly complex 
there is no assurance that acceptance of and demand for our new products will not be affected by delays in this process 
additionally  if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to the penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts  and termination of our contracts 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
our short product life cycles require our ability to successfully manage the timely transition from current products to new products 
in fact  it is not unusual for us to announce a new product while its predecessor is still in the final stages of its development 
our transition results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  late release of products to manufacturing  quality or yield problems experienced by production or suppliers  variations in product costs  excess inventories of older products and components  and delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new products 
in the event we suffer further product delays  we may be required to pay certain customers substantial liquidated damages and other penalties the variety and complexity of our high technology product lines require us to deal with suppliers and subcontractors supplying highly specialized parts  operating highly sophisticated and narrow tolerance equipment in performing highly technical calculations 
the processes of planning and managing production  inventory levels and delivery schedules are also highly complex and specialized 
many of our products must be custom designed and manufactured  which is not only complicated and expensive  but can also require a number of months to accomplish 
slight errors in design  planning and managing production  inventory levels  delivery schedules  or manufacturing can result in unsatisfactory products that may not be correctable 
if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we accrued million for payments of liquidated damages and penalties due to product delays 
as of december   we have paid million in connection with liquidated damages 
during  we accrued an additional million for late delivery penalties 
during we accrued million to cover penalties  against which we paid million 
in  we also accrued million to cover additional costs incurred by customers 
there is no assurance that we may not incur substantial liquidated damages in the future in connection with further product delays 
we may not maintain a significant portion of our sales if we fail to maintain our united states government contracts in  of our sales were to agencies of the united states government  either directly or through prime contractors or subcontractors  for which there is intense competition 
accordingly  we have no assurance that we will be able to maintain a significant portion of our sales 
these sales are subject to the inherent risks related to government contracts  including uncertainty of economic conditions  changes in government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments  and unavailability of funds 
these risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and dependence on annual congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in the past  some of our programs have been delayed  curtailed  or terminated 
although we cannot predict such uncertainties  in our opinion there are no spending reductions or funding limitations pending that would impact our contracts 
other characteristics of the government contract market that may affect our operating results include the complexity of designs  the difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work  and the speed with which product lines become obsolete due to technological advances and other factors characteristic of the market 
our earnings may vary materially on some contracts depending upon the types of government long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  and the achievement of other performance objectives 
furthermore  due to the intense competition for available united states government business  maintaining or expanding government business increasingly requires us to commit additional working capital for long term programs and additional investments in company funded research and development 
our dependence on government contracts may lead to other perils as well because as a united states government contractor or sub contractor  our contracts and operations are subject to government oversight 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of our contract performance and cost accounting 
these investigations may lead to claims against e s 
under united states government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts  a conviction could result in debarment for a specified period of time 
our sales may suffer if we lose certain significant customers we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on four of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
our sales will decrease if we fail to maintain our international business any reduction of our international business could significantly affect our sales 
our international business accounted for of our sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our overall business in the foreseeable future 
our international business experiences many of the same risks our domestic business encounters as well as additional risks such as exposure to currency fluctuations and changes in foreign economic and political environments 
despite our exposure to currency fluctuations  we are not engaged in any material hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from stringent contractual terms and conditions and widely differing legal systems  customs  and standards in foreign countries 
in addition  our international sales often include sales to various foreign government armed forces  with many of the same inherent risks associated with united states government sales identified previously 
future losses could impair our ability to raise capital or borrow money and consequently affect our stock price although we recorded net sales of million for the twelve months ended december   we incurred a net loss of million in we have incurred net losses totaling million over the past four years 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in future periods 
losses in future periods could impair our ability to raise additional capital or borrow money as needed  could decrease our stock price and could cause a violation of certain covenants in our credit facilities 
if our commercial simulation business declines  our sales will decrease we have no assurance that our commercial simulation airline business will continue to succeed 
our commercial simulation business currently accounts for approximately to of our sales 
this business is subject to many of the risks related to the commercial simulation market that may adversely affect our business 
the following risks are characteristic of the commercial simulation market uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence upon the strength of the commercial airline industry  air pilot training requirements  competition  changes in technology  and timely performance by subcontractors on contracts in which e s is the prime contractor 
we may make acquisitions that are unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources from more profitable operations we intend to consider acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counterparties 
also  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to complete any such transaction or consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions  our operating expenses may increase 
this increase would affect our net earnings  which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
these transactions involve numerous other risks as well  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operations could be hurt by terrorist attacks and other activities that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of our commercial airline customers to purchase our simulation products 
during  million  or of our total revenue generated from our simulation group  was derived from sales of our simulation products to commercial airline companies and other third parties in the commercial airline industry 
the demand for our various commercial simulation products and services is heavily dependant upon new orders from these commercial airline customers 
in the event terrorist attacks or other activities make air travel difficult or reduce the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our commercial simulation products  our revenue may decline substantially 
since september   training requirements have increased to certify pilots  co pilots and flight engineers for different aircraft types and changing flight procedures 
in conjunction with this trend  the simulation group has been contacted by one of our largest commercial customers to deliver two times the average annual number of systems 
in addition to these additional systems  the contract provides for an option to deliver further systems in however  at this time  we are unable to predict the long term impact of these events on either our industry as a whole or on our operations and financial condition in particular 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
our international sales  which accounted for of our total sales in are concentrated in the united kingdom  continental europe and asia 
foreign currency purchase and sale contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged contracts 
as of december   we had no material sales or purchase contracts in currencies other than us dollars and had no foreign currency sales or purchase contracts 
we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by maintaining a high proportion of our debt in fixed rate instruments 
as of december   of our total debt was in fixed rate instruments 
had we fully drawn on our million revolving line of credit with foothill capital corporation and our foreign line of credit  of our total debt would be in fixed rate instruments
