accordingly  it is reasonably possible that total costs to be incurred on any of the projects in process at march  could be materially different from management s estimates  and any modification of management s estimate of total project costs to be incurred could result in material changes in the profitability of affected projects or result in material losses and affected projects 
discontinued operations  assets held for sale discontinued operations include management s best estimate of the amount to be realized on the sale of its contract gear manufacturing divisions assets  consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment  which have been estimated based on an independent appraisal

management s best estimate of the realizable sales value of the company s gear manufacturing equipment could be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions  changing valuations in the resale market for gear manufacturing equipment and a variety of other factors and future occurrences 
management s best estimate of the future losses during the winding down of gear manufacturing operations could be adversely impacted by labor disruptions  employee resignations  lower than expected labor productivity  customer order cancellations and a variety of other factors and future occurrences 
accordingly  the amount the company will ultimately receive from the sale of these assets  and the level of losses incurred during the winding down of gear operations  could differ materially from the amounts estimated
