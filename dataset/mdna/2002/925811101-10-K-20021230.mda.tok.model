at september  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the company also maintains a bank overdraft facility of million pounds sterling approximately  in the uk to support local working capital requirements of vicon industries limited

the company believes that it has sufficient cash to meet its anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company has experienced reduced sales levels and incurred operating losses in recent periods which  if continued  could limit the company s ability to draw upon its bank credit facilities if needed 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
as it relates to product sales  revenue including shipping and handling fees is generally recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer 
under arrangements that involve the sale of product combined with the provision of services  revenue is generally recognized for each element of the arrangement upon delivery or performance provided that i the undelivered element is not essential to the functionality of the delivered element and ii there is objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
advance service billings under a national supply contract with one customer are deferred and recognized as revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from its estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
technology changes and market conditions may render some of the company s products obsolete and additional inventory write downs may be required 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company s ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
the company has incurred operating losses in the past two fiscal years 
should such losses continue in the future  the company may determine that it is not likely it will be able to realize the benefits of recorded deferred tax assets  and a valuation allowance will need to be established that would result in the charge off of previously reported tax benefits 
as further described in note  the company has not yet adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of september  and determined its possible effects on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company continued to amortize its recorded goodwill over its original year period as of september  and also evaluated impairment through that same period using undiscounted cash flows 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but  instead  tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of the statement 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  as discussed below 
the company adopted sfas no 
on october  and is required to assign its goodwill million at september   which relates to its acquisition of telesite usa  inc in to reporting units as defined under sfas no 
goodwill assigned to each of the reporting units will be tested for impairment as of october  by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets including goodwill to its fair value 
the company has six months from october  to complete this first step of this transitional goodwill impairment test 
if the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  a second step of the transitional goodwill impairment test must be completed as soon as possible  but not later than september  due to the complexities involved with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the possible effects of its adoption of sfas no 
on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is reasonably possible that the adoption of sfas no 
will result in an impairment charge to goodwill of up to million  which would be reported as a cumulative effect change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill will be evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 as discussed above 
the company adopted sfas no 
on october   which did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the company believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized its tentative consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is currently analyzing the impact of its adoption on the company s financial statements 
foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the british pound sterling  the euro  the israeli shekel and the japanese yen 
sales by the company s uk based subsidiary to customers in europe and the middle east are made in british pounds sterling pounds or eurodollars euros 
in fiscal  approximately million of products were sold by the company to its uk based subsidiary for resale 
in past years  the pound and the euro have weakened against the us dollar  thus increasing the cost of us sourced product sold by this subsidiary 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on intercompany sales through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
the company s israeli based subsidiary incurs shekel based operating expenses which  in recent years  have been funded by the company in us dollars 
in the recent year  the company purchased forward exchange contracts to minimize its currency exposure on these expenses 
japanese sourced products denominated in japanese yen accounted for approximately and of component and finished product purchases in fiscal and  respectively 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on these purchases through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
as of september   the company had interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively  whose aggregate fair value was a liability of approximately  in general  the company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate short term exchange rate exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting long term foreign currency exposure 
market risk factors the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has a policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency activity  note derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments to the accompanying financial statements 
at september   the company s foreign currency exchange risks included a million intercompany accounts receivable balance due from the company s uk based subsidiary and a nominal japanese yen denominated trade accounts payable liability due to inventory suppliers 
such assets and liabilities are short term and will be settled in fiscal the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at september   a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound would result in a  decrease or increase  respectively  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance 
such foreign currency exchange risk at september  has been substantially hedged by forward exchange contracts 
at september   the company had million of outstanding floating rate bank debt which was covered by interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the foregoing floating rate debt to stated fixed rates see note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
thus  the company has substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments 
however  the company had approximately  of floating rate bank debt that is subject to interest rate risk as it was not covered by interest rate swap agreements 
the company does not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
related party transactions refer to item and note related party transactions to the accompanying financial statements 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has been minimal in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low 
however  inflation continues to increase costs to the company 
as operating expenses and production costs increase  the company seeks price increases to its customers to the extent permitted by market conditions
