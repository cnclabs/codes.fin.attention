item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have principally focused our efforts and resources on research and development of cell transplantation technology for treating human diseases that are characterized by cell dysfunction or cell death and for which current therapies are either inadequate or nonexistent 
our primary source of working capital to fund those activities has been proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities 
in addition  since october   we have received funding from our joint venture with genzyme in support of the joint venture s product development programs 
we have not received any revenues from the sale of products to date and do not expect to generate product revenues for the next several years 
we have experienced fluctuating operating losses since inception and expect that the additional activities required to develop and commercialize our products will result in increasing operating losses for the next several years 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in  we formed a joint venture with genzyme to develop and commercialize the joint venture s product candidates 
we are currently responsible for funding of the development and commercialization costs of the joint venture and will share all costs in excess of million equally with genzyme 
as of december   approximately million had been contributed to the joint venture by genzyme and approximately million had been contributed by us 
genzyme s president and chief executive officer is a director of the company 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of our audited financial statements which are included in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those that dictate how we recognize revenue and expense related to the joint venture s activity 
we record as research and development expense all costs related to the joint venture s product candidates incurred by us on behalf of the joint venture 
we then recognize research and development revenue equal to the amount of reimbursement received by us from the joint venture out of funds contributed by genzyme 
we do not recognize research and development revenue for amounts we receive from the joint venture out of funds contributed by us 
as genzyme incurs costs on behalf of the joint venture that we are obligated to fund  we recognize an expense in our statement of operations captioned equity in operations of joint venture 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  research and development revenues were approximately  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  revenues for both years were comprised entirely of revenue from the joint venture 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of a decrease in clinical production activity related to our joint venture with genzyme 
investment income of million for the years ended december  and remained relatively unchanged 
we expect our investment income in will decrease due to a drop in interest rates 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the costs associated with sponsoring and managing our clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to an executive retention plan and an increase in professional fees incurred as we evaluated strategic relationships 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in was due to the scheduled pay down of lease and loan debt outstanding 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  charge related to our equity in the operations of the joint venture compared to a million charge for the year ended december  this expense related to funds contributed by us to the joint venture that were used to fund expenses incurred by genzyme on behalf of the joint venture 
the decreased charge in was primarily due to a decrease in clinical activity performed by genzyme on behalf of the joint venture 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  versus a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  year ended december  versus year ended december  research and development revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  revenues for both years were comprised entirely of revenue from the joint venture 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of a decrease in clinical production activity related to our joint venture with genzyme 
the joint venture completed accruing patients into its phase clinical trial for neurocell pd in investment income was million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase in was due to greater cash balances available for investment in as a result of our public stock offering completed in march research and development expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   remained relatively unchanged between the periods 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   remained relatively unchanged between the periods 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in was due to the scheduled pay down of lease and loan debt outstanding 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million charge related to our equity in the operations of the joint venture compared to a million charge for the year ended december  this expense related to funds contributed by us to the joint venture that were used to fund expenses incurred by genzyme on behalf of the joint venture 
the decreased charge in was primarily due to a decrease in clinical activity performed by genzyme on behalf of the joint venture as the joint venture completed recruiting patients into it phase clinical trial in we incurred a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  versus a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our activities primarily with the net proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities aggregating million and with interest earned thereon 
in addition  we have recorded approximately million in revenue from our joint venture since it commenced on october  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments aggregating approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash used in operations for the years ended december   and was primarily attributable to our net loss  offset in part by our equity in operations of the joint venture 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to a decrease in long term investments offset by an increase in short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in short term investments and long term investments 
the increase in investments was due to our public offering of common stock in march net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease in short term investments and the return of capital for services provided on behalf of our joint venture  offset in part by our investment in our joint venture 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to principal payments made towards long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a public offering in march net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to principal payments made towards long term debt 
in november  we borrowed  at the prime rate plus at december  under an unsecured five year term loan with a bank to finance our biomedical animal facility acquired during as of december   we owed  under this term loan 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  in october  we exercised the first of two options we have to extend the lease of a facility an additonal five years 
during the extension period  which began in october  we will pay annual rent of approximately  we believe that our existing funds will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development  the scope and results of preclinical and clinical testing  any termination of the joint venture  relationships with future strategic partners  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the fda s regulatory process  the market acceptance of any approved products and other factors 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  expanding our cell production capabilities and the expansion of our laboratory and administrative activities 
therefore  in order to achieve commercialization of our potential products  we may need substantial additional funds 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we may require on acceptable terms  if at all 
diacrin genzyme llc financial statements for the year ended december   our equity in operations of the joint venture exceeded of our net loss 
accordingly  pursuant to the rules of the securities and exchange commission  our prior year annual report on form k included separate audited financial statements for the joint venture 
for the year ended december   our equity in operations of the joint venture did not exceed of our net loss 
as a result  the current year financial information with respect to the joint venture presented in this annual report on form k is unaudited 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this statement provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
in addition  it requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
as of january  and  based on current circumstances  we do not expect the adoption of the statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k represent our expectations as of march   the date our annual report on form k was filed with the sec 
subsequent events will cause our expectations to change 
however  while we may elect to update these forward looking statements  we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to our business  industry and strategy we have not successfully commercialized any products to date and  if we do not successfully commercialize any products  we will not be profitable neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market the types of products we are developing 
the products that we are developing will require additional research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sale 
our product candidates are currently in early phase clinical trials or in the preclinical stage of development 
our products may not be effective in treating any of our targeted disorders or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
we currently have no products for sale and do not expect to have any products available for sale for several years 
if we are not successful in developing and commercializing any products  we will never become profitable 
the evaluation of the unblinded data from our phase clinical trial of neurocell pd may not support further development in march  we unblinded our phase clinical trial of neurocell pd and announced a preliminary analysis of the results 
we did not see a statistically significant difference between the treated patients and the patients in the control group and  therefore  did not meet the primary endpoint in the trial 
while we are still evaluating the data from this clinical trial  it is possible that further clinical development of neurocell pd by the joint venture will not be supported by genzyme  or that we may choose to discontinue development or modify the clinical trial protocols  which could result in the termination of or significant delay in the progress of the neurocell pd development program or the termination of the joint venture 
our cell transplantation technology is complex and novel and there are uncertainties as to its effectiveness we have concentrated our efforts and therapeutic product research on cell transplantation technology  and our future success depends on the successful development of this technology 
our principal approach is based upon xenotransplantation  or the transplantation of cells  tissues or organs from one species to another 
our product candidates generally involve the transplantation of porcine pig neural cells into humans 
xenotransplantation is an emerging technology with limited clinical experience 
neither the fda nor any foreign regulatory body has approved any xenotransplantation based therapeutic product for humans 
our technological approaches may not enable us to successfully develop and commercialize any products 
if our approaches are not successful  we may be required to change the scope and direction of our product development activities 
in that case  we may not be able to identify and implement successfully an alternative product development strategy 
xenotransplantation involves risks which have resulted in additional fda oversight and which in the future may result in additional regulation xenotransplantation poses a risk that viruses or other animal pathogens may be unintentionally transmitted to a human patient 
the fda requires us to perform tests to determine whether infectious agents  including porcine endogenous retroviruses  referred to as perv  are present in patients who have received porcine cells 
while perv has not been shown to cause any disease in pigs  it is not known what effect  if any  perv may have on humans 
we have performed tests on patients who have received our porcine cells 
no perv has been detected to date  but we cannot assure you that we will not detect perv or another infectious agent in the future 
the fda requires lifelong monitoring of porcine cell transplant recipients 
if perv or any other virus or infectious agent is detected in tests or samples  the fda may require us to halt our clinical trials and perform additional tests to assess the risk to patients of infection 
this could result in additional costs to us and delays in the trials of our porcine cell products 
furthermore  even if patients who have received our porcine cells remain perv free  we could be adversely affected if perv is detected in patients who receive porcine cells provided by others 
in january  the fda issued definitive regulatory guidelines for xenotransplantation titled phs guideline on infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these guidelines 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do the products we are developing compete with existing and new products being developed by pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have 
efforts by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies could render our products uneconomical or result in therapies for the disorders we are targeting that are superior to any therapy we develop 
furthermore  many of our competitors are more experienced in product development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing 
as a result  they may develop competing products more rapidly and at a lower cost 
these competitors may discover  develop and commercialize products which render non competitive or obsolete the products that we are seeking to develop and commercialize 
if the market is not receptive to our products upon introduction  our products may not achieve commercial success the commercial success of any of our products will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community and third party payors 
among the factors that we believe will materially affect acceptance of our products are the timing of receipt of marketing approvals and the countries in which those approvals are obtained  the safety and efficacy of our products  the need for surgical administration of our products  problems encountered in the field of xenotransplantation  the success of physician education programs  the cost of our products which may be higher than conventional therapeutic products because our products involve surgical transplantation of living cells  and the availability of government and third party payor reimbursement of our products 
risks relating to clinical and regulatory matters if our clinical trials are not successful for any reason  we will not be able to develop and commercialize any related products in order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates  we will be required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the products 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials 
the submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  may not result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
if clinical trials begin  we may not complete testing successfully within any specific time period  if at all  with respect to any of our product candidates 
furthermore  we or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
clinical trials  if completed  may not show any potential product to be safe or effective 
thus  the fda and other regulatory authorities may not approve any of our product candidates for any disease indication 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials and the availability of alternative treatments 
in particular  the patient population for some of our potential products is small 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and program delays 
we rely on third party clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials 
as a result  we may encounter delays outside of our control 
we may not be able to reinitiate a clinical trial that has been suspended by the fda clinical trials are subject to ongoing review by the fda 
the fda has the authority to suspend a clinical trial for various reasons  as they did in april with respect to our clinical trial using porcine neural cells to treat stroke patients 
because our products are novel and complex  getting the fda to lift a suspension could result in significant program delays and additional costs to us 
it is possible that we may not be able to obtain permission from the fda to continue a clinical trial that has been suspended 
cost increases and ongoing delays as a result of an fda suspension could result in our decision to postpone pursuing certain product candidates 
the regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and we may not be able to successfully obtain all required regulatory approvals we must obtain regulatory approval for each of our product candidates before we can market or sell it 
we may not receive regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials of our products or to manufacture or market our products 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not grant approvals on a timely basis or may revoke previously granted approvals 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to generate product revenue 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive 
the time required for fda and other clearances or approvals is uncertain and typically takes a number of years  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
we have only limited experience in filing and prosecuting applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals 
our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product 
these limitations may limit the size of the market for the product 
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the design and conduct of the clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of our future products 
the approval procedure varies among countries 
the time required to obtain foreign approvals often differs from that required to obtain fda approvals 
moreover  approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries 
even if we obtain marketing approval  our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight which may affect the success of our products any regulatory approvals that we receive for a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing follow up studies 
after we obtain marketing approval for any product  the manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities for that product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  such as the presence of perv  or with the manufacturer or facility  may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
risks relating to financing our business we have incurred substantial losses  we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never achieve profitability we have incurred losses in each year since our founding in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have no material sources of revenue from product sales or license fees 
we anticipate that it will be a number of years  if ever  before we develop significant revenue sources or become profitable  even if we are able to commercialize products 
we expect to increase our spending significantly as we continue to expand our research and development programs  expand our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals and begin commercialization activities 
in particular  we may devote significant economic resources to funding our joint venture with genzyme and to its product development plans 
under the joint venture agreement  we are currently required to provide of the funding required for the development and commercialization of neurocell pd and neurocell hd and in the future will be required to provide of the required funding 
we may require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain and may dilute your ownership interest we will require substantial funds to conduct research and development  including clinical trials of our product candidates  and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the analysis of the data from the phase clinical trial of neurocell pd which could result in the termination of our joint venture with genzyme  continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the resources required to successfully complete our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities  the cost of any additional facilities requirements  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments from future collaborative partners  the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties from our potential products in the market  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the costs of obtaining any required licenses to technologies 
we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities further dilution to our then existing stockholders may result 
in addition  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue independently 
risks relating to intellectual property we may not be able to obtain patent protection for our discoveries and we may infringe patent rights of others the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual issues 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
patents may not issue from any patent applications that we own or license 
if patents do issue  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states may be maintained in secrecy until patents issue  others may have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents related to our proposed products 
in some cases  others may own or control these patents 
as a result  we or our collaborative partners may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market some of our proposed products 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we will not be able to market these affected products 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology  information  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors as well as through other security measures 
these confidentiality agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding the complex patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
the types of situations in which we may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings include we may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights  we may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by these third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or services do not infringe the third parties patents  if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  we may participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention  and if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights  we will need to defend against such claims 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
if a patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding is resolved unfavorably to us  we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products and services without a license from the other party and be held liable for significant damages 
we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
if we breach any of the agreements under which we license technology from others we could lose license rights that are important to our business we are a party to technology in licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future 
in particular  our immunomodulation technology and some of our product candidates are covered by patents licensed from massachusetts general hospital 
these licenses impose commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  the licensor will have the right to terminate the license 
risks relating to product manufacturing  marketing and sales since we have no sales and marketing experience or infrastructure  we must rely on third parties we have no sales  marketing and distribution experience or infrastructure 
we plan to rely significantly on sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties for the products that we are developing 
for example  under our joint venture agreement  we have granted to genzyme on behalf of the joint venture exclusive worldwide marketing rights to neurocell pd and neurocell hd 
we may have limited or no control over the sales  marketing and distribution activities of genzyme  the joint venture or any future collaborative partners 
our future revenues will be materially dependent upon the success of the efforts of these third parties 
if in the future we determine to perform sales  marketing and distribution functions ourselves  we would face a number of additional risks  including we may not be able to attract and build a significant marketing or sales force  the cost of establishing a marketing or sales force may not be justifiable in light of any product revenues  and our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful 
delays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and disruptions in our manufacturing process may delay or disrupt our commercialization efforts before we can begin commercially manufacturing our product candidates  we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and process 
manufacturing of our product candidates must comply with cgmp  and foreign regulatory requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures 
in complying with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements  we will be obligated to expend time  money and effort on production  recordkeeping and quality control to ensure that our product candidates meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our product candidates 
we are the only manufacturers of our product candidates 
for the next several years  we expect that we will conduct all of our manufacturing in our facility in charlestown  massachusetts 
if this facility or the equipment in this facility is significantly damaged or destroyed  we will not be able to replace quickly or inexpensively our manufacturing capacity 
we have no experience manufacturing our product candidates in the volumes that will be necessary to support large clinical trials or commercial sales 
our present manufacturing process may not meet our initial expectations as to scheduling  reproducibility  yield  purity  cost  potency or quality 
the manufacture of our products would be delayed by disruptions in our supply of porcine tissue the manufacture of our products requires the continuous availability of porcine tissue harvested from pigs tested to be free of infectious agents and quarantined in a qualified animal facility 
our main sources of these facilities and services are tufts university school of veterinary medicine and pharmservices  inc  a division of charles river laboratories  inc 
a disease epidemic or other catastrophe in either of these facilities could destroy all or a portion of our pig supply  which would interrupt or significantly delay the research  development and commercialization of our products 
risks related to ongoing operations if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our future products by third party payors  there may be no commercially viable markets for our products our products may be more expensive than conventional treatments because they involve the surgical transplantation of living cells 
the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for medical products 
in some foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
in both the united states and some foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system 
further proposals are likely 
the potential for adoption of these proposals may affect our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborative partners and market our products 
if we obtain marketing approval for our products  we expect to experience pricing pressure due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals 
we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs or otherwise to protect us against potential product liability claims we may be subjected to product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human health care products 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our products 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
product liability insurance is generally expensive for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours 
although we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for the clinical trials of our products  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain further product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  and that our present insurance levels and any insurance we subsequently obtain will not provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants our success depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel for the research and development activities we conduct or sponsor 
if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management or other key employees or consultants  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as regulatory compliance  manufacturing and marketing  will require the addition of new management personnel 
the pool of personnel with the skills that we require is limited 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate such additional personnel 
risks relating to our common stock our officers and directors may be able to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval our directors and officers and entities with which they are affiliated control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
due to this concentration of ownership  this group may be able to prevail on all matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors  the amendment of our organizational documents  or the approval of a merger  sale of assets or other major corporate transaction 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment the market price of our common stock  like that of the common stock of many other development stage biotechnology companies  may be highly volatile 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
prices for our common stock will be determined in the market place and may be influenced by many factors  including variations in our financial results and investors perceptions of us  changes in recommendations by securities analysts as well as their perceptions of general economic  industry and market conditions 
we have antitakeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval upon such terms as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
for example  if the interest rate on our interest bearing investments were to change  investment income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by approximately  in this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or our response to such hypothetical conditions 
our investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
