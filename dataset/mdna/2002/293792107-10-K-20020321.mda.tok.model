item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein as well as the other portions of this report on form k 
in addition  the reader should review cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors beginning on page of this report for information regarding forward looking statements made in this discussion and certain risks inherent in our business 
other risks involved in our business are discussed under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks beginning on page of this report 
additionally  please see part iii  item for a discussion of related party issues such as the epco agreement and our relationship with shell 
general during the last three years  we have completed or initiated several acquisitions and investments having a combined value of over billion 
these include million in natural gas processing and ngl businesses  million in natural gas and other pipeline businesses and million in propylene fractionation and ngl petrochemical storage assets 
specifically  we have completed the following acquisitions and asset purchases 
million paid to acquire tngl s natural gas processing and ngl businesses  
million paid to acquire an additional interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility  
million paid to acquire the lou tex propylene pipeline  
million paid to acquire the acadian gas natural gas pipeline network  
million invested in four gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems  
million paid to purchase storage assets in mont belvieu initiated  completed january  and 
million paid to purchase a controlling interest in a propylene fractionation facility and related assets in mont belvieu initiated  completed february 
during  we issued the last installment of million special units to shell valued at approximately million 
these new special units were issued in connection with the tngl acquisition that was completed in  resulting in a final total purchase price of million 
we entered the natural gas pipeline business in by completing the acquisition of acadian gas and investments in four gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems 
in april  we acquired acadian gas an onshore louisiana system from an affiliate of shell for million using proceeds from the issuance of public debt 
acadian gas and its affiliates are involved in the purchase  sale  transportation and storage of natural gas in louisiana 
its assets include  miles of natural gas pipelines and a leased natural gas storage facility 
in january  we paid el paso million for equity interests in four gulf of mexico offshore louisiana natural gas pipeline systems 
these systems are comprised of miles of regulated and non regulated natural gas pipelines 
the acquisition of these businesses represent strategic investments for the company 
we believe that these assets have attractive growth attributes given the expected long term increase in natural gas demand for industrial and power generation uses 
in addition  these assets extend our midstream energy service relationship with long term ngl customers producers  petrochemical suppliers and refineries 
these assets also provide opportunities for enhanced services to customers and generate additional fee based cash flows 
developments 
in january  we completed the acquisition of diamond koch s d k mont belvieu storage assets from affiliates of valero energy corporation and koch industries  inc for million 
these facilities include storage wells with a useable capacity of mmbbls and allow for the storage of mixed ngls  ethane  propane  butanes  natural gasoline and olefins such as ethylene  polymer grade propylene  chemical grade propylene and refinery grade propylene 
with the inclusion of the former d k facilities  we own and operate mmbbls of storage capacity at mont belvieu  one of the largest such facilities in the world 
in addition  we completed the purchase of d k s interest in a propylene fractionation facility and related assets in february at a cost of approximately million 
including this purchase  we effectively own mbpd of net propylene fractionation capacity in mont belvieu and have access to additional customers at this key industry hub 
our outlook for first half of the year was an economically challenging period for the ngl and petrochemical industries 
the domestic ngl industry was adversely affected by abnormally high natural gas prices during the first quarter of resulting in a substantial reduction in ngl extraction rates at virtually all gas processing plants industry wide 
as natural gas prices moderated during the remainder of  industry wide extraction rates returned to normalized levels resulting in increased volumes and profitability across many of our business operations 
our outlook for the first half of is more favorable than what we experienced during the first half of overall  we expect ngl extraction rates for the gas processing industry to continue near the levels sustained during the fourth quarter of due to stabilized processing margins 
should this forecast be realized  our equity ngl production rate would approximate to mbpd during the first half of as compared to mbpd during the same period in our outlook is based on the market price of natural gas remaining within the historical norm in terms of its relative value to other forms of energy 
after peaking at near per mmbtu in january  natural gas prices decreased to near per mmbtu during the fourth quarter of which is within the historical norm 
the forecasted market price of natural gas for the first half of should continue to make it economically attractive to recover ngls at higher levels even though downstream demand has been reduced due to the downturn in the world economy 
barring any major disruptions  industry expectations are that natural gas market prices will remain stable for the first half of due to strong supply 
drilling activity in the gulf of mexico increased significantly in early in response to the abnormally high price of natural gas during that period 
with the moderation in energy prices over the last half of  drilling activity began to decline continuing into early 
over time  however  we expect that the improving domestic economy and new gas fired electric generation facilities will increase demand for natural gas and thus strengthen the price and stimulate increased drilling 
as drilling increases  we expect our gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems to benefit  however  if drilling activity continues to be suppressed over the longer term  these investments could be adversely affected by reduced volumes 
we expect acadian gas to benefit from two new gas fired cogeneration facilities commencing operations during  one of which should begin operations during the second quarter of this will help to offset lower pipeline throughput volumes expected in the first five months of caused by a seasonal decrease in natural gas demand due to warmer weather 
by the end of the second quarter of  pipeline throughput volumes should rise due to an increase in gas consumption by electricity providers as a result of the beginning of summer air conditioning demands 
we expect that utilization of our lou tex ngl pipeline will be higher during the first half of as a result of additional pipeline throughput volumes primarily propane and butane coming from louisiana locations and a continuation of raw make production volumes being moved from the sea robin gas processing facility to mont belvieu 
due to a mild winter in the continental us  we are capturing additional revenue from transporting propane on this system out of louisiana to mont belvieu for export to overseas markets 
the relatively warm winter in the southeastern us has also adversely affected propane shipments on the dixie pipeline system  therefore  some of their propane shipments are being diverted to mont belvieu for storage  export  petrochemical and other uses 
as a result of these increased propane exports  we project that epik will have a full loading schedule extending early into the second quarter of export activity will decline during the summer months when demand for propane for heating is reduced 
our import terminal is expected to have a typical first quarter as imports are historically low during this period and looks to be no exception 
however  we expect that the second quarter of will provide opportunities for importing cargoes of mixed butane and anticipate that the unloading facility will be heavily utilized 
the hsc pipeline should benefit from an increase in exports during the first quarter and an increase in imports during the second quarter 
we may also see an increase in pipeline shipments of propane propylene mix due to the purchase of the d k propylene fractionator 
lastly  throughput volumes on the tri states  wilprise and belle rose systems are expected to average mbpd during the first half of compared to mbpd during the first half of the lower rate in was due to lower ngl extraction rates by gas processing facilities 
we expect continued strong demand for our hydrocarbon storage services due to the continued recovery of ngls by gas processing facilities 
with the purchase of d k s mont belvieu storage assets  we will be offering additional opportunities to customers during in the form of expanded services  options  and flexibility for the delivery and or consumption of their ngls 
these additional services should provide additional margins as we integrate the former d k assets with our existing mont belvieu operations 
ngl fractionation services at mont belvieu will remain competitive due to excess ngl fractionation capacity at this industry hub 
to offset lower fractionation tolling fees  we have increased feed rates at our mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility over the last year with the addition of newly contracted volumes such as the mixed ngl stream coming from the sea robin gas processing plant in louisiana via the lou tex ngl pipeline 
during the first quarter of  our isomerization business has benefited from increased refinery demand for isobutane 
the market price spread between normal butane and isobutane during the first quarter of has been two to four cents higher than normal levels as a result of this strong demand  which should benefit margins in our processing segment s merchant business 
we expect isobutane pricing to trend toward the historical norm by the end of the first quarter and remain so during the second quarter 
propylene fractionation unit margins are expected to remain flat during the first half of due to the weak economy and additional supplies coming to market from new third party facilities 
if the domestic economy improves as anticipated during  we expect that the demand for propylene fractionation services will increase as the market absorbs the additional market supply 
our mtbe facility underwent its annual maintenance turnaround in january equity earnings from this facility for the first quarter of are expected to benefit from strong mtbe pricing caused by a number of other mtbe units undergoing maintenance turnarounds which reduced overall mtbe supply 
as we enter the second quarter of  mtbe pricing is expected to further strengthen as refiners begin purchasing mtbe in preparation for gasoline blending requirements for the upcoming summer driving season

these methods  estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates should the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
examples of these estimates and assumptions include depreciation methods and estimated lives of property  plant and equipment  amortization methods and estimated lives of qualifying intangible assets  revenue recognition policies and mark to market accounting procedures 
the following describes the estimation risk in each of these significant financial statement items property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
our plants  pipelines and storage facilities have estimated useful lives of five to years 
our miscellaneous transportation equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life must take a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal deterioration and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
additionally  if we determine that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors  we would review the asset for impairment and record any necessary reduction in the asset s value as a charge against earnings 
at december  and  the net book value or undepreciated cost of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion 
for additional information regarding our property  plant and equipment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the values assigned to contract based assets that have a fixed or definite term 
at december   the principal item recorded as an intangible asset was the year shell natural gas processing agreement 
the value of this contract is being amortized on a straight line basis over its contract term currently million annually from through july 
if the economic life of this contract were later determined to be impaired due to negative changes in shell s natural gas exploration and production activities in the gulf of mexico  then we might need to reduce the amortization period of this asset to less than the contractually stated year life of the agreement 
such a change would increase the annual amortization charge at that time 
at december   the unamortized value of this contract was million 
revenue recognition 
in general  we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met i firm contracts are in place  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii pricing is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
when contracts settle ie  either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed  we determine if an allowance is necessary and record accordingly 
the revenues that we record are not materially based on estimates 
we believe the assumptions underlying any revenue estimates that we might use will not prove to be significantly different from actual amounts due to the short term nature of these estimates 
of the contracts that we enter into with customers  the majority fall within five main categories as described below 
tolling or throughput arrangements where we process or transport customer volumes for a cash fee usually on a per gallon or other unit of measurement basis  
in kind fractionation arrangements where we process customer mixed ngl volumes for a percentage of the end ngl products in lieu of a cash fee exclusive to our norco ngl fractionation facility  
merchant contracts where we sell products to customers at market related prices for cash  
storage agreements where we store volumes or reserve storage capacity for customers for a cash fee  and 
fee based marketing services where we market volumes for customers for either a percentage of the final cash sales price or a cash fee per gallon handled 
a number of tolling or throughput arrangements are utilized in our fractionation and pipeline segments 
examples include ngl fractionation  isomerization and pipeline transportation agreements 
typically  we recognize revenue from tolling arrangements once contract services have been performed 
at times  the tolling fees we or our affiliates charge for pipeline transportation services are regulated by such governmental agencies as the ferc 
a special type of tolling arrangement  an in kind contract  is utilized by various customers at our norco ngl fractionation facility 
an in kind processing contract allows us to retain a contractually determined percentage of ngl products produced for the customer in lieu of a cash tolling fee per gallon 
revenue is recognized from these in kind contracts when we sell at market related prices and deliver the fractionated ngls that we retained 
our processing segment businesses employ tolling and merchant contracts 
if a customer pays us a cash tolling fee for our natural gas processing services  we record revenue to the extent that natural gas volumes have been processed and sent back to the producer 
if we retain mixed ngls as our fee for natural gas processing services  we record revenue when the ngls in mixed and or fractionated product form are sold and delivered to customers using merchant contracts 
in addition to the processing segment  merchant contracts are utilized in the fractionation segment to record revenues from the sale of propylene volumes and in the pipelines segment to record revenues from the sale of natural gas 
our merchant contracts are generally based on market related prices as determined by the individual agreements 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential bad debts from customers 
our allowance amount is generally determined as a percentage of revenues for the last twelve months 
in addition  we may also increase the allowance account in response to specific identification of customers involved in bankruptcy proceedings and the like 
we routinely review our estimates in this area to ascertain that we have recorded ample reserves to cover forecasted losses 
if unanticipated financial difficulties were to occur with a significant customer or customers  there is the possibility that the allowance for doubtful accounts would need to be increased to bring the allowance up to an appropriate level based on the new information obtained 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million 
fair value accounting for financial instruments 
our earnings are also affected by use of the mark to market method of accounting required under gaap for certain financial instruments 
we use financial instruments such as swaps  forwards and other contracts to manage price risks associated with inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions  primarily within our processing segment 
currently none of these financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and thus the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings ie  using the mark to market method rather than being deferred until the firm commitment or anticipated transaction affects earnings 
the use of mark to market accounting for financial instruments results in a degree of non cash earnings volatility that is dependent upon changes in underlying indexes  primarily commodity prices 
fair value for the financial instruments we employ is determined using price data from highly liquid markets such as the nymex commodity exchange 
at december   our financial statements reflected million of mark to market income related to commodity financial instruments whose longest maturity date was december for additional information regarding our use of financial instruments to manage risk and the earnings sensitivity of these instruments to changes in underlying commodity prices  see item a on page additional information regarding the significant accounting policies underlying preparation of our financial statements including revenue recognition can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page f our results of operations we have five reportable operating segments fractionation  pipelines  processing  octane enhancement and other 
fractionation primarily includes ngl fractionation  isomerization and propylene fractionation 
pipelines consists of liquids and natural gas pipeline systems  storage and import export terminal services 
processing includes our natural gas processing business and related merchant activities 
octane enhancement represents our interest in a facility that produces motor gasoline additives to enhance octane currently producing mtbe 
the other operating segment primarily consists of fee based marketing services 
our management evaluates segment performance based on gross operating margin gross operating margin or margin 
gross operating margin for each segment represents operating income before depreciation and amortization  lease expense obligations retained by epco  gains and losses on the sale of assets and selling  general and administrative expenses 
segment gross operating margin is exclusive of interest expense  interest income amounts  dividend income  minority interest  extraordinary charges and other income and expense transactions 
we include equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in segment gross operating margin and as a component of revenues 
our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy and a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with a supplier of raw materials to a facility or a consumer of finished products from a facility 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations 
for example  we use the promix ngl fractionator to process ngls extracted by our gas plants 
the ngls received from promix then can be sold by our merchant businesses 
another example would be our relationship with the bef mtbe facility 
our isomerization facilities process normal butane for this plant and our hsc pipeline transports mtbe for delivery to bef s storage facility on the houston ship channel 
our gross operating margin by segment in thousands of dollars along with a reconciliation to consolidated operating income for the past three years were as follows for year ended december  gross operating margin by segment fractionation    pipeline    processing    octane enhancement    other  gross operating margin total    depreciation and amortization    retained lease expense  net    loss gain on sale of assets  selling  general and administrative expenses    consolidated operating income    our significant plant production and other volumetric data for the last three years were as follows for year ended december  mbpd  net equity ngl production ngl fractionation isomerization propylene fractionation octane enhancement major ngl and petrochemical pipelines bbtu d  net natural gas pipelines  n a n a year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
fiscal was our best year ever as measured in terms of revenues  gross operating margin and operating income 
our revenues were a record billion in compared to billion in operating costs and expenses increased to billion in from billion in gross operating margin increased to million in from million in operating income also posted a record million in versus million in the increases in revenues and costs and expenses are primarily due to our natural gas pipeline acquisitions completed in acadian gas and the gulf of mexico lines offset by lower product prices in relative to the increase in gross operating margin and operating income is primarily attributable to acquisitions and new construction  plus a rise in income relating to commodity hedging activities offset by generally lower product prices 
fractionation 
gross operating margin from our fractionation segment decreased to million in from million in ngl fractionation margin for declined million from  primarily as the result of a million decrease in in kind fractionation fees at our norco facility 
an in kind arrangement allows us to receive ngl volumes in lieu of cash fractionation fees norco being our only facility with this type of contract 
the decline in ngl fractionation margin is related to the ngl volumes received during having a higher value than those received during net volumes at the ngl fractionation facilities decreased to mbpd in compared to mbpd in the decrease in throughput is due to lower ngl extraction rates at gas processing facilities in early due to the abnormally high cost of natural gas versus when the industry was maximizing ngl production 
the isomerization business posted an million increase in margin for over on volumes of mbpd 
isomerization margins were bolstered by increased demand during the second quarter of for services linked to refinery activities  primarily gasoline blending 
gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased million in over due to additional margins from brpc which did not commence operations until july net volumes at our propylene fractionation facilities declined slightly to mbpd in from mbpd in pipelines 
our pipelines segment posted a record gross operating margin of million in  compared to million in of the million increase in margin  million is attributable to natural gas pipelines acquired in ie  acadian gas and the gulf of mexico systems 
acadian gas added million in margin with the gulf of mexico systems contributing million 
on a net basis  these pipeline systems transported an average of  bbtu d of natural gas 
net liquid transportation volumes increased to mbpd in from mbpd in the majority of this increase is attributable to a rise in commercial butane imports related to seasonal demand for isobutane production 
this activity contributed to a million combined increase in margin from our import terminal and hsc pipeline system 
additionally  margin from the louisiana pipeline system increased million in due to increased demand for transportation services with volumes increasing by mbpd in  a increase year to year 
also  our recently completed lou tex ngl pipeline added million to margin during construction of this system being completed in the fourth quarter of 
this pipeline benefited from the movement of mixed ngls out of louisiana to our mont belvieu processing facility during processing 
earnings from our processing segment were a record million in  up from million in this segment is comprised of our natural gas processing business and related merchant activities 
the increase in margin is primarily due to the positive impact of our commodity hedging activities 
was a very challenging year for gas processors industry wide 
the volatility of natural gas prices and the depressed nature of ngl prices throughout created an environment requiring processors to be proactive in meeting the needs of the marketplace 
the unusually poor processing economics of the first quarter of due to the abnormally high cost of energy relative to the value of our ngl production during that time yielded to improved market conditions during the second half of as energy costs moderated 
in general  prices received for our ngl production approximated a weighted average of cents per gallon in compared to cents per gallon in in contrast  the cost of natural gas averaged per mmbtu in peaking at near per mmbtu during the first quarter of versus per mmbtu in equity ngl production averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd in the decline in volume is related to the period reflecting near maximized ngl recoveries supported by strong ngl economics 
the equity ngl production rate reflects less favorable extraction economics as described above but is greatly improved relative to the first quarter of s mbpd when energy costs peaked 
with the improvement in processing margins in late  we posted a record equity ngl production of mbpd during the fourth quarter of we employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the effects of fluctuating commodity prices primarily ngl and natural gas prices on our gas processing business and related merchant activities 
margin for includes million of income from commodity hedging activities  an increase of million over such income in the loss in value of our ngl production has been mitigated or in some cases  exceeded by such income during without this income  margin from gas processing would have declined million year to year 
a large number of our commodity financial instruments are currently based on the historical relationship between natural gas prices and ngl prices 
this type of hedging strategy utilizes the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on ngl merchant activities and the value of our equity ngl production 
during  we benefited from the general decline in natural gas prices relative to our fixed positions 
the decline in natural gas prices allowed us to realize net cash gains on the settlement and closeout of certain positions of approximately million 
the million difference between the realized amount and the million in income from these financial instruments represents the non cash mark to market income on positions open at december  based on market prices at that date 
if natural gas prices had not declined to the degree seen during the year  we would have recognized less income or potentially even a loss on hedging activities offset somewhat by correlative higher ngl prices which would have increased the value of our ngl production 
a variety of factors influence whether or not our hedging strategies are successful 
for additional information regarding our commodity financial instruments  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk beginning on page we are exposed to settlement risk a form of credit risk with our counterparties to these financial instruments 
on all transactions where we are exposed to settlement risk  management analyzes the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis 
in december  enron north america the counterparty to some of our commodity financial instruments filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we recognized a charge to earnings of million for all amounts owed to us by enron 
the enron amounts were unsecured and the amount that we may ultimately recover  if any  is not presently determinable 
our merchant activities benefited from i strong propane demand in the first quarter of for heating and ii isobutane in the second quarter of for refining 
overall  margin from merchant activities improved million year to year 
processing margin also benefited from the reversal of million in excess reserves associated with the gas processing plants 
octane enhancement 
equity earnings from our bef investment declined million year to year on stable net volumes of mbpd in both periods 
the decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to lower mtbe and by product prices 
other 
gross operating margin from our other segment was million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a rise in operating costs of plant support functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to expenses related to the additional staff and resources deemed necessary to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased by million over that for 
the increase is primarily due to the issuance of our million of public debt in january the senior notes b  see page 
the proceeds from this debt were used to acquire the gulf of mexico pipelines from el paso  acadian gas from shell and to finance internal growth and other general partnership purposes 
interest expense for both and benefited from income attributable to interest rate hedging activity 
during the last two years  we used interest rate swaps in order to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
with the decline in variable interest rates over the last two years  our swaps provided income to offset fixed rate based interest expense 
for  we recognized a million benefit related to these swaps compared with a million benefit recorded in during  two of our three swaps that were outstanding at january  were terminated closing instruments having a notional value of million 
one swap was terminated by a counterparty exercising its early termination option while the other counterparty negotiated an early closeout of its position 
this left us with one swap outstanding at december  having a notional amount of million 
this swap has an early termination option that is exercisable in march for additional information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk  see page year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
our revenues increased to billion in compared to billion in while operating costs and expenses increased to billion in versus billion in gross operating margin increased to million in compared to million in resulting in a year to year increase in operating income of million to million in from million in the year to year increase in revenues  operating costs and expenses  gross operating margin and operating income is primarily attributable to the tngl acquisition 
the period includes five months of margins associated with tngl operations august through december whereas the period includes twelve months 
fractionation 
the gross operating margin of our fractionation segment increased to million in from million in the additional margin from the ngl fractionators acquired from shell in the tngl acquisition was the primary reason for a million increase in ngl fractionation margin in over as noted previously  includes five months of margin from the tngl assets whereas the period includes twelve months 
net ngl fractionation volume increased to mbpd in from mbpd in the increase in net ngl fractionation volume is attributable to higher production rates at our mont belvieu ngl fractionator 
our ownership in this facility increased to from as a result of the july mba acquisition 
for  gross operating margin from our isomerization business decreased million compared to primarily due to higher fuel and other operating costs  plus the expenses related to the refurbishment of an isomerization unit 
isomerization volumes were mbpd in both and gross operating margin from propylene fractionation decreased million in from levels primarily due to higher energy costs 
net volumes at these facilities improved to mbpd in from mbpd in due to the startup of the brpc propylene concentrator in july pipelines 
gross operating margin from our pipelines segment was million in compared to million in overall liquids volumes increased to mbpd in from mbpd in generally  the million increase in margin is attributable to the additional volumes and margins contributed by the tngl pipeline and storage assets  higher margins from the hsc pipeline system and epik due to an increase in export volumes  the margins from the lou tex propylene pipeline that was purchased in march and margins from the lou tex ngl pipeline which commenced operations in late november the growth in export volumes is attributable to the installation of epik s new chiller unit that began operations in the fourth quarter of on february   the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline and related assets from shell was completed at a cost of approximately million 
construction of the lou tex ngl pipeline was completed during the fourth quarter of at a cost of approximately million 
processing 
our processing segment generated million in gross operating margin during compared to million in the million increase is primarily due to including twelve months of gas processing and related merchant activity margins from the tngl businesses  whereas includes only five months 
this segment benefited from a stronger ngl pricing environment in versus and a rise in equity ngl production from mbpd in to mbpd in octane enhancement 
gross operating margin from our octane enhancement segment increased to million in from million in this segment consists entirely of our investment in bef  a joint venture facility that currently produces mtbe 
equity earnings for improved over levels primarily due to higher than normal mtbe market prices during the second and third quarters of and lower debt service costs bef made its final note payment in may and  as a result  now owns the facility debt free 
in addition  the period reflects a million non cash charge related to the write off of certain start up expenses 
mtbe production  on a net basis  was mbpd in both and other 
gross operating margin from our other segment was million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to fee based marketing services added in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to expenses related to the additional staff and resources deemed necessary to support our expansion activities resulting from acquisitions and other business development 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to a rise in average debt levels from million in to million in debt levels have increased over the previous year primarily due to capital expenditures for assets such as the lou tex propylene and lou tex ngl pipelines and the issuance of million in debt instruments the senior notes a and mbfc loan in march interest expense for includes a million benefit related to interest rate swaps 
our liquidity and capital resources general 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service  are for capital expenditures both sustaining and expansion related  business acquisitions and distributions to partners 
we expect to fund our short term needs for such items as operating expenses  sustaining capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to partners with operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources including either separately or in combination cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of additional common units and public debt 
our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and or refinancing arrangements 
operating cash flows primarily reflect the effects of net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  equity income and cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates  fluctuations in fair values of financial instruments and changes in operating accounts 
the net effect of changes in operating accounts is generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period 
cash flows from operations are directly linked to earnings from our business activities 
like our results of operations  these cash flows are exposed to certain risks including fluctuations in ngl and energy prices  competitive practices in the midstream energy industry and the impact of operational and systems risks 
the products that we process  sell or transport are principally used as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing and in the production of motor gasoline and as fuel for residential and commercial heating 
reduced demand for our products or services by industrial customers  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand for the end products made with ngl products  increased competition from petroleum based products due to pricing differences or other reasons  could have a negative impact on earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors pertinent to our businesses  see page as noted above  certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are met using borrowings under bank credit facilities and or the issuance of additional common units or public debt separately or in combination 
as of december   availability under our revolving credit facilities was million which may be increased by an additional million under certain conditions 
we issued million of public debt in january the senior notes b using the remaining availability under the december million universal shelf registration 
the proceeds of this offering were used to acquire acadian gas and the gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems  to finance the cost to construct certain ngl pipelines and related projects and for working capital and other general partnership purposes 
on february   we filed a million universal shelf registration the february shelf covering the issuance of an unspecified amount of equity or debt securities or a combination thereof 
for additional information regarding our debt  see the section below labeled long term debt 
in june  we received approval from our unitholders to increase by  the number of common units available and unreserved for general partnership purposes during the subordination period 
this increase has improved our future financial flexibility in any potential expansion project or business acquisition 
after taking into account the units issued in connection with tngl acquisition   units are available and unreserved on a pre split basis see two for one split of limited partner units below for general partnership purposes during the subordination period which generally extends until the first day of any quarter beginning after june  when certain financial tests have be satisfied 
after this period expires  we may prudently issue an unlimited number of units for general partnership purposes 
if deemed necessary  we believe that additional financing arrangements can be obtained at reasonable terms 
furthermore  we believe that maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings combined with a continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
credit ratings 
our current investment grade credit ratings of baa by moody s investor service and bbb by standard and poors highlight our financial flexibility 
the outlook for both of the ratings is stable 
we maintain regular communications with these rating agencies which independently judge our creditworthiness based on a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors 
in may  moody s upgraded their rating of us from baa to baa they cited that our operating capabilities and growth opportunities had been significantly enhanced by the acquisition of acadian gas and the purchase of equity interests in four gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems 
we believe that the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating is important in managing our liquidity and capital resource requirements 
two for one split of limited partner units 
on february   we announced that the board of directors of the general partner had approved a two for one split for each class of our units 
the partnership unit split will be accomplished by distributing one additional partnership unit for each partnership unit outstanding to holders of record on april  the units will be distributed on may  all references to number of units or earnings per unit contained in this document relate to the pre split units  except if indicated otherwise 
consolidated cash flows for year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities were million in versus million in after adjusting for changes in operating accounts which are generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period  adjusted cash flow from operating activities would be million in as compared to million in cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating accounts is an important measure of our liquidity 
it provides an indication of our success in generating core cash flows from the assets and investments that we own 
the million increase for is attributable to our strong earnings as discussed earlier under our results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  investing cash flows 
during  we used million of cash to finance investing activities compared to million in over the last two years  we have funded million in internal growth projects 
of this amount  million in capital expenditures has been devoted to various pipeline projects including million spent to purchase the lou tex propylene pipeline  million to construct the lou tex ngl pipeline million spent in with the remainder spent in and million in expansion activities related to our louisiana pipeline system 
we spent million on sustaining capital expenditures during the last two years with million in such charges recorded during our investing cash outflows for include the million paid to acquire acadian gas from shell 
this amount is subject to certain post closing adjustments expected to be completed during the first half of in addition  our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased million in due to the million paid to purchase equity interests in several gulf of mexico natural gas pipeline systems from el paso 
financing cash flows 
our financing activities generated million of cash receipts during compared to cash payments of million in cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by repayments of debt  borrowings under debt agreements and distributions to partners 
cash flow from financing activities in includes proceeds from the million senior notes b issued in january whereas the period includes proceeds from the million senior notes a and million mbfc loan and the associated repayments on various bank credit facilities 
cash distributions to partners and the minority interest increased to million in from million in primarily due to i increases in the quarterly distribution rate and ii the conversion of million of shell s special units into common units 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a history of quarterly distribution rates and increases since the first quarter of our cash distribution policy as managed by the general partner at its sole discretion has allowed us to retain a significant amount of cash flow for reinvestment in the growth of the business 
over the last two years  we have retained approximately million to fund expansions and business acquisitions 
we believe that our cash distribution policy provides the partnership with financial flexibility in executing its growth strategy 
in july  the general partner instituted a two year buy back program the buy back program that would allow enterprise products partners lp epplp  on a stand alone basis to repurchase and retire up to million of its publicly owned common units 
our intent under the buy back program is to reacquire common units during periods of temporary market weakness at price levels that would be accretive to our remaining unitholders 
under this original program  epplp repurchased and retired  common units during at a cost of million 
during the first quarter of  we established a revocable grantor trust the trust to fund potential future obligations under the epco agreement with respect to epco s long term incentive plan through the exercise of options granted to epco employees or directors of the general partner 
at december   this consolidated trust owned  common units the trust units which are accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock under the cost method of accounting 
the trust units are considered outstanding and receive distributions  however  they are excluded from the calculation of earnings per unit 
in september  the general partner modified the buy back program to allow both epplp and the trust to repurchase common units 
under the modified terms of the program  purchases made by epplp will be retired whereas the units purchased by the trust will remain outstanding and not be retired 
at december    additional publicly owned common units on a pre split basis could be repurchased under the buy back program by epplp and or the trust 
purchases made under this program by epplp will be funded by special cash distributions from the operating partnership whereas purchases made by the trust will be funded by cash contributions from the operating partnership 
these purchases will be balanced with our plans to grow the company through investments in internally developed projects and acquisitions  while maintaining an investment grade debt rating 
the trust purchased  common units under this program during at a cost of million 
the trust subsequently reissued  treasury units for proceeds of million 
for additional information regarding the trust  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million in restricted cash required by the nymex commodity exchange to facilitate financial instrument and physical purchase transactions 
this amount can fluctuate over time depending on the physical volumes underlying the contracts  market price of the commodity and type of transactions executed 
during  our restricted cash balance required by the exchange varied  reaching a peak of million in july 
consolidated cash flows for year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in after adjusting for changes in operating accounts which are generally the result of timing of sales and purchases near the end of each period  adjusted cash flow from operating activities increased million to million in compared to million in the million increase in adjusted cash flow from operating activities between periods is primarily due to the impact of the tngl acquisition as discussed earlier under our results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  investing cash flows 
we invested million during primarily in internal growth projects compared to million spent during primarily for acquisitions 
fiscal reflects million in net cash payments resulting from the tngl and mba acquisitions 
our capital expenditures increased substantially in over primarily due to the purchase of the lou tex propylene pipeline million and construction costs related to the lou tex ngl pipeline million 
investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates during include our share of costs million to complete construction and commence operations of the brf facility and wilprise and tri states pipelines 
our expenditures include million paid to purchase an additional interest in dixie 
the and amounts also include a combined million in costs to construct the brpc facility  which was completed in july financing cash flows 
our financing activities resulted in net cash payments of million in versus net cash receipts of million in fiscal includes proceeds from the issuance of senior notes a and the mbfc loan and the associated repayments on various bank credit facilities 
financing activities in include the borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance the tngl and mba acquisitions and million paid by the trust to repurchase and treat as treasury units  of our publicly traded common units 
distributions to partners and the minority interest increased to million in compared to million in primarily due to increases in the quarterly distribution rate 
lastly  epplp repurchased and retired  common units during under its buy back program see page at a cost of million 
cash requirements for future growth we are committed to the long term growth and viability of the company 
our strategy involves expansion through business acquisitions and internal growth projects 
in recent years  major oil and gas companies have sold non strategic assets in the midstream natural gas industry in which we operate 
we forecast that this trend will continue  and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar disposal options 
management continues to analyze potential acquisitions  joint venture or similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets and geographic regions 
we believe that the company is well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions that will expand its platform of assets and through internal growth projects 
our goal for fiscal is to invest at least million in such opportunities that will be accretive to our investors 
the funds needed to achieve this goal can be attained through a combination of operating cash flows  debt or equity 
during january and february  we spent approximately million to acquire hydrocarbon storage and propylene fractionation facilities and related assets from d k 
of this amount  approximately million was funded by a drawdown on our multi year and day credit facilities leaving million of unused commitments available under these credit agreements 
the increase in outstanding debt will translate into additional debt service costs during another stated goal of management is to increase the distribution rate to our investors by at least annually 
at the end of  the annual rate was per common unit 
we forecast that operating cash flows will be sufficient in to increase the rate to at least per common unit on a pre split basis 
on february   we announced an increase in the quarterly distribution from per common unit to per common unit on a pre split basis 
based on the number of distribution bearing units projected to be outstanding during  we project that this goal will translate into cash distributions increasing by approximately million over the amounts paid to partners and the minority interest during future capital expenditures 
during  we forecast that approximately million will be spent on expansion capital projects  of which million is related to our pipelines segment 
in addition  we expect to spend million on sustaining capital expenditures 
we generally classify improvements and major renewals of existing assets as sustaining capital expenditures and all other capital spending on existing and new assets referred to as expansion capital expenditures 
both expansion and sustaining capital expenditures are recorded as cash outlays for property  plant and equipment 
maintenance  repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations as incurred 
our unconsolidated affiliates forecast a combined million in capital expenditures during of which we will fund approximately million 
the following table shows our projected capital spending by operating segment for in thousands of dollars expenditure type investments in operating property  plant unconsolidated segment and equipment affiliates total fractionation    pipelines    processing   octane enhancement other   total    at december   we had million in outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects 
of this amount  million is related to the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment and million is associated with capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates which will be recorded as additional investments 
new environmental regulations in the state of texas may necessitate extensive redesign and modification of the our mont belvieu facilities to achieve the air emissions reductions needed for federal clean air act compliance in the houston galveston  texas area 
the technical practicality and economic reasonableness of these regulations have been challenged under state law in litigation filed on january   against the texas natural resource conservation commission and its principal officials in the district court of travis county  texas  by a coalition of major houston galveston area industries including the company 
until this litigation is resolved  the precise level of technology to be employed and the cost for modifying the facilities to achieve the required amount of reductions cannot be determined 
currently  the litigation has been stayed by agreement of the parties pending the outcome of expanded  cooperative scientific research to more precisely define sources and mechanisms of air pollution in the houston galveston area 
completion of this research and formulation of the regulatory response are anticipated in mid regardless of the results of this research and the outcome of the litigation  expenditures for air emissions reduction projects will be spread over several years  and we believe that adequate liquidity and capital resources will exist for us to undertake them 
we have budgeted capital funds in to begin making modifications to certain mont belvieu facilities that will result in air emission reductions 
the methods employed to achieve these reductions will be compatible with whatever regulatory requirements are eventually put in place

long term debt our long term debt consisted of the following at december  borrowings under senior notes a  fixed rate  due march   mbfc loan  fixed rate  due march   senior notes b  fixed rate  due february  total principal amount   unamortized balance of increase in fair value related to hedging a portion of fixed rate debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  less unamortized discount on senior notes a senior notes b less current maturities of long term debt long term debt   long term debt does not reflect the million multi year credit facility or the million day credit facility 
no amount was outstanding under either of these two revolving credit facilities at december  see below for a complete description of these facilities 
at december   we had a total of million of standby letters of credit capacity under our multi year credit facility of which million was outstanding 
we act as guarantor of certain debt obligations of our primary consolidated subsidiary  the operating partnership 
this parent subsidiary guaranty provision exists under our senior notes  mbfc loan and two current revolving credit facilities 
in the descriptions that follow  the term mlp denotes us in this guarantor role 
senior notes a 
on march   we completed a public offering of million in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes due march  at a price to the public of per senior note the senior notes a 
these notes were issued to retire certain revolving credit loan balances that were created as a result of the tngl acquisition and other general partnership activities 
the senior notes a are subject to a make whole redemption right 
the notes are an unsecured obligation and rank equally with existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness 
the notes are guaranteed by the mlp through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee and were issued under an indenture containing certain restrictive covenants 
these covenants restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions 
we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants at december  senior notes b 
on january   we completed a public offering of million in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes due february  at a price to the public of per senior note the senior notes b 
these notes were issued to finance the acquisition of acadian gas  neptune  nemo and starfish  to cover construction costs of certain ngl pipelines and related projects  and to fund other general partnership activities 
the senior notes b were issued under the same indenture as senior notes a and therefore are subject to similar terms and restrictive covenants 
the senior notes b are guaranteed by the mlp through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee 
we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants at december  mbfc loan 
on march   we executed a million loan agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation mbfc having a fixed rate and a maturity date of march  in general  the proceeds from this loan were used to retire certain revolving credit loan balances attributable to acquiring and constructing the pascagoula  mississippi natural gas processing facility 
the mbfc loan is subject to a make whole redemption right and is guaranteed by the mlp through an unsecured and unsubordinated guarantee 
the indenture agreement contains an acceleration clause whereby the outstanding principal and interest on the loan may become due and payable if our credit ratings decline below a baa rating by moody s currently baa and below a bbb rating by standard and poors currently bbb 
under these circumstances  the trustee as defined in the indenture agreement may  and if requested to do so by holders of at least in aggregate of the principal amount of the outstanding underlying bonds  shall accelerate the maturity of the mbfc loan  whereby the principal and all accrued interest would become immediately due and payable 
if such an event occurred  we would have the option a to redeem the mbfc loan or b to provide an alternate credit agreement as defined in the indenture agreement to support our obligation under the mbfc loan  with both options exercisable within days of receiving notice of the decline in our credit ratings from the ratings agencies 
the loan agreement contains certain covenants including maintaining appropriate levels of insurance on the pascagoula facility and restrictions regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants at december  multi year credit facility 
on november   we entered into a million five year revolving credit facility that includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
the november  maturity date may be extended for one year at our option with the consent of the lenders  subject to the extension provisions in the agreement 
we can increase the amount borrowed under this facility  with the consent of the administrative agent whose consent may not be unreasonably withheld  up to an amount not exceeding million by adding to the facility one or more new lenders and or increasing the commitments of existing lenders  so long as the aggregate amount of the funds borrowed under this credit facility and the day credit facility described below does not exceed million 
no lender will be required to increase its original commitment  unless it agrees to do so at its sole discretion 
this credit facility is guaranteed by the mlp through an unsecured guarantee 
proceeds from this credit facility will be used for working capital  acquisitions and other general partnership purposes 
no borrowing was outstanding for this credit facility at december  in february  we borrowed million under this facility to complete our purchase of d k s mont belvieu  texas propylene fractionation assets 
our obligations under this bank credit facility are unsecured general obligations and are non recourse to the general partner 
as defined within the agreement  borrowings under this bank credit facility will generally bear interest at either i the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus one half percent or ii a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or iii a competitive bid rate 
we elect the basis for the interest rate at the time of each borrowing 
our credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants to  among other things  i incur certain indebtedness  ii grant certain liens  iii enter into certain merger or consolidation transactions and iv make certain investments 
in addition  we may not directly or indirectly make any distribution in respect of our partnership interests  except those payments in connection with the buy back program not to exceed million in the aggregate  see note and distributions from available cash from operating surplus  both as defined within the agreement 
the credit agreement also requires that we satisfy certain financial covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter 
as defined within the agreement  we i must maintain consolidated net worth of million and ii not permit our ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  including pro forma adjustments as defined within the agreement  for the previous four quarter period to exceed to if we fail to maintain these financial covenants  either the unused commitments under this facility will terminate or the outstanding principal balance in whole or part at the discretion of the lenders will be immediately payable or both 
since these ratios are dependent to a varying degree upon earnings  any sustained decline in our profitability would have a negative impact on these calculations 
the company was in compliance with the restrictive covenants at december  day credit facility 
in conjunction with the multi year credit agreement  we entered into a day million revolving bank credit facility 
in november  we and our lenders amended the revolving credit agreement to extend the maturity date to november  with an option to convert any revolving credit balance outstanding at november  to a one year term loan 
we can increase the amount borrowed under this facility  with the consent of the administrative agent whose consent may not be unreasonably withheld  up to an amount not exceeding million by adding to the facility one or more new lenders and or increasing the commitments of existing lenders  so long as the aggregate amount of the funds borrowed under this credit facility and the multi year credit facility do not exceed million

we elect the basis for the interest rate at the time of each borrowing 
proceeds from this credit facility will be used for working capital  acquisitions and other general partnership purposes 
no amount was outstanding for this credit facility at december  limitations on certain actions by the company and financial condition covenants of this bank credit facility are substantially consistent with those existing for the multi year credit facility as described previously 
we were in compliance with the restrictive covenants at december  february shelf on february   we filed a million universal shelf registration the february shelf covering the issuance of an unspecified amount of equity or debt securities or a combination thereof 
we expect to use the net proceeds from any sale of securities for future business acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  such as working capital  investments in subsidiaries  the retirement of existing debt and or the repurchase of common units or other securities 
the exact amounts to be used and when the net proceeds will be applied to partnership purposes will depend on a number of factors  including our funding requirements and the availability of alternative funding sources 
we routinely review acquisition opportunities

impact of recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued two new pronouncements sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  there are also transition provisions that apply to business combinations completed before july   that were accounted for by the purchase method 
sfas no 
became effective january  for all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  within six months our adoption of sfas no 
by june   we will have completed a transitional impairment review to identify if there is an impairment to the december  recorded goodwill or intangible assets of indefinite life using a fair value methodology 
professionals in the business valuation industry will be consulted to validate the assumptions used in such methodologies 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the quarter ended june  subsequent impairment losses will be reflected in operating income in the statements of consolidated operations 
at january   our intangible assets included the values assigned to the year shell natural gas processing agreement the shell agreement and the excess cost of the purchase price over the fair market value of the assets acquired from mont belvieu associates the mba excess cost  both of which were initially recorded in the value of the shell agreement million net book value at december  is being amortized on a straight line basis over its contract term 
likewise  the mba excess cost million net book value at december  was being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
based upon initial interpretations of the new accounting standards  we anticipate that the intangible asset related to the shell agreement will continue to be amortized over its contract term million annually for through july  however  the mba excess cost will be reclassified to goodwill in accordance with the new standard and its amortization will cease currently  million annually 
this goodwill would then be subject to impairment testing as prescribed in sfas no 
we are continuing to evaluate the comprehensive provisions of sfas no 
and will fully adopt the standard during within the prescribed time periods 
in addition to sfas no 
and no 
 the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  in june this statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are continuing to evaluate the provisions of this statement 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted this statement effective january  and determined that it will have no material impact on our financial statements as of that date 
uncertainties regarding our investment in bef we have a ownership interest in bef  which owns a facility currently producing mtbe 
the production of mtbe is driven by oxygenated fuels programs enacted under the federal clean air act amendments of and other legislation 
any change to these programs that enable localities to elect to not participate in these programs  lessen the requirements for oxygenates or favor the use of non isobutane based oxygenated fuels would reduce the demand for mtbe 
in  the governor of california ordered the phase out of mtbe in california by the end of due to allegations by several public advocacy and protest groups that mtbe contaminates water supplies  causes health problems and has not been as beneficial in reducing air pollution as originally contemplated 
subsequently  the epa denied california s request for a waiver of the oxygenate requirement and the state is now reconsidering the timing of its mtbe ban 
legislation introduced in the us senate would eliminate the clean air act s oxygenate requirement in order to foster the elimination of mtbe in fuel by individual states such as california 
legislation introduced in the us house to prevent states from banning mtbe was defeated in no assurance can be given as to whether the federal government or individual states will ultimately adopt legislation banning or promoting the use of mtbe as part of their clean air programs 
in light of these regulatory developments  the owners of bef have been formulating a contingency plan for use of the bef facility if mtbe were banned or significantly curtailed 
management is exploring a possible conversion of the bef facility from mtbe production to alkylate production 
we believe that if mtbe usage is banned or significantly curtailed  the motor gasoline industry would need a substitute additive to maintain octane levels in motor gasoline and that alkylate would be an attractive substitute 
depending upon the type of alkylate process chosen and the level of alkylate production desired  the cost to convert the facility from mtbe production to alkylate production would range from million to million  with our share of these costs ranging from million to million 
we issued the last installment of special units to shell in august on or about june   shell met certain year performance criteria for the issuance of the last installment of million non distribution bearing  convertible contingency units referred to as special units when issued 
under a contingent unit agreement with shell executed as part of the tngl acquisition  we issued these special units on august  the issuance of these new special units had an impact on diluted earnings per unit beginning with the third quarter of the value of these special units was determined to be million using present value techniques 
this amount increased the purchase price of the tngl acquisition and the value of the shell processing agreement when the additional special units were issued and recorded in august this amount also increased the equity position of shell in the company by million with the general partner contributing million to maintain its respective ownership in the company 
the million increase in value of the shell processing agreement will be amortized over the remaining life of the contract 
as a result  amortization expense will increase by approximately million annually 
we converted a portion of shell s special units into common units in august in accordance with existing agreements with shell  million of shell s original issue of special units issued in connection with the tngl acquisition converted into common units on august  the conversion had an impact on basic earnings per unit and cash distributions to shell beginning with the third quarter of of the million special units that remain outstanding at december   million are scheduled to convert into common units in august with the balance of million converting in august response to september  terrorist attacks following the recent terrorist attacks in the united states  we instituted a review of security measures and practices and emergency response capabilities for all facilities and sensitive infrastructure 
in connection with this activity  we participated in security coordination efforts with law enforcement and public safety authorities  industry mutual aid groups and regulatory agencies 
as a result of these steps  we believe that security measures  techniques and equipment have been enhanced as appropriate on a location by location basis 
further evaluation will be ongoing  with additional measures to be taken as specific governmental alerts  additional information about improving security and new facts come to our attention 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in commodity prices in our natural gas and ngl businesses and in interest rates with respect to a portion of our debt obligations 
we may use financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions  primarily in our processing segment 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future earnings and cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
as a matter of policy  we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
apart from the disclosures below  additional information regarding our financial instruments financial assets and liabilities can be found under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity financial instruments 
our processing and octane enhancement segments are directly exposed to commodity price risk through their respective business operations 
the prices of natural gas  ngls and mtbe are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of domestic oil  natural gas and ngl production and development  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations  the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity  the availability of alternative fuels and products  seasonal demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  conservation  the extent of governmental regulation of production and the overall economic environment 
in order to manage the risks associated with our processing segment  we may enter into swaps  forwards  commodity futures  options and other commodity financial instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
the primary purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl production and inventories  firm commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
we do not hedge our exposure to the mtbe markets 
also  in our pipelines segment  we may utilize a limited number of commodity financial instruments to manage the price acadian gas charges certain of its customers for natural gas and or the price acadian gas pays for the natural gas it purchases 
we have adopted a commercial policy to manage our exposure to the risks of our natural gas and ngl businesses 
the objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk  defined as remaining within the position levels established by the general partner 
we enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short term less than days and long term basis not to exceed months 
at december   we had open commodity financial instruments that settle at different dates through december the general partner oversees our strategies associated with physical and financial risks  approves specific activities subject to the commercial policy including authorized products  instruments and markets and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy 
we assess the risk of our commodity financial instruments portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model 
the sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie  the change in fair value of the portfolio based on a hypothetical movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the table 
in general  we derive the quoted market prices used in the model from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges ex 
nymex for instruments of similar duration 
in those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted  we employ regression analysis techniques possessing strong correlation factors 
the sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions 
the current quoted market price of natural gas  
the current quoted market price of ngls  
changes in the composition of commodities hedged ie  the mix between natural gas and related ngls  
fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged for both natural gas and related ngl hedges outstanding  
market interest rates  which are used in determining the present value  and 
a liquid market for such financial instruments 
an increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments based upon the factors and assumptions noted above approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table 
conversely  a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss 
the sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate 
therefore  the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions  assuming 
the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  
the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term  and 
as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
we routinely review our open commodity financial instruments in light of current market conditions 
if market conditions warrant  some instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure 
when this occurs  we may enter into new commodity financial instruments to reestablish the hedge of the commodity position to which the closed instrument relates 
these commodity financial instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific guidelines of sfas no 
because of ineffectiveness 
a hedge is normally regarded as effective if  among other things  at inception and throughout the term of the financial instrument  we could expect changes in the fair value of the hedged item to be almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value of the financial instrument 
currently  the majority of our commodity financial instruments do not qualify as effective accounting hedges under the guidelines of sfas no 
 with the result being that changes in the fair value of these positions are recorded on the balance sheet and in earnings through mark to market accounting 
the use of mark to market accounting for these commodity financial instruments results in a degree of non cash earnings fluctuation that is dependent upon changes in the underlying commodity prices 
even though these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific guidelines of sfas no 
 we continue to view these financial instruments as economically hedging our commodity price risk exposure as this was the business intent when such contracts were executed 
this characterization is consistent with the actual economic performance of the contracts to date and we expect these financial instruments to continue to mitigate or offset commodity price risk in the future 
the specific accounting for these contracts  however  is consistent with the requirements of sfas no

at this date  our portfolio was primarily comprised of natural gas based hedging instruments that were negatively affected by the unusually high natural gas prices that occurred at the end of and beginning of at december   the value of the financial instruments outstanding at that time reflected a million asset primarily due to the moderation of natural gas prices 
the portfolio value was also affected  to a lesser degree  by periodic changes in the composition of commodities hedged and settlements of certain open positions 
at march   the value of the financial instruments outstanding at that time was a million liability primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices 
historical income or loss resulting from commodity hedging activities are a component of our operating costs and expenses as reflected in the statements of consolidated operations 
we recognized income of million of such income during fiscal  of which million was realized through cash settlement of the commodity hedges 
interest rate swaps 
our interest rate exposure results from variable rate borrowings from commercial banks and fixed rate borrowings pursuant to the senior notes and mbfc loan 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing interest rate swaps 
the objective of holding interest rate swaps is to manage debt service costs by converting a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
an interest rate swap  in general  requires one party to pay a fixed rate on the notional amount while the other party pays a floating rate based on the notional amount 
we believe it is prudent to maintain an appropriate mixture of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by identifying and measuring changes in interest rate exposure that impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities 
we use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including cash flow sensitivity analysis to estimate the expected changes in interest rates on future cash flows 
the general partner oversees the strategies associated with financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements 
our interest rate swap agreements were dedesignated as hedging instruments after the adoption of sfas no 
 therefore  the swaps are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
however  these financial instruments continue to be effective in achieving the risk management activities for which they were intended 
as a result  the change in fair value of these instruments will be reflected on the balance sheet and in earnings as a component of interest expense using mark to market accounting 
at december   we had three interest rate swaps outstanding having a combined notional value of million attributable to fixed rate debt with an estimated fair value of million an asset 
due to the early termination of two of the swaps  the notional amount and fair value of the remaining swap was million and million an asset  respectively  at december  we recorded million of income from our interest rates swaps during and million during the income recognized in from these swaps includes the million in non cash mark to market income at december  attributable to the sole remaining swap 
the remaining has been realized 
no mark to market income was recorded prior to the implementation of sfas no 
the fair value of the remaining swap at december  would increase to million if quoted market interest rates were to decline by  conversely  the fair value would decline to million if rates were to rise by 
for additional information regarding our interest rate swaps  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our fixed rate debt obligations aggregated million principal amount and had a fair value of million 
since these instruments are fixed interest rates  they do not expose us to risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase to approximately million if the respective yields to maturity for these debt obligations were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we elected to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity

on december   enron corp  or enron  nyse  symbol ene announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries were filing voluntary petitions for chapter reorganization with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
at the time of its bankruptcy filing  enron north america  a subsidiary of enron  was the counterparty to a number of our commodity financial instruments 
as a result  we established a million reserve for all amounts owed to us by enron 
the enron amounts were unsecured and the amount that we may ultimately recover  if any  is not presently determinable 
of the reserve amount established  million was attributable to various unbilled commodity financial instrument positions that terminate during the first quarter of currently  we do not anticipate any material change in this estimate 
at december   receivables and other current assets associated with our counterparties totaled million  net of the enron reserve 
of the million  million is with counterparties rated as investment grade by prominent rating agencies
