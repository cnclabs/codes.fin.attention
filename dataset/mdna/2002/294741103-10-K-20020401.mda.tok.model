item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this form k 
terms employed herein as defined terms  but without definition  shall have the meaning set forth in the notes to the financial statements 
during the year ended december   we completed the following key transactions acquired spieker by merger for approximately billion  issued billion of unsecured notes in two tranches  consisting of billion of notes due at an all in cost of and million of notes due at an all in cost of  increased the quarterly common share distribution from to per share  acquired three lafayette centre  an office building located in washington  dc consisting of approximately  square feet for approximately million  sold eight office properties  four parking facilities  a land parcel and an apartment property for approximately million  sold approximately million square feet of the industrial portfolio for approximately million  and redeemed all  outstanding series d preferred shares for approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation and the fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments  each of which we discuss below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if we incorrectly determine the collectibility of our revenue  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on going basis 
based on these reviews  we establish provisions  and maintain an allowance  for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and is netted against rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents the cumulative allowances less write offs of uncollectible rent  is netted against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets 
if we incorrectly estimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets under gaap  we are required to record at fair value any of our long lived assets that we have determined to be permanently impaired 
our long lived assets consist primarily of our investments in real estate and unconsolidated joint ventures  but we also have investments in preferred securities and notes receivable 
the fair value of our investments in real estate and unconsolidated joint ventures depends on the future cash flows from operations of the properties or joint ventures 
the fair value of our investments in preferred securities and notes receivable depends on the underlying fair value of the issuer 
in assessing potential impairment for our investments  we consider these factors 
if these factors result in a fair value that is less than our carrying value  an impairment may be recognized if we determine the loss to be permanent 
during  we recognized an impairment of approximately million on an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture that was subsequently sold 
also during  we recognized an impairment of approximately million on several investments in securities and other investments 
of this amount  securities and other investments with carrying values of million were entirely written off 
if we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts  our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets 
depreciation we compute depreciation on our properties using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building usually to unless the property is subject to a ground lease in which case of the acquisition cost is allocated to building 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and the determination of the useful life are based on management s estimates 
if we do not allocate appropriately to building or we incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties  our computation of depreciation will not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods 
fair value of financial instruments we are required to determine quarterly the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes 
we are also required quarterly to adjust the carrying values of interest rate swaps and caps  as well as the underlying hedged liability  to its fair value 
in determining the fair value of these financial instruments  we use third party quotations and internally developed models that are based on current market conditions 
for example  in determining the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes  we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government debt securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
the market spread estimate is based on our historical experience in obtaining either secured or unsecured financing and also is affected by current market conditions 
in determining the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps  we rely on third party quotations to adjust these instruments  as well as the hedged liability  to its fair value 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not turn out to be accurate 
spieker merger on july   spieker merged into equity office and spieker partnership merged into eop partnership 
the transaction  which was accounted for by the purchase method  valued spieker  including the outside interests in spieker partnership  at approximately billion  which included transaction costs  the assumption of approximately billion in debt and the issuance of million of our preferred shares valued at approximately million 
we paid approximately billion in cash and issued approximately million of our common shares  and eop partnership issued approximately million of its units to third parties  each valued at per common share unit 
the billion cash portion of the purchase price was financed using a combination of available cash and a new billion bridge loan facility that was entered into before the closing of the spieker merger 
the billion bridge loan facility had a term of days and an interest rate based on libor plus basis points 
the billion bridge loan facility was repaid in full with the net proceeds from the issuance of billion of unsecured notes in july and then terminated 
as a result of the spieker merger  we acquired office properties consisting of approximately million square feet  industrial properties consisting of approximately million square feet and several development properties 
we subsequently sold of the industrial properties that were acquired in the spieker merger for approximately million 
there was no gain or loss on the sale of these properties 
these industrial properties are located in california and oregon and consist of approximately million square feet 
shortly after completion of the spieker merger  we expanded our board of trustees from to members 
the new members are warren e 
spieker  jr  previous chairman of spieker  and craig g 
vought and john a 
foster  previous co chief executive officers of spieker 
cornerstone merger on june   cornerstone properties inc cornerstone merged into equity office and cornerstone properties limited partnership cornerstone partnership  cornerstone s operating partnership subsidiary  merged into eop partnership collectively  the cornerstone merger 
the transaction  which was accounted for by the purchase method  valued cornerstone  including the outside interests in cornerstone partnership  at approximately billion  which included transaction costs  the assumption of approximately billion in debt  the redemption of million shares of cornerstone preferred stock valued at per share  including accrued but unpaid dividends for a total of approximately million  the redemption of approximately million shares of cornerstone common stock valued at per share for a total of approximately billion  the issuance of approximately million common shares and the issuance by eop partnership of approximately million units each valued at per common share unit 
we financed the billion in cash from our credit facilities 
results of operations general the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of equity office as of december  and  and for the years ended december   and we receive income primarily from rental revenue from the office properties  including reimbursements from tenants for certain operating costs  from parking revenue from office properties and parking facilities including rental revenue from our stand alone parking facilities and from rental revenue from industrial properties 
as a result of the current slowdown in economic activity  there has been a decrease in our occupancy rates and a decline in rents for our office properties in most major markets in which we own properties 
at december   office properties in our top markets  in which approximately of our office properties based on square footage are located  were occupied compared to at december  office properties in our top five markets san francisco  boston  san jose  seattle and chicago  in which approximately of our office properties based on square footage are located  were occupied compared to at december   with the occupancy rates in our top five markets ranging from for office properties in san francisco to in boston 
average rents for new office leases for which the tenants have occupied the space during the relevant period for our entire portfolio  which may lag behind market rents because leasing decisions typically are made anywhere from one month to months prior to taking occupancy  were approximately per square foot for the quarter ended december   compared to per square foot for the quarter ended september  and per square foot for the quarter ended december  these declines  which vary by market  reflect the downward trend in market rents due to the continued slowdown in economic activity 
at december   leases for million square feet  including month to month leases  or of the office portfolio  will expire in we believe that it is too soon to draw any conclusions about where occupancy rates or market rents ultimately will stabilize 
further decreases in occupancy rates and or further declines in rents could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in subsequent periods 
in addition to the downward trends in occupancy and market rents  we have experienced an increase in the amount of uncollectible receivables relating to tenants in bankruptcy and tenants that are having financial difficulties 
although we have substantial collateral from many of our tenants  additional write offs may occur in subsequent periods 
future rental income may also be affected by early lease terminations 
in either of these circumstances  we may not be able to collect the full amount that was due under the leases and could incur additional cost in re leasing the space 
as a result of the terrorist acts on september   we have realized increased costs for property insurance and safety and security 
we believe that these increased costs will remain higher than similar costs incurred in previous periods for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of the office leases require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in these operating expenses over a base amount 
we believe a significant portion of any increase in these operating expenses will be offset by expense reimbursements from tenants 
below is a summary of our acquisition and disposition activity since january  the buildings and total square feet shown include properties we own in joint ventures with other partners and reflects the total square feet of the properties 
excluding the joint venture partners share of the square feet of these properties  we effectively owned million square feet of office space as of december  office properties industrial properties parking facilities total total buildings square feet buildings square feet garages spaces properties owned as of january    cornerstone merger  acquisitions  developments placed in service  dispositions   building remeasurements a  december    spieker merger   acquisitions  developments placed in service  dispositions    reclass from industrial to office   building remeasurements a  december     a building remeasurements during relate to the office properties and industrial properties acquired in the spieker merger 
the initial property count was based on a count prepared prior to the spieker merger by the former management of spieker 
we count our properties based on the actual number of buildings at the property  which is different than the method used by the former management of spieker 
primarily as a result of the spieker merger in july  the cornerstone merger in june and the disposition of certain properties  the financial data presented show significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period 
therefore  we do not believe our period to period financial data are necessarily comparable 
the following analysis shows changes attributable to the properties that were held during the entire period for the periods being compared the core portfolio and the changes in our aggregate total portfolio of properties the total portfolio 
as reflected in the tables below  property revenues include rental revenues  reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses  parking revenue and other property operating revenues 
property operating expenses include real estate taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance and other property operating expenses 
comparison of year ended december  to december  the table below represents selected operating information for the total portfolio and for the core portfolio consisting of office properties and five parking facilities acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  total portfolio core portfolio increase increase decrease change decrease change dollars in thousands property revenues       fee income    interest dividend income      total revenues       interest expense       depreciation and amortization       property operating expenses       ground rent       general and administrative    impairment on securities and other investments   impairment on assets held for sale   total expenses       income before income taxes  allocation to minority interests  income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures  net gain on sales of real estate  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle       income taxes      minority interests      income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures       net gain on sales of real estate      extraordinary items    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle   net income       property revenues less property operating expenses before interest  depreciation and amortization  ground rent and general and administrative expense       deferred rental revenue      lease termination fees       property revenues the increase in property revenues in the total portfolio is primarily due to the properties acquired in the spieker merger in and the cornerstone merger in the increase in property revenues in the core portfolio resulted primarily from an increase in rental rates and an increase in lease termination fees partially offset by the write off of uncollectible receivables and a decrease in occupancy 
the weighted average occupancy of the core portfolio decreased from at january  to at december   mainly due to tenant rollover at various properties where the space was not re leased due to the current slowdown in economic activity 
as a result of the current slowdown in economic activity  we have also experienced an increase in the amount of uncollectible receivables relating to tenants in bankruptcy and tenants that are having financial difficulties 
the amount of bad debts written off for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to million for the prior period 
although we have substantial collateral from many of our tenants  additional write offs may occur in subsequent periods 
included in property revenues are lease termination fees 
these fees relate to specific tenants  each of whom has paid a fee to terminate its lease obligations before the end of the contractual term of the lease 
although we have historically received such termination fees  there is no way of predicting the timing or amounts of future lease termination fees 
interest expense total portfolio interest expense increased from the prior period as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period  mainly as a result of the spieker merger and the cornerstone merger  partially offset by interest rate swap agreements which converted the fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate for a portion of our unsecured notes 
in addition  set forth below are additional statistics for the total portfolio relating to our interest expense during the periods total debt to total assets decreased to from  interest coverage ratio calculated as ebitda divided by interest expense  including our share of interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures increased to times from times  and weighted average interest rate decreased to from 
interest expense on unsecured notes and the line of credit are not reflected in the core portfolio 
depreciation and amortization total portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior period primarily as a result of the spieker merger in july  the cornerstone merger in june and capital and tenant improvements made during the periods 
core portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during the periods 
property operating expenses total portfolio property operating expenses increased mainly as a result of the spieker merger in and the cornerstone merger in core portfolio property operating expenses increased mainly as a result of increases in utilities of million consisting primarily of electricity expense  increases in repairs and maintenance of approximately million primarily due to higher wages and increases in contract services  increases in insurance expenses of approximately million due to higher premiums and an increase in real estate taxes of approximately million 
substantially all of the office leases require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in operating expenses over a base amount 
we believe a substantial portion of any future increase will be offset by expense reimbursements from tenants  which are included in property revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in the number of employees at the corporate and regional offices as a result of the spieker merger and the cornerstone merger 
although general and administrative expenses are subject to increase along with any increase in the size of the portfolio  it is also anticipated that economies of scale may be realized with future growth  should it occur 
impairment on securities and other investments and assets held for sale during  an impairment on securities and other investments of approximately million was recognized in connection with various investments and other assets 
the total impairment consisted of our investment in hq global workplaces  inc hq global series a convertible cumulative preferred stock the hq preferred stock  including accrued but unpaid dividends  of approximately million  our investments in several telecom  technology and advertising related companies  our investments in two full service business center joint ventures  and a portion of our investment in an internally developed software system 
during the latter part of  hq global was in default with respect to certain covenant and payment obligations under its senior and mezzanine indebtedness but received forbearance periods from both its senior and mezzanine lenders 
hq global was unable to restructure its indebtedness during these forbearance periods 
based on these circumstances and other factors  we determined that our investment in hq global was not recoverable and  therefore  we recorded a permanent impairment on of our investment 
subsequently  in march hq global filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as of december   hq global occupied approximately million square feet in our office properties 
the annualized rent  including expense reimbursements  for this space for is approximately million 
as of march  we do not know what impact  if any  that the hq global chapter bankruptcy filing will have on their leases with us 
our telecom  technology and advertising related investments and full service business center joint venture investments have been experiencing operating losses due  in part  to the current economic environment 
these investments were considered to be impaired based on their current fair value as compared to the carrying value 
the fair value of the investments was based on internally prepared valuations considering current economic conditions 
the impairments represent our entire investment in the respective assets  except for the internally developed software system  for which the impairment represented approximately one half of the investment 
these investments and the related impairment are reported under the corporate and other segment for segment reporting purposes 
during  an impairment on assets held for sale of approximately million was recognized in connection with the sale of the st 
louis parking garage located in st 
louis  missouri 
the property was sold in january the sales price less costs to sell was less than the carrying amount of the property as of december  we had a interest in the property and accounted for its investment using the equity method of accounting 
our share of the net income from the property is included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased for the total portfolio due to an increase in property revenues at several office properties and the acquisition of an interest in avenue of the americas office property in august net gain on sales of real estate net gain on sales of real estate increased due to the combined gross sales price in excess of book value at the time of disposition for the real estate assets sold in being more than the combined gross sales price in excess of book value at the time of disposition for the real estate assets sold in extraordinary items the million extraordinary loss in consisted of a million prepayment penalty and the write off of approximately million of unamortized mark to market adjustments relating to the prepayment of million of mortgage debt see item financial statements and supplementary data note related party transactions  subfootnote and the repayment of approximately million of mortgage debt on parking facilities sold

included in property revenues are lease termination fees 
these fees relate to specific tenants who have paid a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual term of their lease 
although we have historically experienced similar levels of such termination fees  there is no way of predicting the timing or amounts of future lease termination fees 
interest dividend income total portfolio interest dividend income increased primarily as a result of a million investment in may in hq preferred stock 
the hq preferred stock had an initial dividend rate of per annum  which increases by basis points each year through maturity in interest dividend income also increased as a result of a million investment in september in a mezzanine level debt position related to the sunamerica center office property 
our share of the face amount of the note is approximately million  bears interest at and matures august  we also earned interest from property disposition proceeds held in escrow accounts 
the amounts in escrow will be utilized for property acquisitions or returned to us 
interest expense total portfolio interest expense increased from the prior period as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period  mainly as a result of the cornerstone merger  and an increase in the weighted average interest rate 
in addition  the following additional statistics for each period for the total portfolio are as follows total debt to total assets increased to from  interest coverage ratio calculated as ebitda divided by interest expense  including our share of interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased to times from times  and weighted average interest rate increased to from 
core portfolio interest expense decreased from the prior period due to the paydown of mortgage debt on certain properties partially offset by the financing of park avenue tower and third avenue

core portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during the periods 
property operating expenses total portfolio property operating expenses increased mainly as a result of the cornerstone merger in core portfolio property operating expenses increased mainly as a result of increases in real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
real estate taxes increased approximately million due to higher property tax assessments 
other operating expenses increased approximately million primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance costs  increased utility costs and an increase in expenses at certain properties that were under development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in the number of employees at the corporate office as a result of the establishment of new revenue producing business groups and the hiring of additional personnel in other corporate groups  primarily the information technology group 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of hiring additional personnel due to the cornerstone merger  which was anticipated 
although general and administrative expenses are expected to increase along with any increase in the size of the portfolio  it is also anticipated that economies of scale will be realized with future growth  should it occur 
income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures increased for the total portfolio due to the acquisition of an interest in avenue of the americas office property in august and the partial sale of office properties in december and two office properties in june equity office retained an equity interest in these office properties that were partially sold and accounts for its remaining interests under the equity method of accounting

we expect that our line of credit will provide for funding of working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs as well as acquisitions and development costs 
our net cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties  the collectibility of rent from our tenants  the level of operating and other expenses  and other factors 
material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flow from operations 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service  capital improvements and non revenue enhancing tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our net cash flow from operations may affect the financial performance covenants under our line of credit and unsecured notes 
if we fail to meet any of our financial performance covenants our line of credit may become unavailable to us  or the interest charged on the line of credit may increase 
either of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to fund working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs  acquisitions and development costs 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
accordingly  we currently intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of common shares and preferred shares 
subject to the foregoing  we have established quarterly distribution rates which  if annualized  would be as follows annualized distribution security per share common shares preferred shares series a b c e f since our anticipated distributions will not allow us to retain sufficient cash to repay all of our debt as it comes due using only cash from operations  we will be required to repay maturing debt with proceeds from debt and or equity offerings

cash flows the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in item financial statements and supplementary data and is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below 
years ended december  and cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million to approximately million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was the net result of the receipt of approximately  million from operating activities  approximately  million used for investing activities consisting primarily of approximately  million used for the acquisition of spieker and approximately million used for capital and tenant improvements and lease acquisition costs and approximately million from financing activities 
years ended december  and cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million to approximately million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was the net result of the receipt of approximately million from operating activities  approximately  million used for investing activities consisting primarily of approximately  million used for the acquisition of cornerstone and approximately million used for capital and tenant improvements and lease acquisition costs and approximately million from financing activities 
market risk qualitative information about market risk our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates for those financial instruments 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating  investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt service  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions to shareholders and other cash requirements 
the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
we utilize certain derivative financial instruments at times to further reduce interest rate risk 
interest rate protection and swap agreements are used to convert some variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis  or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
quantitative information about market risk general interest and market risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates and equity prices and equity prices on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
interest rate risk debt as of december   total outstanding debt was approximately billion  of which approximately  million which includes million of unsecured notes effectively converted to a variable rate through interest rate swaps  or  was variable rate debt 
if market rates of interest on the variable rate debt increase by or approximately basis points  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on the variable rate debt decrease by or approximately basis points  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
if market rates of interest decrease by  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december   total outstanding debt was approximately billion  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
if market rates of interest on the variable rate debt increased by or approximately basis points  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would have decreased future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
if market rates of interest increased by  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would have decreased by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on the variable rate debt decreased by or approximately basis points  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would have increased future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
if market rates of interest decreased by  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would have increased by approximately million 
interest rate risk derivatives during the year ended december   we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge certain unsecured notes as summarized below 
in each case  we are the variable rate payer and the counterparty is the fixed rate payer 
the variable interest rate is based on various spreads over libor 
the settlement dates correspond to the interest payment dates of the respective unsecured notes being hedged 
each of the interest rate swap agreements terminate on the maturity date of the respective unsecured notes being hedged 
maturity date amount estimated fixed of unsecured date hedged value interest rate notes swaps dollars in thousands june million july million october million  october million  october million  december million  values are as of december   and may fluctuate based on market interest rates 
in september  eop partnership terminated the interest rate swap agreement on these notes 
the total proceeds as a result of the termination that were recorded as additional premium on the million of unsecured notes were approximately million 
this amount is being amortized over the remaining term of the unsecured notes 
in september  eop partnership terminated the interest rate swap agreement on these notes 
the total proceeds as a result of the termination that were recorded as additional premium on the billion unsecured notes were approximately million 
in february  eop partnership terminated the interest rate swap agreement on these notes 
the total proceeds as a result of the termination that were recorded as additional premium on the billion unsecured notes were approximately million 
in accordance with fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the above interest rate swap agreements and the respective unsecured notes are reflected at market value 
any market adjustment on the swap agreements will be reflected in other assets or other liabilities  and the corresponding market adjustment on the unsecured notes will be reflected as either a discount or premium on unsecured notes 
because the swap agreements are considered a perfectly effective fair value hedge  there will be no effect on net income from the mark to market adjustments 
market rate risk in august  we had put option agreements outstanding in connection with the acquisition of certain properties in we paid approximately million in settlement of this put option 
we previously recognized approximately million as a total potential payment for the put option exercise between the period from august to august the difference of approximately million between the million previously recognized and the million actually paid was recognized as a put option settlement during the third quarter during  we recorded a permanent impairment on our investment in marketable securities and reduced the carrying value to a nominal amount  which approximates the current market value 
a increase or decrease in the market price of these securities would increase or decrease our investment in these securities by approximately million 
changes in the market prices of these securities are required to be reflected as a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december  and  we had an unrealized holding loss on these investments totaling approximately million and million  which is reflected as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
there will be no impact on earnings or cash flows from market price fluctuations unless we dispose of these investments or write down the investments upon the determination that these investments have suffered a permanent impairment 
capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions capital improvements significant renovations and improvements which improve or extend the useful life of our properties are capitalized 
we categorize these capital expenditures as follows capital improvements improvements that enhance the value of the property such as lobby renovations  roof replacement  significant renovations for americans with disabilities act compliance  chiller replacement  elevator upgrades  and development and redevelopment costs include costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property including tenant improvements  leasing commissions  capitalized interest and operating costs incurred during completion of the property and incurred while the property is made ready for its intended use 
tenant improvements and leasing commissions costs related to the renovation  alteration or build out of existing second generation space  as well as related leasing commissions  are capitalized 
these tenant improvements may include  but are not limited to  floor coverings  ceilings  walls  hvac  mechanical  electrical  plumbing and fire protection systems 
we categorize tenant improvements and leasing commissions as follows revenue enhancing costs incurred on space which is vacant at the time of acquisition or has been vacant for nine months or more  and non revenue enhancing costs incurred in connection with the renewal or retenanting of currently leased space to maintain the revenue being generated by such space 
cost of improvements the table below details the costs incurred for each type of improvement 
these costs exclude similar costs incurred at unconsolidated joint ventures 
for the years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per square foot amounts capital improvements capital improvements    development and redevelopment costs    total capital improvements    the amounts shown below represent the total tenant improvement and leasing commissions for leases which commenced during the period  regardless of when such costs were actually paid  which is a more useful measure of the total tenant improvement and leasing commission costs for the periods presented 
tenant improvements and leasing commissions revenue enhancing    per square foot leased non revenue enhancing non revenue enhancing renewals    per square foot leased non revenue enhancing retenanted    per square foot leased total non revenue enhancing    per square foot leased the above information includes actual capital improvements incurred and tenant improvements and leasing commissions for leases which commenced during the year for the years ended  and the amounts included in the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the cash expenditures made during each of these years 
the differences between these amounts represent timing differences between the lease commencement dates and the actual cash expenditures as well as expenditures for corporate furniture  fixtures and equipment  software  leasehold improvements and other 
the reconciliation between the amounts above and the amounts disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows for the years ended december  dollars in thousands total capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions    timing differences    expenditures for corporate furniture  fixtures and equipment  software  leasehold improvements and other    total capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions on the consolidated statements of cash flows    the table below details our share of the costs incurred for each type of improvement for unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per square foot amounts capital improvements capital improvements    development and redevelopment costs    tenant improvements and leasing commissions revenue enhancing   per square foot leased non revenue enhancing non revenue enhancing renewals   per square foot leased non revenue enhancing retenanted   per square foot leased total non revenue enhancing   per square foot leased developments we currently own directly and through joint ventures several properties in various stages of development or pre development

for consolidated developments  the costs incurred and the total estimated costs are based on our effective ownership percentages 
the total project estimated costs represent of the estimated costs including any unaffiliated party s portion 
for unconsolidated developments  the effective ownership percentage represents our direct interest in the development and our interest in wilson equity office w eo 
equity office s costs incurred and total estimated costs are based on our effective ownership percentage 
the total project estimated costs represent of the estimated costs  including ours  wilson investors wi and any unaffiliated party s portions 
the total estimated costs and the total project estimated costs are subject to change upon  or prior to  the completion of the development and include amounts required to lease the property 
b a third party and we have entered into a joint venture agreement for the purpose of developing  constructing  leasing and managing water s edge phase i and a potential phase ii development 
the total cost for the development of phase i and land acquisition of phase ii is approximately million  which includes million allocated to the cost of the phase ii land parcel 
we plan to fund approximately million of the phase i total development costs  which consists of our of the equity component  and the balance in the form of preferred equity 
c wi and we entered into a joint venture agreement to form w eo for the purpose of developing  constructing  leasing and managing developments in northern california 
w eo is owned by us and by wi 
william wilson iii  a trustee of equity office  through his ownership of wi  owns approximately of w eo and approximately of any promote to which wi is entitled under the joint venture agreement 
we have agreed to loan up to million to wi for its required contribution to w eo at a return per annum 
the current outstanding balance of this loan as of december  is approximately million of principal and million of accrued interest 
we have created or anticipates creating joint ventures with w eo and  in certain cases  unaffiliated third parties for the development of various office properties 
the costs for these developments are expected to be funded by us and w eo in a ratio and in some cases by third parties as described within each development s respective operating agreement 
the board of trustees has also authorized us to negotiate and enter into an agreement with w eo providing for the extension of first mortgage financing to the ownership entities of each of these developments at the greater of or libor plus  generally maturing months after initial funding or earlier at our option in the event alternative financing sources are available on terms reasonably acceptable to wi and any unaffiliated investors 
the aggregate amount of any such financing would generally be capped at of budgeted construction costs 
in accordance with the w eo operating agreement  we are entitled  but not required  to purchase the w eo interest in each development subsequent to project stabilization 
d foundry square is a project with three sites currently under development  each of which has a separate joint venture structure 
our effective ownership percentages are approximately  and for sites i  ii and iv  respectively 
site iii is currently held as land available for development 
e in the second quarter a joint venture between equity office  w eo  other unaffiliated parties and us leased the ferry building from the city and county of san francisco  through its port commission the port 
under this lease  the port is paid a stated base rent 
in addition  once the lessee has received from the project a cumulative preferred return of prior to stabilization and after stabilization  then of the proceeds from the operation and ownership of the project are paid to the port as percentage rent 
the joint venture is redeveloping the ferry building in a manner to permit the use of federal rehabilitation tax credits historic tax credits 
since the original members of the joint venture could not take full advantage of the historic tax credits  in the fourth quarter  the joint venture admitted a new member who could do so 
this investor member will contribute approximately million in equity to fund a portion of the total project estimated costs for the project  and will receive a preferred return with an effective annual rate of approximately on its capital investment 
the investor member s interest in the joint venture is subject to put call rights during the sixth and seventh years after the ferry building is placed in service 
upon the purchase of the investor member s interest pursuant to the put call  it is estimated that the joint venture will retain approximately million of the capital contributed by the investor member  based on the formula to determine the purchase price for the investor member s interest and after taking into account the preferred return that will have been paid to the investor member by such time 
through the creation of a master lease  our effective ownership percentage in the net cash flow of the ferry building project is approximately  after the distribution of the preferred returns 
f under the terms of the ground lease  the ground lessor is entitled to share  in addition to ground rent  in proceeds from the operation and ownership of this development after a return to the lessee 
in addition to the developments described above  we own or have under option various land parcels available for development 
these sites represent possible future development of up to approximately million square feet of office space 
the development of these sites will be impacted by the timing and likelihood of success of the entitlement process  both of which are uncertain 
consolidated developments in process increased to approximately million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to developments acquired in the spieker merger and additional expenditures made during the period 
consolidated land available for development increased to approximately million at december  from million at december   primarily due to land acquired in the spieker merger 
subsequent event in  we formed a joint venture with wi  through its interest in w eo  and an unaffiliated party to develop  construct  lease and manage foundry square i  a  square foot office building located in san francisco  california which was scheduled to be completed in third quarter the building was pre leased to a single tenant 
in march  the tenant terminated its lease for million 
in march  we entered into contracts with our joint venture partners to acquire the land  improvements and partnership interests in foundry square i 
wi s share of the lease termination income and consideration for its joint venture interest is approximately million 
our share of the lease termination fee is approximately million and will be recorded as income in the first quarter in addition  wi repaid the current approximate million outstanding balance under a million loan commitment we previously made to wi and the accrued interest of approximately million 
the remaining amount that wi can draw under the million loan commitment is approximately million 
we had previously accounted for our investment in foundry square i under the equity method and will now consolidate our investment  which will be reflected as land available for development 
we are currently analyzing our investment opportunities in foundry square i  which may include future development or the sale of foundry square i 
impact of new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
statement eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  the requirements of statement are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  we adopted the standard  which had no material effect on equity office 
fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted the standard which had no material effect on equity office 
inflation substantially all of our office leases require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in real estate taxes except in the case of certain california leases  which limit the ability of the landlord to pass through to the tenants the effect of increased real estate taxes attributable to a sale of real property interests and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed increases in base rent or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we believe that the majority of inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
funds from operations we believe ffo  as defined by nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
the following table reflects the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands income before income taxes  allocation to minority interests  income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures  net gain on sales of real estate  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle    add deduct income taxes   income allocated to minority interests for partially owned properties excluding allocation of gain on sale of real estate of  in    income from investment in unconsolidated joint ventures    depreciation and amortization real estate related including our share of unconsolidated joint ventures    impairment on assets held for sale  put option settlement    preferred distributions  net    funds from operations    cash flow provided by used for operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred share distributions the white paper on ffo approved by nareit in march defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties which equity office believes includes impairments on properties held for sale  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in november  nareit issued a national policy bulletin effective january  clarifying the definition of ffo to include all operating results  both recurring and non recurring  except those defined as extraordinary under gaap 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of a company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions
