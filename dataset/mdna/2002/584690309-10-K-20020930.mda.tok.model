item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which are included in this report on form k 
certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
see risk factors that may affect future results in item in this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns  exchanges for expired product are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we do not provide any forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned within six to months of expiration and the customer is committed to accepting replacement product in exchange 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers so revenue is recorded upon sale to the wholesaler  net of estimated provisions 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have in the past made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following  i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the 
table of contents manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and iii significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first will perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july  we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  this change did not have a material affect on our financial statements 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
if we determine through the impairment process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial and income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the assets and liabilities are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established as a reduction of deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
during fiscal  a net deferred tax asset was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to certain net operating loss carryforwards attributable to our merger with ascent 
the annual utilization of the ascent net operating loss carryforwards is limited for tax purposes  and we have only recorded the amount expected to be recovered through managed care and medicaid reserves we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective programs 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these manage care patients using historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development  and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for research and development work which has been completed 
these up front payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 
our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products in which there is already an anda or nda available and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights  which are in the development phase and there is no assurance that the third party is required to perform additional research efforts  we expense such payments 
one of our collaborations includes an advance to a foreign public company that provides for the return of the funds in certain situations  which we believe has occurred with respect to a million amount paid to them 
in this situation  we assessed the contractual status of the arrangement with outside legal counsel  and evaluated the ability of this party to repay such amounts at june  to determine that no valuation allowance is required for the million 
should the financial condition of this party change in the future  or should the legal status of the arrangement be assessed ultimately in a different manner  future reserves may be required with respect to the 
table of contents recoverability of the amounts  and result in future charges 
the million amount is recorded in other current assets in our financial statements as of june  overview we are a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on developing and marketing drugs in the united states for the treatment of dermatological  pediatric and podiatric conditions 
we believe that annual us pharmaceutical sales in these markets exceed billion 
we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions including acne  fungal infections  asthma  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  eczema  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis  head lice and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
we derive a majority of our prescription volume from our core products 
we believe that the prescription volume of our core products will constitute the majority of the prescription volume for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the prescription volume related to our core products  individually or collectively  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
several of our core products are subject to generic competition currently or may be in the future 
each of our core products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by regulatory or competitive changes 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of our revenues has been recognized in the last month of each quarter 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by us could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
we estimate customer demand for our products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
these data are extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies  and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we observe trends from these data  and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production  underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our revenues are derived from four major drug wholesale concerns 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers  using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
rarely do wholesale customers provide us complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
there can be no assurance that these customers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid spot outages 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our products  consistent with a health care provider s prescription 
because many of the our products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended prescribed medicis brand 
we 
table of contents believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
such availability strongly reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or influence greatly the purchasing patterns of wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of our major customers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given measurement period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of one or more of our products during the same measurement period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel  which are managed presumably in accordance with such customer s business practices 
we plan to spend substantial amounts of capital to continue the acquisition and research and development of pharmaceutical products 
actual expenditures will depend upon our financial condition  as well as the results of clinical testing  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  and strategic marketing decisions 
we may increase total expenditures for research and development and expect that research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
we periodically make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for research and development work which has been completed 
if there is no recourse provision against the third party for their failure to perform future services to earn such amounts paid  these up front payments are expensed at the time of payment 
payments made for product rights whereby the product has received regulatory approval for sale are capitalized and amortized over the expected revenue producing period 
to enable us to focus on our core selling and marketing activities  we selectively outsource certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as laboratory research  manufacturing  warehousing and distributing 
as we expand our activities in these areas  additional financial resources are expected to be utilized 
the duration of our manufacturing contracts vary in length 
certain transactions in fiscal the following transactions that occurred during fiscal were significant events that affected our results of operations  our cash flows  and our financial condition sale of million contingent convertible notes on june  and june   we sold million aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible notes due in private transactions 
approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of these notes was used to repurchase million shares of our class a common stock  with the remainder to be used for repurchase of additional shares of our class a common stock  potential acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable on june and december of each year  beginning on december  we also will pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period  with the initial six month period commencing june   if the average trading price of the notes reaches certain thresholds 
the notes will mature on june  we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after june   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus contingent interest  if any 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on june   and  and upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase  plus contingent interest  if any  payable in cash 

table of contents the notes are convertible  at the holders option  prior to the maturity date into shares of our class a common stock in the following circumstances during any quarter commencing after june   if the closing price of our class a common stock over a specified number of trading days during the previous quarter is more than of the conversion price of the notes on the last trading day of the previous quarter 
the notes are initially convertible at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  if we have called the notes for redemption  during the five trading day period immediately following any nine consecutive day trading period in which the trading price of the notes per  principal amount for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our class a common stock on that day multiplied by the number of shares of our class a common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
the notes  which are unsecured  do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and do not contain any financial covenants 
we incurred million of fees and other origination costs related to the issuance of the notes 
we are amortizing these costs over a five year period 
merger with ascent pediatrics  inc on november   we completed our merger with ascent  purchasing all of the outstanding capital stock and retiring the indebtedness of ascent for consideration of approximately million in cash plus up to an additional million per year for each of the first five years following closing based upon reaching certain sales threshold milestones on the ascent products for each twelve month period ending november  the fixed purchase price of million was allocated among ascent s assets  including trademarks  core technology  in process research and development and goodwill  based on an independent valuation analysis performed by a firm other than our independent auditors 
the contingent portions of the purchase price will be added to goodwill when and if threshold milestones have been achieved or at such time that a payment is deemed to be probable 
as of june   the first year threshold had been deemed to be probable  and million was recorded as additional goodwill 
we additionally incurred approximately million of costs related to the transaction  consisting of approximately million of professional services  including finder fees  million of severance costs and million of other costs 
these costs were treated as additional direct costs of acquisition and capitalized 
after being assimilated into medicis  ascent focuses on the marketing and selling of prescription products to us based pediatricians 
ascent s portfolio of pediatric specialty pharmaceutical products currently includes orapred prednisolone sodium phosphate  an oral liquid steroid for children with asthma and other respiratory inflammatory conditions  primsol trimethoprim hci  an antibiotic oral solution for children with acute otitis media  or middle ear infections  and pediamist  an over the counter saline nasal mist  as well as certain products that are under development 
sales of orapred comprise the majority of the ascent product sales 
ascent currently supports these products with a dedicated sales force  numbering approximately sales representatives and sales management 
the sales force now also markets other core dermatology products to pediatric physicians 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with sfas no 
 and accordingly  the results of ascent s operations are included in our consolidated results from the date of the merger 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

there can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues net revenues during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal our net revenues increased during fiscal primarily as a result of growth in sales of the loprox  omnicef  orapred  plexion  triaz and buphenyl products 
fiscal did not include revenue for omnicef and orapred 
non dermatological products increased from of total net revenues in fiscal to of total net revenues in fiscal this increase was due to the addition of orapred during fiscal from the merger with ascent 
gross profit gross profit during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to sales of the loprox  omnicef  orapred and plexion products  which have higher gross profit percentages than some of our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ascent sales force  increases in personnel costs related to the hiring or additional full time equivalent employees  primarily performing selling and marketing functions  and yearly salary escalations for existing employees 
this increase was also due to promotional costs associated with the sampling and advertising of our products  including orapred which was added to our line of products as a result of the ascent merger 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased percentage points  to from during fiscal  primarily due to the assimilation and ramp up of the ascent sales force 
research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to million paid during fiscal to corixa for a development  commercialization and license agreement for a novel psoriasis immunotherapeutic product as compared to million paid to aaipharma in june for the development  commercialization and license of a key dermatologic product 
we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of development projects and the funds available to support these projects 
in process research and development expense we recorded a million charge to operations for in process research and development during fiscal as part of the allocated purchase price related to the ascent merger 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was based on an independent valuation of ascent s completed and in process technologies performed by a firm other than our independent auditors and was charged to current operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the million charge is non deductible for tax purposes 
we did not 
table of contents record any charge to operations for in process research and development during fiscal during fiscal we incurred minimal expenditures with respect to the acquired product rights as a development plan was formalized 
future expenditures with respect to the development project are estimated to be up to million 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million in fiscal included in amortization expense during fiscal was the amortization of intangible assets related to the omnicef licensing agreement that we entered into with abbott laboratories in may this increase in amortization was offset by a  decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets whose useful lives were reviewed in the first quarter of fiscal and extended from years to years 
these changes in useful lives were based on management s belief that the products related to these intangible assets have longer useful lives than originally estimated 
operating income operating income during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal operating income during fiscal included a charge to operations of million for in process research and development relating to the ascent merger and a million payment to aaipharma for a research and development collaboration 
operating income during fiscal included a million payment to corixa for a research and development collaboration 
interest income interest income during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to the overall decrease in interest rates and a change in our investment mix to non taxable securities 
the increase in our cash available for investment due to the issuance of our contingent convertible senior notes occurred near the end of our fiscal year and therefore did not have a significant effect on fiscal s interest income 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to one month of interest expense related to our contingent convertible senior notes that were issued in june  offset by a million reduction related to a product line acquisition obligation that was fully paid during the year 
going forward  we will accrue interest expense related to the notes of approximately million in each quarter exclusive of any contingent interest that may become payable beginning in 
income tax expense income tax expense during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal the effective tax rate during fiscal was  as compared to during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the million charge that we recorded for in process research and development related to the ascent merger  which is non deductible for tax purposes 
the effective rate is lower than expected federal and state income tax rates due to approximately million of tax exempt interest income in both and  and contributions to charitable programs that receive favorable tax treatment 
net income net income during fiscal increased approximately million  to million from million during fiscal 
table of contents this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes and gross profit  offset by an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues net revenues during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal our net revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to the addition of sales of our plexion and plexion ts product lines  increases in sales of the lustra products  as well as the addition of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal of our new alustra product and increases in sales of our loprox and triaz products 
gross profit gross profit during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit was and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gross profit increased during fiscal primarily as a result of revenue associated with the loprox  lustra  plexion  plexion ts and buphenyl products  which have higher gross profit percentages than our other products 
amortization of related intangible assets is not included in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased percentage points  to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs  which resulted from an increase in the number of employees to in fiscal from in fiscal  and yearly salary escalations for existing employees 
the increase was also due to variable costs commensurate with increased sales volumes 
research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to million paid to corixa for a development  commercialization and license agreement for a novel psoriasis immunotherapeutic product 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the intangible assets related to the minocycline anda that we acquired in september operating income operating income during fiscal decreased million  to million from million during fiscal primarily due to the million payment to corixa for a research and development collaboration 

table of contents interest income interest income during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances during fiscal our higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances were primarily due to cash generated from operations  offset by the third payment of million paid in november to aventis  as successor in interest to hmr  relating to the license of the loprox  topicort and a t s products 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal decreased million  to million from million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the contract obligation recorded in connection with the license of the loprox  topicort and a t s products 
income tax expense income tax expense during fiscal decreased million  to million from million during fiscal the decrease in income tax expense was due to a decrease in pre tax income  which resulted from the million paid to corixa for a research and development collaboration 
the decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal  as compared to during fiscal  was primarily attributable to a change in investment mix to non taxable securities  contributions to charitable programs that receive favorable tax treatment and an increase in our research and development credits 
the effective rate is also lower than expected federal and state income tax rates due to approximately million and million of tax exempt interest in and  respectively 
net income net income during fiscal decreased approximately million  to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to an increase in strategic operating expenses and research and development expenses  offset by an increase in sales volume and interest income 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increase of our net income  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities and a decrease in the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options due to a decrease in exercise activity during fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the purchase of available for sale investments during fiscal  net of a payment of million made in connection with the ascent merger and the final million payment under the contract for the acquisition of the loprox  topicort and a t s products 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million  to million from million during fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of our million contingent convertible senior notes  offset by the purchase of million of treasury stock 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million at june   as compared to million and million  respectively  at june  these increases were primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of our million contingent convertible senior notes  offset by the million of treasury stock purchased throughout the fiscal year
