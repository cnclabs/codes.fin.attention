item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and information relating to forward looking statements and in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated operating data for the company as a percentage of net sales 
relationship to net sales fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings sales by operating segment for fiscal  and were as follows increase in thousands decrease versus versus segment north american    international    tactica   n a operating income loss by operating segment for fiscal  and was as follows increase in thousands decrease versus versus segment north american    international tactica   corporate other   results of operations consolidated sales and gross profit margins net sales for the months ended february  fiscal improved percent or  versus the month period ended february  fiscal 
all three of our operating segments exceeded their prior year sales totals  with the tactica operating segment producing  of the fiscal sales increase 
the international operating segment was responsible for most of the remaining sales growth 
net sales for fiscal increased percent or  compared to the months ended february  fiscal 
increased north american sales and the addition of the sales of tactica contributed most of the fiscal sales growth 
sales in our international segment also improved during fiscal  versus fiscal excluding the tactica segment  which was acquired in fiscal  we achieved net sales growth of percent in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of sales  for fiscal improved from to percent 
most of this increase was attributable to tactica s higher sales 
tactica s net revenues made up percent of our consolidated fiscal net sales  versus percent in fiscal  thus increasing the effect of its relatively high gross margins on consolidated gross margins 
north american segment gross margins also improved from fiscal to fiscal  primarily because of a favorable change in the mix of products sold and our ability to source product more efficiently 
gross profit as a percentage of sales rose from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the sales of tactica contributed significantly to the increase in gross profit 
additionally  gross profit for fiscal was reduced by a  pre tax charge for the write down of the company s artificial nails inventory 
the absence of such a charge in fiscal contributed to that year s improved gross profit as a percentage of sales 
slightly lower gross margins on some of the company s other north american and international products partially offset factors that increased fiscal gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal  selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased from to percent 
tactica incurs substantially higher sg a  as a percentage of its sales  than do the north american and international segments because of its more extensive use of infomercials and other forms of advertising 
because tactica grew significantly during fiscal  both in its sales volume and as a percentage of our consolidated business  all of its operating statistics  including sg a as a percentage of sales  became much more significant to our overall results 
this was the primary reason for higher sg a  as a percentage of sales  during fiscal although its sg a percentage was higher than the percentages incurred by the other segments  tactica s sg a declined as a percentage of its sales from fiscal to fiscal the main reason for the decline was a drop in tactica s fixed expenses as a percentage of its increased sales 
the variable portion of tactica s sg a expense rose slightly as a percentage of sales  mainly because of higher advertising expense 
excluding tactica  our fiscal sg a as a percentage of sales was consistent with fiscal  as lower media advertising expenses largely offset slightly higher personnel  insurance  and inventory storage costs 
sg a as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in fiscal  from percent in fiscal excluding tactica  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal two factors contributed significantly to the decrease 
first  because of fiscal sales growth  fixed expenses represented a smaller percentage of sales in fiscal than in fiscal second  in fiscal  we recognized more net expense than in fiscal in connection with the discontinuance of certain product lines and certain organizational changes 
in fiscal  we incurred  in pre tax sg a expenses related primarily to the discontinuance of our artificial nails business and also to other charges associated with strategic reorganizations of certain operations 
in fiscal  the company recognized a charge for the discontinuance of a product line  combined with a benefit from the settlement of a license obligation which  when combined  resulted in a net  charge to fiscal sg a 
partially offsetting the sg a items that decreased in fiscal were higher media advertising expenditures in the north american segment and the higher levels of sg a incurred by tactica  relative to our other segments 
north american segment the north american segment sells hair care and other personal care and comfort appliances  hairbrushes  combs  and utility and decorative hair accessories in the us and canada 
the north american segment s main customers are mass merchandisers  drug chains  warehouse clubs  grocery stores  and beauty supply retailers and wholesalers 
north american segment sales remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal  increasing by less than one percent 
in the retail distribution channel  our new line of ion hair care appliances and our private label products produced sales increases 
slight decreases in sales of some of our branded hair care and personal care appliances  as well as lower sales of brushes  combs and accessories offset partially the sales increases 
sales in the north american professional distribution channel grew mainly because of new product introductions and the expansion of some of our larger customers in this channel of distribution 
the weakness of the us economy in fiscal  relative to the recent past  contributed to a difficult north american sales environment 
we believe that new product introductions  strong positioning of our current products  and a healthier us economy should lead to fiscal north american segment sales growth in all product categories and distribution channels 
the increase in the company s fiscal north american sales  compared to fiscal  was largely due to the internal development of new products and sales of a new product line 
the company introduced new quiet hair dryers  a new line of halogen hair care appliances  and a new line of personal spa products  including paraffin baths  during fiscal additionally  sales of home hair clippers and trimmers under the sunbeam r and oster r names helped the company achieve increased sales in the north american segment during fiscal fiscal was the first year in which the company sold hair clippers and trimmers 
sales of certain brush  comb and accessory products declined in fiscal  partially offsetting the sales growth produced by the segment s other products 
operating income generated by the north american segment increased percent in the fiscal year ended february   compared to the same period a year earlier 
expressed as a percentage of sales  the north american segment s operating income rose from percent to percent from fiscal to fiscal the improved north american operating results were primarily the result of higher gross profit margins  arising from favorable changes in the mix of products sold and our ability to source product more efficiently 
fiscal north american segment operating income increased by percent over fiscal operating income in the north american segment totaled percent of net sales in that segment during fiscal  versus percent during fiscal during fiscal  we recognized  in non recurring expenses related to the discontinuance of the artificial nails product line and strategic reorganizations of some of our north american operations 
by contrast  in fiscal  we recognized net expenses of a non recurring nature totaling  international segment the international segment sells hair care and other personal care and comfort appliances  hairbrushes  combs  and utility and decorative hair accessories outside of the us and canada 
the international segment  like the north american segment  sells primarily to mass merchandisers  drug chains  warehouse clubs  grocery stores  and beauty supply retailers and wholesalers 
increased sales in latin and south america  france  and the united kingdom uk drove international segment sales up percent during fiscal the growth in latin america and south america was attributable to our successful efforts to increase distribution by expanding our customer base in that geographic area 
the net sales increase in france was due both to the development of relationships with a larger number of customers and the growth of our business with existing customers 
expanded sales to some of our larger customers in the uk drove sales increases there 
higher sales in latin and south america  particularly in brazil  were the primary factor increasing international sales during fiscal  relative to fiscal sales in germany and france also grew in fiscal our international segment incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal  compared to operating income of  in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced collection difficulties with a customer in the latin and south american market  as well as several customers in the middle east 
we are currently exploring strategies that might reduce our credit risk in the latin and south american market 
such strategies will result in lower latin and south american sales volume during the first quarter of and possibly throughout fiscal in addition to collection difficulties  inventory markdowns and currency exchange losses contributed to the international segment s operating loss 
the international segment s operating profit declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease in international operating income was largely the result of foreign exchange losses  as the us dollar gained substantial strength against foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling during fiscal tactica segment we own a percent ownership interest in tactica international  inc tactica 
tactica sells a variety of personal care and other products to retailers and to individuals 
tactica uses infomercials and other forms of advertising extensively 
as a result  tactica incurs higher sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  than the north american and international operating segments 
at the time that we acquired tactica  we determined that use of the purchase method of accounting and consolidation was appropriate and we continue to use that method of consolidation 
tactica had accumulated a net deficit at the time that we acquired our interest in it and the minority shareholders have not adequately guaranteed their portion of the accumulated deficit 
therefore  our consolidated statements of income for fiscal and fiscal include percent of tactica s net income and loss  respectively 
we will continue to recognize all of tactica s net income or loss until such time as tactica s accumulated deficit is extinguished 
after that time  our consolidated net earnings will include percent of tactica s net income or loss 
we anticipate that tactica s accumulated deficit will be extinguished during the quarter ending august  during fiscal  tactica s net revenues increased to over four times their fiscal levels 
tactica s line of epil stop r hair removal products played the most significant role of any product in its fiscal sales increase 
the electrosage tm muscle stimulation exercise product line and its new twist a braid tm hair styling accessory also contributed to higher fiscal sales 
the tactica segment is selling epil stop r  electrosage tm and twist a braid tm to retailers and through direct response media 
tactica s operating income of  in fiscal was a  improvement over its fiscal operating loss of  tactica s improvement in net sales was the primary factor leading to its better operating results in fiscal higher fiscal revenues produced more gross profit for tactica and caused its sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  to decrease 
as discussed above  tactica s net sales grew substantially in fiscal from fiscal  comprising percent and five percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated net sales during such periods 
in addition  the increase in tactica s sales in fiscal accounted for percent of the increase in our consolidated sales during this period 
tactica s sales in fiscal were comprised heavily of the epil stop r product line  which has an unproven product life cycle 
tactica also sells other products that have short life cycles 
furthermore  tactica relies on television infomercials and direct response marketing campaigns for the marketing of its products 
accordingly  tactica s sales may be more volatile than the business of our other two segments 
the results of our business could be adversely affected by decreases in sales of tactica products 
interest expense and other income expense interest expense increased by percent  or  in fiscal  versus fiscal  due to increased borrowings under our line of credit during the first three quarters of fiscal the increase in borrowings was due to our relatively high levels of inventory purchases early in the year 
such purchases enabled us to obtain products from suppliers at favorable prices 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the capitalization of interest on the construction of our new us office building during the first two quarters of fiscal lowered interest expense for that year 
no interest was capitalized during fiscal other income decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was a drop in income from the sale and appreciation of marketable securities from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest income also fell because of lower interest rates and because of lower cash balances for most of fiscal  versus fiscal other income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal lower income from the sale and appreciation of marketable securities accounted for most of this decrease 
income from the sale and appreciation of marketable securities was approximately  in fiscal  versus  for fiscal income tax expense in fiscal our income tax expense was percent of net income before income taxes  as opposed to percent in fiscal the main reason for this change was tactica 
tactica incurs a total income tax rate of approximately percent  versus percent for our other two segments combined 
because tactica produced net income during fiscal  our effective tax rate rose above percent 
the removal during fiscal of a valuation allowance from a  deferred tax asset reduced tactica s income tax expense below percent for the fiscal year 
fiscal income tax expense totaled  or percent of earnings before income taxes  versus a tax benefit of  in fiscal on  in earnings before income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for each of fiscal and fiscal was reduced below rates of approximately percent that it had experienced prior to fiscal during both fiscal and fiscal  the company s tax rate was reduced by the fact that helen of troy limited  the bermuda corporation  which is not subject to any capital gains or other income tax  holds the consolidated group s investments in marketable securities 
in addition  the charges associated with the company s discontinuance of its artificial nails product line created tax benefits on the books of a us subsidiary that offset much of the tax expense associated with the income of non us subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we substantially strengthened our financial condition 
our cash balance increased  while our inventory balance decreased 
in addition  at february  we had no borrowings outstanding on our working capital line of credit  versus a  balance on the same date a year earlier 
our cash balance increased percent to  at february   compared to  at february  operating activities provided  of cash during fiscal  compared to using  during the previous fiscal year 
in addition to net income  our successful efforts to reduce inventory balances were instrumental in the production of cash from operating activities 
investing activities used  due primarily to our prepayment of approximately  in royalties on an international royalty agreement 
financing activities used  mainly because we began the year with  borrowed under our line of credit and reduced that amount to zero by the end of fiscal net accounts receivable increased percent from february  to february  the percentage increase in accounts receivable is substantially less than the percent increase in net sales that we achieved during fiscal the fiscal growth in tactica s cash sales to consumers  relative to total net sales  was the primary reason that accounts receivable grew by a smaller percentage than net sales 
our february  inventory balance totaled  versus  at february   a percent decrease 
after making substantial purchases during the first half of fiscal in order to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers  we engaged in a successful effort to reduce our inventory levels mainly by curtailing inventory purchases in the second half of fiscal our working capital balance increased to  at february  from  at february  our current ratio was at february   compared to at february  the increase in our current ratio was largely due to the production of cash by our operating activities  lower levels of accounts payable  and the repayment of borrowings under the working capital line of credit in fiscal the decrease in accounts payable is primarily the result of lower levels of inventory purchases 
in connection with its acquisition of a percent interest in tactica  the company loaned  to the minority shareholders of tactica 
the interest rate on these loans is percent 
all principal and unpaid interest on these loans is due march  the total amounts of principal and accrued interest due to the company under these loans were  and  at february  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a revolving credit loan with a bank to facilitate short term borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit 
this line of credit allows borrowings totaling  incurs interest at the three month libor rate plus a percentage that varies based on the ratio of the company s debt to its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  and expires august  at february  the interest rate charged under the line of credit was percent 
this line of credit allows for the issuance of letters of credit up to  any outstanding letters of credit reduce the  maximum borrowing limit on a dollar for dollar basis 
at february   there were no borrowings under this line of credit and outstanding letters of credit totaled  the revolving credit agreement provides that the company must satisfy requirements concerning its minimum net worth  total debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio  debt to ebitda ratio and its fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company is in compliance with all of these requirements 
our  of long term debt is comprised of a group of unsecured senior notes with face values totaling  and an interest rate of percent  as well as an unsecured senior note with a face value of  and an interest rate of percent 
we pay interest on these notes each calendar quarter 
the  group of senior notes require annual principal payments of  beginning january   with the final payment due january  the  senior note requires annual principal payments of  beginning july   with the final payment due july  the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to meet certain net worth and other financial requirements 
additionally  the senior notes restrict the company from incurring liens on any of its properties  except under certain conditions 
the company is in compliance with all the terms of these notes 
capital and license expenditures totaled   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
our operations are not typically capital intensive 
on a normal operating basis  we are likely to incur approximately  in capital expenditures annually 
in fiscal  capital expenditures included  of expenditures associated with the construction of our us office facility 
we incurred capitalized license fees of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
we are in the process of negotiating the renewal and modification of certain license agreements  which we expect to complete during fiscal at aggregate expenditures during fiscal of  our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  were payments due by period in s contractual less than obligations total year years years after years long term debt     open purchase orders inventory   minimum royalty payments      total contractual obligations      we do not engage in any activities involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
under a september board of directors resolution  the company may repurchase up to a total of  shares of its common stock over a period extending to september  since the inception of this common stock repurchase program  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock for  including commissions  or an average price per share of 
no common stock was repurchased during fiscal based on our current financial condition and current operations  we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund the company s ongoing liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our capital needs will stem primarily from the needs to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
in addition  we evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis and might augment our internal growth with acquisitions of complimentary businesses and product lines 
we might finance acquisition activity with available cash  the issuance of stock  or with additional debt  depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and upon conditions in the capital markets 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
preparation of our financial statements involves the application of several such policies 
these policies include consolidation of tactica international  inc tactica under the purchase method  estimates of our exposure to liability for income taxes in hong kong  estimates of credits to be issued to customers for sales that have already been recorded  the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and the valuation of inventory on a lower of cost or market basis 
consolidation of tactica in march fiscal  we acquired a percent interest in tactica 
at that time  we determined that use of the purchase method of accounting and consolidation was appropriate and we continue to use that method of consolidation 
because tactica had accumulated a net deficit at the time that we acquired our interest in it and because the minority shareholders of tactica have not adequately guaranteed their portion of the accumulated deficit  our consolidated statements of income for fiscal and fiscal include percent of tactica s net income or loss 
we will continue to recognize all of tactica s net income or loss until such time as tactica s accumulated deficit is extinguished 
after that time  our consolidated net earnings will include percent of tactica s net income or loss 
hong kong income taxes the inland revenue department the ird in hong kong assessed tax on certain profits of the company s foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through the ultimate resolution of the ird s claims cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  we have recorded a liability for the ird s claims  based on consultations with outside hong kong tax experts as to the probability that some or all of the ird s claims prevail 
such liability is included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
if the ird s position were to prevail and it were to assert the same position with respect to fiscal years after  the resulting tax liability could total  us for the period from fiscal through fiscal estimates of credits to be issued to customers we regularly receive requests for credits from retailers for returned product or in connection with sales incentives  such as co operative advertising and volume rebate agreements 
we reduce sales or increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the credits  for estimated future credits to customers 
our estimates of these amounts are based either on historical information about credits issued  relative to total sales  or on specific knowledge of incentives offered to retailers 
allowance for doubtful accounts from time to time  amounts due from our customers become uncollectible due to the customers inability to pay 
we record allowances specifically for customers balances based on the probability that we will not receive payment 
when major customers declare bankruptcy  we record an allowance equal to the amount due from that customer  less the portion of the receivable that we expect to collect either by selling the receivable in a secondary market or through settlement with the bankruptcy estate 
valuation of inventory we account for our inventory using a first in first out system in which we record inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of its cost or its net realizable value 
determination of net realizable value requires management to estimate the point in time at which an item s net realizable value drops below its cost 
we regularly review our inventory for slow moving items and for items that we are unable to sell at prices above their original cost 
when we identify such an item  we reduce its book value to the net amount that we expect to realize upon its sale 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
in addition to the above policies  several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  are important to the preparation of our financial statements  but do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgements 
risk factors competition 
the personal care and comfort products industry is extremely competitive 
maintaining and gaining market share depends heavily upon price  quality  brand name recognition  patents  innovation in the design of new products and replacement models  and marketing and distribution approaches 
we compete with domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than those of the company 
we believe that our ability to produce reliable products that incorporate developments in technology and to satisfy consumer tastes with respect to style and design  as well as our ability to market a broad offering of products in each applicable category at competitive prices  are keys to our future success 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully compete on the basis of these factors in the future 
dependence upon licenses and trademarks 
a substantial portion of our sales revenue is derived from sales of products under licensed trademarks 
as a result  we are materially dependent upon the continued use of such trademarks  particularly the vs sassoon r and revlon r trademarks 
actions taken by licensors and other third parties could diminish greatly the value of any of our licensed trademarks 
if we were unable to sell products under these licensed trademarks the effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could be both negative and material 
income taxes 
currently  we benefit from an international corporate structure that results in relatively low tax rates on a consolidated basis 
if we were to encounter significant changes in the rates or rules imposed by certain key taxing jurisdictions  such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and profitability 
in  we engaged in a corporate restructuring that  among other things  resulted in a greater portion of our income not being subject to taxation in the us if such income were subject to us federal income taxes  our effective income tax rate would increase materially 
several bills have been introduced recently in the us congress that  if enacted into law  could adversely affect our us federal income tax status 
at least one of the bills introduced would apply to companies such as ours that restructured several years ago 
that bill could  if enacted into law  subject a greater portion of our income to us income taxes  thereby reducing our net income 
other bills introduced recently would exempt restructuring transactions  such as ours  that were completed before certain dates in and  but would limit the deductibility of payments made in certain intercompany transactions for us income tax purposes and would subject gains on certain asset transfers to us income tax 
in addition to the legislation introduced in congress  the us treasury department recently published a study of restructurings such as ours 
it is not currently possible to predict whether the legislation that has been introduced will become law  whether any additional bills will be introduced  or the consequences of the us treasury department s study 
however  there is a risk that new laws in the us could eliminate or substantially reduce the current income tax benefits of our corporate structure 
if this were to occur  such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to potential changes in tax laws  the company s position on various tax matters may be challenged  as is the case with the hong kong inland revenue department matter discussed in item legal proceedings 
our ability to maintain our position that the parent company is not a controlled foreign corporation as defined under the us internal revenue code is critical to the tax treatment of our non us earnings 
a controlled foreign corporation is a non us corporation whose largest non us shareholders non us  those owning ten percent or more of its stock together own more than percent of the stock in such corporation 
if a change of ownership of the company were to occur such that the parent company became a controlled foreign corporation  such a change could have a material negative effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn  on the company s business 
international manufacturing and operations 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in the far east 
risks associated with such foreign manufacturing include changing international political relations  changes in laws  including tax laws  regulations  and treaties  changes in labor laws  regulations  and policies  changes in customs duties and other trade barriers  changes in shipping costs  currency exchange fluctuations  local political unrest  and the availability and cost of raw materials and merchandise 
to date  these factors have not significantly affected our production in the far east 
however  any change that impairs our ability to obtain products from such manufacturers  or to obtain products at marketable rates  could have a material negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory 
because of our reliance on manufacturers in the far east  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
distribution difficulties may have an adverse effect on our business by increasing the amount of inventory and the cost of storing inventory 
additionally  changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make inventory management more difficult 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and result of operations 
newly acquired product lines and subsidiaries 
we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of new product lines and businesses 
the acquisition of a business or of the rights to market specific products or use specific product names involves a financial commitment 
in the case of an acquisition such commitments are usually in the form of either cash or stock consideration 
in the case of a new license  such commitments could take the form of license fees  prepaid royalties and future minimum royalty and advertising payments 
while our strategy is to acquire businesses and to develop products that will contribute positively to earnings  there is no guarantee of such results 
anticipated synergies may not materialize  cost savings may be less than expected  sales of products may not meet expectations  and acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities 
each of these factors could result in a newly acquired business or product line having a material negative impact on financial condition and results of operations 
reliance upon certain customers 
we are dependent on certain principal customers 
wal mart stores  inc  and one of its affiliates  accounted for approximately percent of the company s net sales in fiscal our top three customers accounted for approximately percent of fiscal net sales 
although we have long standing relationships with our major customers  no contracts require these customers to buy from us 
a substantial decrease in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
tactica s potential sales volatility 
tactica s net sales grew substantially in fiscal from fiscal  comprising percent and five percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated net sales during such periods 
in addition  the increase in tactica s sales in fiscal accounted for percent of the increase in our consolidated sales during this period 
tactica s sales in fiscal were comprised heavily of the epil stop r product line  which has an unproven product life cycle 
tactica also sells other products that have short life cycles 
furthermore  tactica relies on television infomercials and direct response marketing campaigns for the marketing of its products 
accordingly  tactica s sales may be more volatile than the business of our other two segments 
the results of our business could be adversely affected by decreases in sales of tactica products 
tactica stockholders agreement 
one of our subsidiaries is a party to a stockholders agreement with the former owners of tactica  who retained a percent interest in tactica collectively the other tactica stockholders 
under the terms of the stockholders agreement  we have been granted the right to initiate a process whereby we can purchase  and the other tactica stockholders are required to sell  the shares they own 
in addition  the other tactica stockholders have the right to initiate a process regarding the sale of their remaining interest in tactica 
we may elect at our option not to purchase the shares owned by the other tactica stockholders and under the terms of the stockholders agreement the parties will then be required to initiate a procedure under which the entire business of tactica would be offered for sale to third parties 
in either case  the purchase price will be based upon fair market value as determined by independent appraisal 
a sale to a third party would be subject to the approval of the other tactica stockholders and us 
in the event that either party exercises its rights under the stockholders agreement  our financial position and profitability could be adversely affected 
us and worldwide economic conditions 
adverse changes in economic conditions that affect consumer spending or worldwide economic conditions could have a material negative effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
information relating to forward looking statements certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company may constitute forward looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of this includes statements made in this report  in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in certain other oral and written presentations

new accounting guidance in april  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on eitf issue eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration from a vendor to a retailer 
eitf requires vendors who offer certain allowances to customers to characterize those allowances as reductions of net sales  rather than as selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
eitf is applicable for fiscal quarters beginning after december  and requires restatement of prior periods if possible 
had the company applied eitf its net sales and sg a in fiscal   and would have decreased by   and  respectively 
eitf will be applied beginning in fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives in its financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas was effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas is effective for the company beginning march  it eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives 
amortization will continue to be recorded for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
sfas also requires at least an annual impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets 
any asset deemed to be impaired is to be written down to its fair value 
in complying with sfas  we will review the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets to determine whether it is impaired 
we will determine fair values using discounted cash flow analysis 
we estimate that the cumulative effect of adopting sfas will be a non cash after tax charge ranging from million to million in the first quarter of fiscal we will record this amount as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
because it eliminates the amortization of goodwill  sfas will decrease our sg a expense by approximately  in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates represent our primary financial market risks 
fluctuation in interest rates causes variation in the amount of interest that we can earn on our available cash 
our long term debt is at fixed rates ranging from percent to percent 
increases in interest rates do not expose us to risk on this debt 
however  as interest rates drop below the rates on our long term debt  our interest cost can exceed the cost of capital of other companies who are borrowing at lower rates of interest 
as mentioned in the liquidity and capital resources discussion  interest rates on our revolving credit agreement vary based on the three month libor rate and on our ratio of debt to ebitda 
therefore  the potential for interest rate increases exposes us to interest rate risk on our revolving credit agreement 
that agreement allows maximum borrowings of  at the end of fiscal  no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement 
however  if the need to borrow under the revolving credit agreement were to arise  higher interest rates would increase the cost of such debt 
we do not currently hedge against interest rate risk 
because we purchase a substantial majority of our inventory using us dollars  we are subject to minimal foreign exchange rate risk in purchasing inventory 
sales in countries other than the united kingdom  germany  and france are transacted in us dollars 
our sales in the united kingdom are transacted in british pounds and our sales in france and germany are invoiced in euros 
until january   we also transacted sales in france and germany in french francs and german marks  respectively 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact sales  we are exposed to foreign exchange losses on those sales because our foreign currency sales prices are not adjusted for currency fluctuations 
in fiscal  our gross sales in currencies other than the us dollar totaled approximately  converted at average monthly exchange rates 
our fiscal foreign currency exchange loss totaled  we do not currently hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
the transition in european countries from their local currencies to the euro on january  did not affect our business materially 
the effect of the transition for us is that sales that would previously have been invoiced in french francs or german marks are now invoiced in euros
