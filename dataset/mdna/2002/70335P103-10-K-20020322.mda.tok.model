non interest income 
total non interest income was  for compared to  for the increase was primarily due to an increased emphasis on recurring non interest income including loan and deposit fees offset by a decrease in atm fees which was primarily the result of discontinuing the operations of several atm machines at the end of non interest expense 
total non interest expense was  for compared to  for non interest expense in included  related to the resignation of patriot s former president and chief executive officer  a one time restructuring charge of  and non recurring expenses of  related to the restructuring of patriot s mortgage company and call center

patriot s primary loan products are commercial loans and leases  home equity loans on existing owner occupied residential real estate  and fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
patriot also offers residential construction loans and other consumer loans 
commercial lending 
patriot originates commercial loans with an emphasis on small businesses  professionals and entrepreneurs within patriot s local markets 
most of patriot s commercial loan relationships have exposure of  or less 
commercial loans are generally secured by real estate and personal guarantees 
commercial leasing 
patriot s subsidiary  patriot commercial leasing company pclc  is a small ticket commercial leasing company 
pclc originates leases to businesses predominantly located on the east coast 
transaction sizes generally range from  to  with the average transaction being less than  pclc is owned by patriot bank 
pclc s leases are considered financing leases for accounting purposes 
consumer lending 
patriot offers variable rate based upon prime rate home equity lines of credit and fixed rate home equity loans  which are generally secured by single family  owner occupied residential properties 
patriot also offers a variety of other consumer loans  which primarily consist of installment loans secured by automobiles  credit cards  unsecured lines of credit and other loans secured by deposit accounts 
mortgage lending 
patriot offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  primarily owner occupied  located in patriot s primary market area 
patriot generally underwrites its first mortgage loans in accordance with underwriting standards set by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fnma 
patriot also originates residential construction loans 
substantially all of the residential mortgage loans originated by patriot are sold into the secondary markets  therefore  patriot s mortgage loan portfolio consists mainly of seasoned mortgage loans originated prior to at december   patriot s total loan portfolio was  compared to a total loan portfolio of  at december  the decrease in the loan portfolio is primarily the result of patriot allowing mortgages to runoff  offset by an emphasis placed on increasing commercial lending and leasing relationships

there tends to be more deferred costs associated with originating commercial loans and leases as compared to originating mortgage loans  which have more deferred fees 
as a result  patriot s position transitioned from  in net deferred fees in to  in net deferred costs in loan maturity

patriot s asset review and credit administration committee establishes acceptable credit risks to be undertaken  the policies and procedures to be used to control credit risk and the corrective actions to be taken when credit challenges are encountered 
this committee also reviews credit quality on a monthly basis  classifies assets in accordance with applicable management guidelines and regulations and makes recommendations to patriot s board of directors with regard to placing assets on non accrual status  charge offs and write downs and the appropriate level of credit reserves 
patriot accrues interest on all loans until management determines that the collection of interest is doubtful 
in no event does patriot continue accruing interest on loans contractually past due days or more 
upon discontinuance of interest accrual  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
patriot generally requires appraisals on an annual basis on foreclosed properties 
patriot generally conducts inspections on foreclosed properties on at least a quarterly basis 
at december   non performing assets npas were  or of total assets compared to  or 
of total assets at december  although the ratio of non performing assets to total assets has grown during the past year  patriot s ratio of npas to total assets is generally better than the average of all banks in the mid atlantic region and better than the average for all us banks between billion 
patriot controls its level of non performing assets by quickly identifying problem assets and resolving them in an expedient manner

allowance for credit losses 
an allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon evaluation of individual loans and leases  the overall risk characteristics of the various portfolio segments  regression analysises using past loss experience  current and projected financial status and creditworthiness of its borrowers  the adequacy of collateral  the level and nature of non performing loans  current economic conditions  the results of the most recent regulatory examination and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective 
while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require patriot to recognize additions to the allowance for credit losses based on their judgments of information which is available to them at the time of their examinations 
patriot s total loans consist of four distinct portfolios 
each of which is monitored and analyzed seperately 
mortgage loans comprise of total loans 
the mortgage loan portfolio is seasoned as patriot has been in the mortgage lending business for many years and has sold substantially all new mortgage originations in the past two years 
the level of non performing assets in the mortgage portfolio has increased during the past two years 
management believes this increase can be attributed to the current recessionary phase of the credit cycle and a relatively low reference point in previous years balances 
patriot s mortgage loans are generally well collateralized and historically patriot has experienced minimal losses on these loans 
because of patriot s consistent history in mortgage lending and the long term nature of this portfolio  patriot predominately relies upon an internal regression analysis which uses historical data to estimate losses that are inherent in the portfolio 
consumer loans comprise of total loans and consist mostly of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit 
the consumer loan portfolio is also mature as patriot has been in consumer lending business for many years 
as with mortgage lending patriot predominantly uses an internal regression analysis which uses historical data to estimate losses that are inherent in the portfolio 
commercial loans comprise of total loans 
patriot entered the commercial lending business in and has grown the portfolio into a substantial portion of total loans 
patriot now has adequate historical data to prepare regression models to monitor trends of charge offs and recoveries and establish appropriate allowance levels 
patriot also closely monitors local economic and business trends relative to its commercial lending portfolio to estimate the effect those trends may have on potential losses 
patriot s commercial loan portfolio contains some loans that are substantially larger than the loans within other portfolios 
the potential loss associated with an individual loan could have a significant impact on the allowance and charge off levels at patriot 
therefore patriot closely monitors these loans and will specifically reserve for individual loans which exhibit weakness 
commercial leases comprise of total loans 
patriot entered the commercial leasing business in principally through the acquisition of keystone leasing 
patriot s leasing portfolio has a short  approximately year life 
patriot performs an internal regression analysis on this portfolio using historical data including keystone leasing data 
patriot also closely monitors regional and national economic business trends relative to its commercial leasing portfolio to estimate the effects those trend may have on potential losses 
patriot s percentage of loan loss reserves to total loans increased from 
in to 
in  which correlates to patriot s growth in its higher risk commercial loan and lease portfolios 
during patriot s loan and lease portfolios decreased from  at december   to  in  patriot implemented a strategy that focused on reducing the mortgage loan portfolio  which resulted in a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by a growth in patriot s commercial loan and lease portfolios 
based on the growth in the commercial loan and lease portfolios  management determined a provision of  was necessary to adequately address the risk inherent in patriot s loan and lease portfolios 
patriot believes that the allowance provided adequate coverage of potential credit losses at december  the following table sets forth management s allocation of the allowance for credit losses at the dates indicated at december percent of percent of percent of percent of loans in percent of loans in percent of loans in allowance each allowance each allowance each to category to category to category total to total total to total total to total amount allowance loans amount allowance loans amount allowance loans dollars in thousands commercial loans and leases    home equity and consumer residential mortgages  total valuation allowances    at december  percent of percent of percent of loans in percent of loans in allowance each allowance each to category to category total to total total to total amount allowance loans amount allowance loans dollars in thousands commercial loans and leases  home equity and consumer residential mortgages   total valuation allowances   cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at december   were  compared to  at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was temporary and primarily due to timing differences related to the repayment of borrowed funds 
securities 
investment securities consist of us treasury and government agency securities  corporate debt and equity securities 
mortgage backed securities consist of securities generally issued by either the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  federal national mortgage association fnma or the government national mortgage association gnma 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmos consist of securities issued by the fhlmc  fnma or private issuers 
total investment and mortgage backed securities at december   were  compared to  at december  the decrease in investment and mortgage backed securities is primarily due to the sale of  of investments during along with higher investment amortization and prepayments 
patriot adopted sfas on january  at the time of adoption  patriot reclassified approximately  of fixed rate mortgage backed securities  cmos and agency securities from held to maturity to available for sale and equity resulting in a net of tax increase of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the first quarter of  patriot sold  of the securities reclassified resulting in a cumulative change in accounting principle with a net after tax impact of a  loss 
patriot typically has not used derivative instruments and currently holds no positions that had further impact on earnings  financial condition or equity

other assets at december  were  compared to  at december  the decrease in other assets was primarily attributable to adjustments to patriot s deferred tax position related to unrealized gains on investments  tax reserves on investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
deposits 
deposits are generally attracted from within patriot s primary market area through the offering of various deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans 
patriot also solicits brokered deposits from various sources 
total deposits at december  were  compared to  at december  of that decrease   was related to wholesale deposits and  was related to retail certificates of deposits  offset by a  increase of core deposits 
the reduction in wholesale deposits was part of patriot s strategy to deleverage the balance sheet and reduce the dependence on wholesale funding 
the following table sets forth the distribution of average deposit accounts for the periods indicated and the weighted average yield on each category of deposit presented for the year ended december  percent percent percent of of of total weighted total weighted total weighted average average average average average average average average average balance deposits yield balance deposits yield balance deposits yield dollars in thousands money market deposits    savings deposits    now deposits    demand deposits    retail certificates of deposit    total retail deposits    jumbo certificates of deposit    total deposits    at december   the company had  in certificate of deposit accounts in amounts of  or more maturing as follows three months or less  over three through six months  over six through onths  over months  total  borrowings 
patriot utilizes borrowings as a source of funds for its growth strategy and its asset liability management 
patriot is eligible to obtain advances from the fhlb upon the security of certain loan portfolios  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
fhlb advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the maximum amount that the fhlb will advance to member institutions fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb 
patriot also uses repurchase agreements as a funding source 
repurchase agreements are generally short term obligations collateralized by government agency and other securities 
during  fhlb advances increased approximately million while repurchase agreements decreased approximately million 
this shift in the composition of the borrowing portfolio was the result of a strategy to extend the overall maturity of borrowings 
the following table presents certain information regarding borrowed funds at december  average average average balance rate balance rate balance rate fhlb advances    repurchase agreements   trust preferred    total borrowings outstanding    short term less than year    long term over year    total borrowings outstanding    stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity was  at december  compared to  at december  the increase was primarily a result of net income less cash dividends paid and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
patriot s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on investment and mortgage backed securities  fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit inflows and loan and mortgage backed security prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  general interest rates and competition 
therefore  patriot manages its balance sheet to provide adequate liquidity based upon various economic  interest rate and competitive assumptions and in light of profitability measures 
during  significant liquidity was provided by investment securities maturities and mortgage backed securities repayments of  mortgage loan repayments of  and core deposit growth of  the funds provided by these activities were utilized to pay off  of patriot s more costly wholesale certificates of deposit and increase its investment in commercial loans and leases by  at december   patriot had outstanding loan commitments of  patriot anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled  based upon historical experience  patriot expects that substantially all of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained at maturity  excluding wholesale certificates in the amount of  capital resources 
fdic regulations currently require companies to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of not less than of tier capital to total adjusted assets  a tier capital ratio of not less than of risk adjusted assets  and a minimum risk based total capital ratio based upon credit risk of not less than 
the fdic requires a minimum leverage capital requirement of for institutions rated composite under the camel rating system 
for all other institutions  the minimum leverage capital requirement is plus at least an additional to to basis points 
a bank is considered well capitalized if it maintains a minimum leverage capital ratio of not less than of tier capital to total adjusted assets  a tier capital ratio of not less than of risk adjusted assets  and a minimum risk based total capital ratio based upon credit risk of not less than 
patriot bank has voluntarily agreed with its regulators to maintain capital ratios at least equal to well capitalized standards and to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least 
at december   patriot bank s and patriot bank corp

   patriot bank    management of interest rate risk 
the principal objective of patriot s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain on and off balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given patriot s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  patriot seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
patriot monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
patriot s board of directors has established an asset liability committee comprised of senior management and directors  which is responsible for reviewing its asset liability and interest rate position and making decisions involving asset liability considerations 
the asset liability committee meets regularly and reports trends and patriot s interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
the company uses three complementary methods to analyze and measure interest rate risk as part of the overall management of interest rate risk 
they are income simulation modeling  estimates of economic value of equity  and static gap analysis 
the combination of these three methods provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the levels of interest rate risk of the company when exposed to time factors and changes in interest rate environments 
income simulation modeling is utilized in measuring patriot s interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company has calculated an estimate of net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments in existence at december  patriot has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling in monthly increments rate ramps 
rate ramps assume that all interest rates increase or decrease in monthly increments evenly throughout the period modeled 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the year ending december  resulting from changes in interest rates 
rate ramp to interest rates change economic value of equity eve estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities 
as part of this evaluation the company has contracted with an independent consultant to perform an extensive core deposit analysis to appropriately estimate the discounted present value of the retail deposit franchise 
upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility in relation to such interest rate movements in relation to an unchanged environment 
this method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer term repricing risks and options in the company s balance sheet 
the company has established policy limits for upward and downward rate shocks of of economic value of equity at risk for every basis points of interest rate shock 
additionally the company has a policy limit that the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets will be maintained above a ratio 
the following table reflects the estimated economic value of equity at risk and the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets at december   resulting from shocks to interest rates 
percent change eve equity rate shock from base eve assets base the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be repaid and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans

includes investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale and held to maturity 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans and is reduced for the allowance for loan losses  and unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities 
annual prepayment rates for loans and mortgage backed securities have been estimated utilizing historical analysis and industry expectations 
money market accounts  savings accounts  and now accounts decay rates have been estimated based upon a historical analysis of core deposit trends 
as shown above  the company has a positive gap interest sensitive assets are greater than interest sensitive liabilities within the next year  which generally indicates that an increase in rates may lead to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in rates may lead to a decrease in net interest income 
interest sensitivity gap analysis measures whether assets or liabilities may reprice but does not capture the ability to reprice or the range of potential repricing on assets or liabilities 
thus indications based on a positive or negative gap position need to be analyzed in conjunction with other interest rate risk management tools 
the company s management believes that the assumptions and combination of methods utilized in evaluating estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based
