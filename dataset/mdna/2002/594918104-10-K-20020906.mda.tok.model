item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations for   and management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in issues and uncertainties 
revenue the company s revenue growth rate was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal revenue growth in fiscal was led by the addition of xbox video game system revenue and the strong penetration of microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems 
revenue growth in fiscal was driven primarily by licensing of microsoft windows professional  microsoft sql server  and the other 
net enterprise servers 
revenue growth in fiscal was driven by strong licensing of microsoft windows nt workstation  windows professional  windows nt server  windows server  microsoft office  and sql server 
microsoft continued to see a mix shift to volume licensing programs 
on october   microsoft launched licensing to simplify and improve its volume licensing programs  including a simplified approach to software upgrades 
one feature of licensing is software assurance which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage 
the success of microsoft s new volume licensing programs will continue to affect the mix of multi year licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  the timing and extent of a recovery in consumer and corporate spending on pcs and information technology it will be factors affecting revenue growth 
product revenue in fiscal  microsoft had four segments desktop and enterprise software and services  consumer software  services  and devices  consumer commerce investments  and other 
the revenue figures in this management s discussion and analysis md a differ from those reported in the company s segment information appearing in note of the notes to financial statements 
the revenue figures in the segment information represent amounts reported internally for management reporting  while the revenue figures in the md a reflect revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
on july   microsoft revised its product segments and will begin reporting the new segments in fiscal desktop and enterprise software and services 
desktop and enterprise software and services revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and desktop and enterprise software and services includes desktop applications  desktop platforms  and enterprise software and services 
desktop applications revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and desktop applications includes revenue from microsoft office  microsoft project  visio  client access licenses cals for windows nt server and windows server  exchange  and backoffice  microsoft great plains  and bcentral 
in fiscal  office licensing revenue declined during the year due to a strong mix shift to multi year annuity licensing agreements  which deferred revenue recognition to future years  and a decrease in consumer purchases in the asia region  most notably japan  partially offset by strong oem licensing 
revenue from client access licenses grew in fiscal and revenue from great plains contributed to the growth in desktop applications 
in fiscal  revenue from client access licenses increased reflecting strong licensing growth of windows nt server and windows server cals 
office revenue growth was flat during fiscal in fiscal  revenue growth from microsoft office integrated suites  including the premium  professional  small business  and standard editions was very solid 
desktop platforms revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and desktop platforms includes revenue from windows xp professional and home  windows professional  windows nt workstation  windows me  windows  and other desktop operating systems 
in fiscal  the growth in desktop platforms revenue reflected strong multi year licensing revenue growth and a continued mix shift to the higher priced windows and windows xp professional operating system through oems  despite a decline in reported oem unit shipments 
fiscal revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of windows professional  partially offset by flat revenue growth from windows me and windows operating systems  reflecting the slowdown in consumer pc shipments and a higher mix of windows professional and windows nt workstation 
in fiscal  desktop platforms revenue growth was modest due to soft demand for business pcs during most of the year  a slowdown in shipments in anticipation of the post mid year availability of windows operating systems  and  as expected  a longer business migration cycle for the newest windows operating system offerings 
the rate of growth in pc shipments and the mix of windows and windows xp professional as a percentage of all bit operating systems will continue to impact revenue growth in the future 
enterprise software and services revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and enterprise software and services includes server platforms  server applications  developer tools and services  and enterprise services 
in fiscal  server applications  including microsoft sql server and 
net enterprise servers  increased compared to fiscal server platform revenue  which includes windows server and windows nt server operating systems  increased versus fiscal driven by a modest overall increase in windows based server shipments and increased deployment of windows server 
enterprise services revenue  representing consulting and product support services  was up compared to fiscal  while revenue from developer tools and services was down from fiscal in fiscal  server applications revenue increased versus the prior year as a result of msft form k 
table of contents part ii item the continued adoption of microsoft s 
net enterprise server offerings 
enterprise services revenue in fiscal  was up compared to fiscal and server platforms increased while revenue from developer tools and services was flat 
in fiscal  server platforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by customers of windows nt server and windows server 
revenue from server applications grew strongly in fiscal  largely due to the strong success of sql server  while software developer tools and services revenue declined  due to increased suite licensing versus stand alone licenses  and the lack of a release upgrade of the visual studio development system 
consumer software  services  and devices 
consumer software  services  and devices revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and consumer software  services  and devices includes the xbox video game system  msn internet access  msn network service  pc and online games  learning and productivity software  mobility  and embedded systems 
the majority of the revenue growth from fiscal stemmed from sales of the xbox video game system released in fiscal msn internet access revenue increased as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs 
revenue from msn network services increased despite a declining internet advertising market 
revenue from embedded systems in fiscal grew nicely  however learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games declined compared to fiscal in fiscal  revenue from msn network services grew strongly despite a decline in the online advertising market 
msn internet access revenue also grew solidly from fiscal as a result of an increased subscriber base  partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs 
revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the prior year  while learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games revenue declined  reflecting softness in the overall consumer market 
in fiscal  online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher subscriber totals  offset by lower net prices for internet access subscriptions compared to the prior year 
additionally  strong sales of entertainment software in fiscal produced robust revenue growth in pc and online games 
consumer commerce investments 
consumer commerce investments revenue was million  million  and million in   and consumer commerce investments include expedia  inc  the homeadvisor online real estate service  and the carpoint online automotive service 
the decline in revenue compared to fiscal reflects the sale of microsoft s majority ownership of expedia  inc to usa networks  inc 
on february  acquisitions of travelscape 
com and vacationspot 
com by expedia  inc  and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal the increased overall reach of all properties led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal other 
other revenue  which primarily includes hardware and microsoft press  was million  million  and million in   and in fiscal  continued declines in the it book and consumer market led to a decline in microsoft press and hardware sales 
lower sales of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal continued success of the company s new hardware device offerings led to revenue growth in fiscal distribution channels microsoft distributes its products primarily through the following channels oem  volume licensing  online services and products  and distributors and retailers 
oem channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who preinstall microsoft products  primarily on pcs 
microsoft has three major geographic sales and marketing regions the south pacific and americas region  the europe  middle east  and africa region  and the asia region 
sales of volume licenses and packaged software products via these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers 
oem revenue was billion in  billion in  and billion in in fiscal  reported licenses declined compared to fiscal however  a strong increase in the mix of the higher priced windows and windows xp professional licenses  and healthy growth in direct and system builder oems licenses  led to higher average revenue per license and contributed to the overall oem revenue growth over fiscal in fiscal  while total licenses were also impacted by a slowdown in pc shipments  the mix of the higher priced windows professional and windows nt workstation increased substantially resulting in higher average revenue per license 
a relatively low growth rate in fiscal was due to lower business pc shipment growth combined with post mid year availability of windows professional 
average earned revenue per license also declined in fiscal compared to the prior year  due in part to a mix shift to the lower priced windows operating system reflecting the softness in demand for business pcs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain oem channel sectors 
south pacific and americas region revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and in fiscal  the majority of the revenue growth was driven by sales of the xbox video game system released during the year  as well as strong windows xp professional licensing  msn subscription revenue  and revenue from microsoft great plains 
in fiscal  revenue growth was led by strong licensing of windows professional and the family of 
net enterprise servers  particularly sql server and exchange server 
revenue from enterprise services and msn subscription and services also grew strongly in fiscal in fiscal  office integrated suites  windows server  online revenue  and sql server sales were the primary drivers of the revenue growth 
strong retail sales of hardware devices and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year 
europe  middle east  and africa region revenue was billion  billion  and billion in   and in fiscal  the majority of the growth was a result of strong multi year licensing revenue of windows xp home and professional operating systems and enterprise software  as well as the addition of xbox video game system revenue in the second half of the year 
in fiscal  weakening local currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year  while revenue from windows professional and the 
net enterprise server family of products was very healthy 
in fiscal  retail sales of windows operating systems and msft form k 
table of contents part ii item office licensing produced moderate growth in the region 
growth from sql server licensing  new hardware device offerings  and entertainment software was especially strong 
asia region revenue was billion in  billion in  and billion in in fiscal  asia region revenue declined most notably due to lower consumer pc shipments  which hampered revenue from localized versions of microsoft office and microsoft office xp  especially the office personal edition 
xbox video game system sales partially offset the decline in office revenue 
in fiscal  the region s growth rate reflected strong revenue from localized versions of microsoft office and microsoft office xp  especially the office personal edition 
this growth was also attributable to windows professional and 
net server applications licensing 
in fiscal  the region s growth rate reflected strong performance resulting from improved local economic conditions 
revenue growth was also influenced by robust growth of localized versions of microsoft office  especially the office personal edition sold in japan  windows platform and server licensing  and strong adoption of sql server 
the company s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates 
approximately   and of the company s revenue was collected in foreign currencies during   and since a portion of local currency revenue is hedged and much of the company s international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the impact of exchange rates is partially mitigated 
operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was in  in  and in cost of revenue in fiscal increased primarily due to costs related to xbox 
in fiscal  higher support and service costs associated with the msn internet access and msn network services were partially offset by the lower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in the mix of packaged product versus the prior year 
cost of revenue in fiscal reflected lower costs associated with webtv networks operations  partially offset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs 
research and development 
the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in fiscal in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  offset the growth in headcount and development costs 
in fiscal  the increase in r d expense was the result of higher headcount related costs and investments in new product initiatives 
the increase in fiscal was driven primarily by higher headcount related costs 
prospectively  increased headcount and increased spending in server platforms  home entertainment  business solutions and ce are currently expected to be significant factors affecting future research and development expense growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was in  in  and in in fiscal  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower relative msn customer acquisition marketing and the large relative increase associated with the onset of xbox video game system revenue 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative headcount related costs  higher marketing and sales expenses associated with msn  the microsoft agility advertising campaign  and other new sales initiatives 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs associated with new product releases and online marketing 
microsoft expects that it will increase spending on information worker  server platforms  and business solutions sales forces and windows client  msn and home entertainment marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased due to a charge of approximately million for estimated expenses related to the company s consumer class action lawsuits and higher legal fees 
in fiscal  general and administrative costs decreased due to a charge related to the settlement of the lawsuit with caldera  inc recorded in fiscal excluding this charge in fiscal  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased from the prior year due to higher headcount related costs and legal fees 
for fiscal  besides the settlement of the lawsuit  general and administrative expenses also reflected increased legal fees and certain employee stock option related expenses 
non operating items  investment income loss  and income taxes losses on equity investees and other consists of microsoft s share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method  and income or loss attributable to minority interests 
the decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal was attributed to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal reflects an increase in the number of such investments during the year

interest and dividend income increased million from fiscal  reflecting a larger investment portfolio 
in fiscal year  investment income increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by cash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities 
at june   unrealized losses on equity and other investments of million were deemed to be temporary in nature 
the following  among other factors  could result in some investments being deemed other than temporarily impaired in future periods changes in the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
in connection with the definitive agreement to combine at t broadband with comcast in a new company to be called at t comcast corporation  microsoft has agreed to exchange its at t convertible preferred debt securities for approximately million shares of at t comcast corporation 
it is expected that the transaction will close by december  while it is possible that microsoft could incur a loss on this exchange transaction up to the carrying value of the at t debt securities  management believes that the ultimate loss  if any  will be significantly less 
as management is unable to predict whether there will be a gain or loss on the exchange  no loss has been recorded related to this contingent exchange transaction as of june  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings 
accounting changes effective july   microsoft adopted sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill

the adoption of sfas resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction to income of million million after tax and a cumulative pre tax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of million million after tax 
the reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately million reclassified from oci for the time value of options and a loss of approximately million reclassified from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
the reduction to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately million loss for the time value of options and the approximately million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments 
financial condition the company s cash and short term investment portfolio totaled billion at june  the portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities  diversified among industries and individual issuers

application of critical accounting policies microsoft s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for microsoft include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
end users receive certain elements of the company s products over a period of time 
these elements include browser technologies updates and technical support  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired  which also requires judgment 
in making this judgment  microsoft evaluates  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including factors such as industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
microsoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or other msft form k 
table of contents part ii item wise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  the company expenses all research and development costs when incurred 
microsoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
issues and uncertainties the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s financial outlook 
challenges to the company s business model 
since its inception  the company s business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by microsoft 
under this commercial software development csd model  software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development  offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products 
the company believes that the csd model has had substantial benefits for users of software  allowing them to rely on the expertise of the company and other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful  reliable and compatible with other software and hardware 
in recent years  there has been a growing challenge to the csd model  often referred to as the open source movement 
under the open source model  software is produced by global communities of programmers  and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at little or no cost 
the company believes that there are significant problems with the open source model  the principal drawback being that no single entity is responsible for the open source software  and thus users have no recourse if a product does not work properly or at all 
further  without the market incentives associated with the csd model  the company believes that the vigorous innovation and growth of the software industry over the last years would not have occurred 
nonetheless  the popularization of the open source movement continues to pose a significant challenge to the company s business model  including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products 
to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance  sales of the company s products may decline  the company may have to reduce the prices it charges for its products  and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline 
new products and services 
the company has made significant investments in research and development for new products  services and technologies  including microsoft 
net  xbox  business applications  msn  mobile and wireless technologies  and television 
significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
moreover  these products and services may never be profitable  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced in our desktop and enterprise software and services businesses 
declines in demand for software 
if overall market demand for pcs  servers and other computing devices declines significantly  and consumer and corporate spending for such products declines  microsoft s revenue growth will be adversely affected 
additionally  the company s revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products if such new offerings are not perceived to add significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 
product development schedule 
the development of software products is a complex and time consuming process 
new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact the company s revenues 
international operations 
microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world 
the prices of the company s products in countries outside of the united states are generally higher than the company s prices in the united states because of the cost incurred in localizing software for non us markets 
the costs of producing and selling the company s products in these countries also are higher 
pressure to globalize microsoft s pricing structure might require that the company reduce the sales price of its software in other countries  even though the costs of the software continue to be higher than in the united states 
unfavorable changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software  social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  including foreign exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potential adverse foreign tax consequences  among other factors  could also have a negative effect on the company s business and results of operations outside of the united states 
msft form k 
table of contents part ii item intellectual property rights 
microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights  but unlicensed copying and use of software represents a loss of revenue to the company 
while this adversely affects us revenue  revenue loss is even more significant outside the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
throughout the world  microsoft actively educates consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected 
however  continued efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue 
taxation of extraterritorial income 
in august  a world trade organization wto dispute panel determined that the extraterritorial tax eti provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures agreement 
the us government appealed the panel s decision and lost its appeal 
on january   the wto dispute settlement body adopted the appellate body report 
president bush has stated the us will bring its tax laws into compliance with the wto ruling  but the administration and congress have not decided on a solution for this issue 
in july  representative bill thomas  chairman of the house ways and means committee  introduced the american competitiveness and corporate accountability act of if enacted  that bill would repeal the eti regime and introduce broad based international reform 
the proposed reforms would not materially affect the company 
on august   a wto arbitration panel determined that the european union may impose up to billion per year in countermeasures if the us rules are not brought into compliance 
the wto decision does not repeal the eti tax benefit and it does not require the european union to impose trade sanctions  so it is not possible to predict what impact the wto decision will have on future results pending final resolution of these matters 
if the eti exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted  the loss of tax benefit to the company could be significant 
litigation 
as discussed in note contingencies of the notes to financial statements  the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits 
while the company believes that none of the litigation matters in which the company is currently involved will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that would ultimately have a material adverse impact on the business of the company  and could negatively impact its revenues and operating margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and equity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company hedges the exposure of accounts receivable and a portion of anticipated revenue to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
the company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
the company routinely uses options to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates 
many securities held in the company s equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk 
the company uses options to hedge its price risk on certain highly volatile equity securities 
the company uses a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify its market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of the company s portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion  which allow incorporation of optionality of these exposures 
for interest rates  the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed income securities prices over time revert to maturity value 
value at risk is calculated by  first  simulating  market price paths over days for equities  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
each resulting unique set of equities prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates is applied to substantially all individual holdings to re price each holding 
the th worst performance out of  represents the value at risk over days at the th percentile 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
a substantial amount of the company s equity portfolio is held for strategic purposes 
the company attempts to hedge the value of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as collars 
the company has incurred substantial impairment charges related to certain of these securities in fiscal and fiscal such impairment charges have been incurred primarily for strategic equity holdings that the company has not been able to hedge 
the var amounts disclosed below are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  as they are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of the company s portfolio 
losses in fair value over a day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the day holding period used in the var analysis 
the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency  and equity risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
historical data is used to estimate var 
given reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
msft form k 
table of contents part ii item a  the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of the company s positions in millions as of june  year ended june  risk categories average high low interest rates currency rates equity prices the total var for the combined risk categories is million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june  and less at june  than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table  due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks 
the reasons for the change in risk in portfolios include larger investment portfolio size  higher foreign exchange exposure due to stronger non us currencies  and asset allocation shifts
