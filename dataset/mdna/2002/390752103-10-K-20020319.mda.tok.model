item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands results of operations trends in  occupancy rates in the current markets declined due to increases in supply and decreases in demand for office space 
the company s properties were affected by this market trend and as a result  the overall portfolio occupancy of the company s properties declined from at the end of to at the end of occupancy declines in the company s portfolio of properties adversely impact the company s revenue growth 
the company does not expect that the overall market trends will change in as a result  the company expects that overall portfolio occupancy will decline to approximately at the end of and that revenues and net income will decrease slightly in as compared to as of march   several tenants were in default under their leases for failure to make rent payments 
the largest of these tenants  an affiliate of psinet  inc  that occupies  square feet in one of our minneapolis area properties  is not expected to meet its rent payment obligations 
in addition  several other tenants that are not currently in default are experiencing financial difficulties which may lead to lease defaults 
these tenant defaults may adversely impact the company s revenue in critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate whether accounts receivable from tenants are collectible using the specific identification method 
in circumstances where a specific tenant has defaulted on its financial obligations to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we think will be collected 
if a tenant s circumstances change an unexpected material adverse change in a tenant s financial condition that precludes them from meeting their financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
revenue recognition reimbursement income under the terms of our tenant leases  tenants pay a portion of the real estate taxes and property operating expenses of the property they occupy to us as reimbursement income 
tenants generally pay an estimate of these amounts to us monthly 
as of december of each year  we record as a receivable any additional amounts due in excess of the monthly estimates paid to us by the tenant even though the amount due will not be billed to the tenant until the next calendar year 
such amounts recorded do vary from the actual amounts billed to the tenants but the differences in prior years have not been material 
accrued real estate taxes use of estimates for certain properties owned by us  real estate taxes for the current calendar year are not due and payable until the next calendar year 
we estimate the amounts due the local taxing authorities based on historical trends for a particular property or local area 
we also use information from our consultants who review the methodology used by the local taxing authorities to determine the real estate taxes we owe 
if a local taxing authority were to change the methodology it uses to determine real estate taxes  the amounts estimated to be paid in future years could vary from our estimates 
fair value of interest rate swap agreements we value these agreements based on information provided to us by a third party 
if we were to use a different party to help us value these agreements  the fair value could materially change

item a market risk dollars in thousands the company s interest income is sensitive to changes in the general levels of us short term interest rates 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us short term and long term interest rates as the company has outstanding indebtedness at fixed and variable rates 
the company s variable rate debt under the credit facility bears interest at libor plus to per annum depending on the company s overall leverage 
increases in libor rates would increase the company s interest expense and reduce its cash flow 
conversely  declines in libor rates would decrease the company s interest expense and increase its cash flow

one agreement has a term of two years and fixes the interest rate on  of the company s unsecured credit facility at a maximum of

at december   the company had  of fixed rate debt outstanding at an average rate of including the effect of the two swap agreements 
if the general level of interest rates in the united states were to fall  the company would not likely have the opportunity to refinance this fixed rate debt at lower interest rates due to prepayment restrictions and penalties on its fixed rate debt 
in general  the company believes long term fixed rate debt is preferable as a financing vehicle for its operations due to the long term fixed contractual rental income the company receives from its tenants 
as a result  the company has of its long term debt outstanding at december  at fixed rates including the debt affected by the swap agreements
